<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Population aging across Europe raises concerns about the sustainability of pension systems and the financial security of retirees, particularly as large baby boom cohorts are now entering retirement. In most European countries, women receive lower pensions than men (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Hammerschmid &amp; Rowold, 2019)</ref>. Today, women's financial security in later life is shaped by two potentially conflicting developments. On the one hand, increasing family diversity, including rising shares of never-married and divorced women, can undermine financial security in old age at the household level, particularly in conservative welfare states that promote economic dependence on male breadwinners <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Fasang et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Schmauk &amp; Kridahl, 2024)</ref>. On the other, women's growing labour force participation strengthens their independent pension entitlements, raising personal retirement income. By comparing three financial outcomes, including the individual and household level, we offer a holistic perspective into how these developments relate to financial security in later life.</p><p>The comparison of West Germany and the Netherlands is particularly informative about which pension arrangements are most effective in securing women's financial security in old age within conservative welfare states <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Esping-Andersen, 1990)</ref>. In both countries, women of our study cohorts  experienced their work and family life courses in strongly conservative welfare state environments that encouraged female care or part-time work, marriage, and women's economic dependence on male breadwinners. However, the Dutch and German pension systems differ substantially. West Germany exemplifies a Bismarckian pension system, in which public pensions are the primary pension type and are closely tied to prior employment and earnings. The Netherlands represents a Beveridge system with a (nearly) universal basic pension and more widespread occupational pensions. Consequently, the Dutch welfare state is often classified as a hybrid welfare state with conservative, social-democratic, and, to a lesser extent, liberal elements <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Arts &amp; Gelissen, 2002)</ref>. Comparing women's financial security in the more privatized, yet also more universalistic, Dutch pension system to West Germany, where pension privatization is a more recent development and remains limited, allows us to identify which pension policies most effectively secure women's financial well-being in conservative welfare states. We build on the premises of differential life course sociology <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Fasang &amp; Mayer, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Mayer, 2005)</ref> by comparing specific birth cohorts in two countries to unpack how different policies that were in effect earlier and later in women's life courses jointly shape their work family life courses and financial well-being in old age (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Madero-Cabib &amp; Fasang, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Rowold et al., 2024</ref> for similar comparative approaches).</p><p>We address the following research questions: 1) Are women's typical work and family lifecourse patterns from ages 20-60 indeed similar in West Germany and the Netherlands, given similar conservative family and labor market policies? 2) How are similar work and family life-course patterns in Germany and the Netherlands differentially rewarded by the Dutch and German pension systems? Specifically, which typical work and family life-course patterns are associated with greater financial security in Germany or in the Netherlands? We answer these questions using data from the Survey of Health, Aging and Retirement (SHARE), multichannel sequence analysis, cluster analysis, and regression methods.</p><p>Our contribution to the literature is twofold. First, we present a theoretically motivated country comparison to inform which pension policies more effectively secure financial security for women in later life, whose work-family life courses have evolved in conservative welfare state environments.</p><p>Second, we add to previous studies with a more comprehensive measurement financial security in old age by focusing on three indicators of financial security: Independent individual pensions as an indicator of financial autonomy, derived individual pensions (i.e., survivor benefits), and household equivalence income as an indicator of actual living standards, assuming that income is split equally among household members.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Previous Literature</head><p>Previous research linking women's work and family life courses to financial security in later life has largely relied on single-country studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Mika &amp; Czaplicki, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Peeters &amp; De Tavernier, 2015)</ref> or large-N cross-national comparisons <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Ebbinghaus, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Möhring, 2015</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Möhring, , 2018</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Möhring, , 2021))</ref>. More recently, small-N comparative studies have emerged that use theoretically motivated designs to disentangle how institutional factors at different points in women's lives shape their financial security in later life <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Fasang et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Madero-Cabib &amp; Fasang, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Rowold et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Schmauk &amp; Kridahl, 2024)</ref>.</p><p>At the individual level, findings are consistent: women with care-oriented life courses receive particularly low pensions in Europe <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Fasang et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Madero-Cabib &amp; Fasang, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Möhring, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Rowold et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Sefton et al., 2011)</ref>. Mothers fare worse than childless women <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Dotti Sani &amp; Luppi, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Möhring, 2018)</ref>, and married women with weak labor market attachment and many children tend to have very low independent pensions. By contrast, divorced, single, and never-married women often achieve higher individual entitlements <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Fasang et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Möhring, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Schmauk &amp; Kridahl, 2024)</ref>.</p><p>A growing body of research investigates variation in these outcomes across countries.</p><p>Employment and family trajectories, as well as the way pension systems incorporate them, determine retirement outcomes (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Conservative regimes generally exhibit the largest gender pension gaps, and West Germany and the Netherlands are no exception, with gaps of 48.8 and 42.3 percent, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Hammerschmid &amp; Rowold, 2019)</ref>. Despite different pension system characteristics in Germany and the Netherlands, large parts of this gap are linked to gender-exclusive employment experiences in both countries, particularly the lowly rewarded unpaid care work almost exclusively performed by women <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Rowold, 2025)</ref>.</p><p>The effects of pension policies on women's pension income go beyond general welfare regime typologies. Three studies by <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Möhring (2015</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Möhring ( , 2018</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Möhring ( , 2021</ref>) use a large-N comparative design to investigate the relationship between life courses, motherhood and pension outcomes across Europe.</p><p>The studies show similar patterns: A weaker relationship between employment trajectories and pension outcomes in countries with a strong and (nearly) universal basic pension, often combined with quasimandatory occupational pensions, like in the Netherlands. A great share of private pensions, on the other hand, has negative consequences for the pension outcomes of those with weak labor market attachment (often women), unless combined with a strong redistributive public pension system <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Möhring, 2015)</ref>. Dotti <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Sani and Luppi (2021)</ref> arrive at similar conclusions with regards to the positive impact of a universal basic pension when investigating the consequences of absences after childbirth.</p><p>On the other hand, pension systems with a 'childcare credits' system, intended to compensate for mothers' absences from the labor market, do not perform well in international comparison <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Möhring, 2018)</ref>. This is further supported by studies on the West German context evidencing that childcare credits fail to fully compensate for the losses experienced through motherhood <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Mika &amp; Czaplicki, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Möhring et al., 2025)</ref>. Two small-N country studies find a stronger relationship between employment biographies and pension outcomes in the conservative West German welfare state when compared to the liberal system of the UK/Britian <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Fasang et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Sefton et al., 2011)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Madero-Cabib &amp; Fasang (2016)</ref> compare West Germany and Switzerland and find that care-oriented life courses are experience a higher pension penalty in the liberal Swiss system when compared to Germany.</p><p>Most comparative literature investigates women's financial outcomes at the individual level.</p><p>Fewer studies consider the household perspective. Using SHARE data, Möhring, (2021) finds that childbearing combined with employment interruptions lowers household income for women across Europe. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Madero-Cabib and Fasang (2016)</ref> show that women with part-time life courses experience lower household equivalence incomes in Switzerland than in Germany. In Germany, <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Weiland and Möhring (2020)</ref> show that women's employment interruptions reduce household income unless compensated by high partner earnings. Focusing not on household income but poverty, Ebbinghaus (2021) uses a large-N country comparison to show, analogous to individual pensions, that countries with a solid minimum public pensions fare best in terms of preventing poverty on the household level.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Background</head><p>Comparative research on women's work-family life courses and household-level outcomes remains sparse. Yet including the household perspective is crucial, especially in male-breadwinner contexts where household resources can buffer or mask individual-level insecurities. Building on existing small-N comparisons, our study examines the relationship between women's life courses and both individual and household income in West Germany and the Netherlands. We thereby contribute to understanding how male-breadwinner welfare states shape financial security in later life at both levels.</p><p>Our comparative design is based on the fundamental premises of differential life course sociology, which posits that different contextual conditions across individual life courses jointly shape later life outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Fasang, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Mayer, 2005)</ref>. Specifically, our study cohorts experienced similar conservative family and labour market policies during their family formation and working lives between 1950 and 2000 when they were between ages 20 and 50, but the pension systems differed substantially. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> illustrates our comparative design, detailed in Tables 1 (similarities in family and labour market policies) and 2 (differences in pension systems).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Similar Family and Labor Market Policies 1950-2000</head><p>In both countries, our study cohorts  experienced family formation and labor market trajectories in strong male breadwinner contexts, deeply rooted in cultural norms and reinforced by  , see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> Different Pension Policies <ref type="bibr">(2010)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2011)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2012)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2013)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2014)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2015)</ref>, see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> Work and family life courses (ages 20-60)</p><p>Financial security (age65+): 1) Individual Pensions 2) Survivor Benefits 3) Household Income policy measures <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(de Groot, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Trappe et al., 2015)</ref>. As a result, we assume similar work-family life course types in both countries (research question 1). Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> summarizes key similarities in conservative family and labor market policies for our study cohorts. Both countries applied joint taxation of married couples, which disincentivized female employment <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Klammer et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Knijn, 2004)</ref>. Marriage was culturally, but also legally, tied to exiting the workforce for women in both countries. The marriage bar for female civil servants in the Netherlands remained common in municipalities and private companies until it was banned in 1975 <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Visser, 2002)</ref>. In West Germany, husbands could terminate their wives' employment until 1977 on the grounds of neglect of 'marital and family duties' <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Allmendinger et al., 2008)</ref>. Conversely, childcare was mainly situated within households in both countries. The provision of day care for all became an explicit goal of the Dutch government only in 1989 <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Kuijsten &amp; Schulze, 1997)</ref>. Similarly, in West Germany, the lack of adequate childcare facilities, effectively placed childcare responsibilities mainly on women <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Trappe et al., 2015)</ref>. During the 1970s and 80s, both West Germany and the Netherlands saw a rise in women's part-time employment <ref type="bibr">(OECD, 2019)</ref>. The Netherlands institutionalized part-time work through inclusive labor market reforms in the 1990s, granting part-time workers nearly equal rights and fostering its acceptance across all sectors and social groups (OECD, 2019). In contrast, West Germany maintained a more conservative stance, supporting part-time work primarily as supplementary income, reinforcing traditional gender roles <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Rosenfeld et al., 2004)</ref>. However, given that the shift toward more inclusivity of part-time work in the Netherlands only happened in the 1990s, we assume that most women in our cohort were established in their employment trajectories by this point, following a more male breadwinner-oriented path with weak labor market attachment, similar to West German women.

This contrast presents an opportunity to examine how different pension designs influence the financial outcomes of life trajectories (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). The following paragraph describes the structure of public and occupational/private pensions in the two countries in turn, forming the basis for our hypotheses.

Public pensions in West Germany operate as an earnings-related pay-as-you-go system, covering most salaried employees. In 2015, 87 percent of individuals over 65 in West Germany received a statutory pension, a product of the low eligibility threshold at five contribution years (Bundesministerium für Arbeit und Soziales, 2016). In 2014, the statutory pension insurance accounted for 68.5 percent of total income among those aged 65 and older, making it the primary source of old-age income for most of the population <ref type="bibr">(OECD, 2015)</ref>. As a Bismarckian system, the German statutory pension insurance hence primarily aims to maintain individuals' pre-retirement income status. Hence, pension benefits are closely tied to prior contributions, which puts women at a disadvantage due to their less continuous employment histories <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Leitner, 2001)</ref>. Poverty prevention, by contrast, is not part of the pension system but is instead addressed through means-tested social assistance at the household level <ref type="bibr">(OECD, 2015)</ref>. However, the system also includes redistributive mechanisms that disproportionally benefit women. First, two measures provide additional pension credits to mothers: Child-reading benefits that equalled 12 months of an average salary per child in 2013, and the raising of part-time employment credits when combined with childcare <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Beckwermert, 2024)</ref>. Second, pension-splitting regulations upon divorce often benefit women by ensuring that pension entitlements accrued during marriage are evenly divided between former spouses <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Kreyenfeld et al., 2023)</ref>. Finally, Germany's survivor pension rules are relatively generous, granting widows aged 45 and older 60 percent of their deceased spouse's pension <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Börsch-Supan &amp; Wilke, 2004)</ref>.</p><p>Public pensions in the Netherlands are also organized through a pay-as-you go pension system.</p><p>However, as a Beveridge system, the eligibility is granted on the basis of residency, with 50 years making one eligible to the full amount <ref type="bibr">(OECD, 2015)</ref>. The pension is paid as a flat rate amount irrespective of prior contributions. It is somewhat means-tested in that the amount for couples is lower</p><p>(1,619.29€ in 2014) compared to individuals (1,149.48€) (OECD, 2015)<ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">4</ref> . Given the flat-rate structure, public pensions constitute a smaller share of the income of those aged 65 and older in the Net than in</p><p>West Germany, at 43.3 percent <ref type="bibr">(OECD, 2015)</ref>. The Dutch public pension system, in contrast to the German one, does not provide any additional redistributive mechanisms, divorce splitting, or survivor benefits to older women. Instead, the accessibility of the basic pension functions as a universal safety net.</p><p>Private and occupational pensions. Although the significance of second-and third-pillar pensions is increasing in West Germany, their role remains limited for our study cohort. Only about one-third of retirees overall received occupational and one-third received private pensions in 2014 and they jointly made up for only 15.1 percent of pension income of those aged 65 or older <ref type="bibr">(OECD, 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Occupational pensions are typically organized through the employer, private pensions are an individual responsibility (OECD, 2015).</p><p>In the Netherlands, in contrast, occupational pensions are crucial to status maintenance in retirement. In 2014, occupational pensions accounted for 39.7 percent of overall pension payments <ref type="bibr">(OECD, 2015)</ref>. They are, in most cases, organized as sector-wide funds. Participation is mandatory, which explains the wide coverage <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Frericks, 2013)</ref>. As in Germany, additional voluntary private pension plans exist, but made up only a small share of overall pension payments in 2014 (6.6 percent) <ref type="bibr">(OECD, 2015)</ref>.</p><p>In both the Netherlands and Germany, private and occupational pensions are subject to divorce splitting under legal regulations similar to those governing public pension benefits in Germany. In the Netherlands, survivor's benefits from occupational pension plans are another widespread feature, which is less substantial in Germany due to the lower spread of occupational pension plans overall <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Starink &amp; Visser, 2017)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Three Sources of Financial Security</head><p>We conceptualize financial security in later life based on the three routes through which women can acquire retirement income, which we use as a basis for operationalizing different financial outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Ginn et al., 2001)</ref> (see right-hand box in Fehler! Verweisquelle konnte nicht gefunden werden.).</p><p>(1) Individual Pensions Excluding Survivor Benefits refer to pension entitlements accumulated independently by individuals through public, occupational, or private pension schemes. These pensions can result from employment histories, citizenship, or redistributive mechanisms such as childcare credits. Individual pensions provide the highest degree of financial autonomy and minimize reliance on potentially unstable interpersonal relationships <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Ginn 2001)</ref>.</p><p>(2) Individual Pensions Including Survivor Benefits, which additionally include survivor benefits from all sources. <ref type="bibr">Ginn and colleagues (2001)</ref> refer to these as benefits derived from a (former) husband's pension entitlements. These benefits are typically tied to widowhood, which can hinder remarriage. Nonetheless, survivor benefits can offer crucial financial security for (widowed) women in later life <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Meyer &amp; Pfau-Effinger, 2006)</ref>.</p><p>Household Equivalence Income. Given the couple-centered living constellation of the majority of women within this cohort (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>), the husband's pension greatly contributes to household income <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Ginn et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Orloff, 1993)</ref>. This constellation implies a dependence on a partnership as such, its stability, and the economic resources of the partner. Yet, assuming that household income is shared among spouses, household income is an important indicator of women's standard of living in later life, particularly in male breadwinner contexts <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Leitner, 2001)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Summary of Hypotheses</head><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> summarizes our expectations. First, we assume that typical life-course patterns in both countries for women born between 1930 and 1950 are similar (Hypothesis 1). Specifically, employment and married motherhood were essentially competing alternatives for women <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Fasang &amp; Aisenbrey, 2022)</ref> . We assume a similar work-family interplay: most women will have care-oriented life courses of married motherhood and weak labor market attachment (Hypothesis 1a), and a minority will be full-time employed with non-normative family lives of being unmarried, childless or separated (Hypothesis 1b).</p><p>We are particularly interested in the ways in which the socially and politically encouraged conservative female life course with weak labor market attachment (e.g., characterized by longer spells of care work or part-time employment) relates to pension outcomes. For individual pensions excluding survivor benefits, we assume that Dutch women, outcomes are higher, especially for life courses characterized by low labour market attachment (Hypothesis 2). Previous research indicates that basic pensions, like the Dutch one, are more effective at increasing pensions of women and mothers than targeted approaches like the German childcare credit system (Dotti <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Sani &amp; Luppi, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Möhring, 2015</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Möhring, , 2018))</ref>. For our second outcome measure, we assume that including survivor benefits will lead to a larger increase in pensions in West Germany given the generous regulations that apply to this cohort (Hypothesis 3). However, given the limited number of widowed women in the sample, we assume that this will not compensate for the overall lower individual pensions in West Germany.</p><p>Lastly, we assume that household equivalence income is similar across life courses characterized by being in a partnership in both countries (Hypothesis 4). Partnered women likely benefit from their partners income in the two strong male breadwinner societies during the 20 th century. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Data</head><p>We used the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE). For the retrospective employment and family trajectories, we used waves 3 and 7 (SHARElife). During waves 6 and 7, the Netherlands did not participate in SHARElife. Therefore, we only use retrospective information for individuals who participated in wave 3 for the Netherlands. We used cross-sectional information from wave 5 on pension outcomes where an observation at age 65 or older is available. If this information was missing, information from other waves was used to maximize the sample size in the following order: 4, 2, 6, 7, 8 and 9. This order was chosen because the waves up to wave 5 separated individual and derived occupational pensions, while the newer waves (6 to 9) do not. For household income we used the same wave as for pension income. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref> shows that the majority of the data comes from wave 5 in both countries (63-64 percent).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Sample</head><p>Our sample included women who were born in the Netherlands or Germany between 1930 and 1950.</p><p>For women in Germany, we also required that they lived in West Germany in 1989 at the time of reunification. All participants must have participated in SHARElife and have employment and family histories from age 20 to 60 with gaps of two years maximum. Those with remaining missing values were excluded from the analyses 5 . In addition, we required at least one observation on pensions after age 64 and on household income, with no missing control variables in the respective year ( 5 For a full overview over our sample restriction, see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">A1</ref> in the Appendix.</p><p>Table 4) 6 . For more details, please also see sections 2 and 3 in the Appendix. 6 If a respondent answers 'no' to receiving a pension, their outcome is recorded as zero, but they remain in the dataset. We had slightly more German women in our sample (57.6 percent compared to 42.4 percent of Dutch women, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>). Overall, characteristics were very similar across countries. Substantial differences were only visible for education and migration background. The share of women who only reach basic education was much higher in the Netherlands (61.8 percent compared to 25.6 percent of German women). A larger share was foreign-born in Germany, which we controlled for in our regression models.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Operationalization</head><p>Employment and Family Trajectories. We constructed retrospective employment and family biographies between ages 20 and 60 from the SHARElife questionnaires. We used the Job Episodes Panel, that facilitates the analysis of employment biographies <ref type="bibr">(Brugiavini et al., 2013</ref><ref type="bibr">(Brugiavini et al., , 2019))</ref>. We choose the states for the sequences aiming to minimize complexity while fulfilling our theoretical guidelines <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Scherer &amp; Brüderl, 2010)</ref>. For the employment trajectories, we used six different states:</p><p>'education', 'full-time work', 'part-time work', 'caring for home or family', 'unemployed, sick, disabled, retired or other'. The subsumption of unemployment, sickness, disability and retirement into a single spell was due to the rarity of these states. Our choice of family states was grounded in the focus on marriage as a legal institution tied to pension rights (e.g. pension splitting upon divorce, survivor benefits) and the presence of children, acknowledging the well-documented motherhood penalty in pensions <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Möhring, 2018)</ref>: 'unmarried, childless', 'unmarried, with child(ren)', 'married, childless', 'married, with child(ren)', 'divorced', and 'widowed'. Divorce and widowhood included both mothers and childless women, since both states are quite rare.</p><p>Individual Pension (Excl. Survivor Benefits). For the individual pension measure, we added income from public, occupational, and private pensions based on individuals own entitlements, as well as annual life insurance payments. Since the share of pension entitlements derived from pension splitting upon divorce was not distinguishable from individual entitlements, these also fell under this first measure. From a conceptual standpoint, counting pension splitting toward independent pensions is reasonable, because pension splitting creates personal, stable rights that do not depend on future partnerships or means-testing.</p><p>Individual Pension (Incl. Survivor Benefits) combine individual entitlements and survivor's benefits from public pensions (all waves) and occupational pensions (up to wave 5, see specifics of operationalization in Appendix section 3).</p><p>Household Income uses the thinc2 variable which is based on aggregated information from individual SHARE questionnaires and includes imputations provided by the SHARE team. Assuming joint financial management within the household, we used the square root equivalence scale by dividing household income by the number of household members. All outcome measures are adjusted for purchasing power in the given country and year and top coded at the 95 th percentile to avoid outliers driving our results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Empirical Strategy</head><p>Our empirical strategy proceeds in two steps:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>1) Multichannel Sequence-&amp; Cluster Analysis.</head><p>To analyze work-family life courses, we applied multichannel sequence analysis (MSQA), treating each individual's trajectory as a sequence of states in employment and family <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Madero-Cabib &amp; Fasang, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Rowold et al., 2024)</ref>. MSQA calculates pairwise distances between sequences across both channels. In calculating the distances, we used an optimal matching method where the cost of aligning two sequences was calculated using insertion/deletion and substitution (with the latter being double the cost). Then, we ran a cluster analysis revealing different types of trajectories, using a Ward algorithm. In choosing the parameters (distance measure and cluster algorithm), we used a twofold strategy in finding an optimal solution:</p><p>Firstly, we used statistical goodness-of-fit measures to find the optimal cluster solution(s) for different distance measures and clustering algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Studer (2013)</ref>, see also Appendix section 5). We then used theoretical considerations to choose the optimal solution for our research interest.</p><p>2) Linear regression. In the second step, we used the cluster membership as a predictor in a linear regression model on the three outcome measures: Individual pensions excluding survivor benefits, those including survivor benefits, and household equivalence income. We controlled for cohort (dummy indicating whether participant was born before 1940), the wave of the outcome measure and nativity. We also included a dummy indicating at least 10 years of employment in civil service, which we interacted with country to control for the separate civil servant pensions scheme in Germany.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Results</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>: Results of the Multichannel Sequence and Cluster Analysis ). The fifth, Non-Employed/ Unemployed and Early Retired Mothers cluster also falls within this umbrella, although the reasons for absence from the labor market seem to be more diverse in this case.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Similar work-family life courses in West Germany and the Netherlands</head><p>Cluster 5 is characterized by a great share of early retirement, followed by employment and voluntary and community work (see Appendix Table <ref type="table">A6</ref>). The three clusters jointly make up for about two thirds of the sample in both countries. The traditional family structures and weak labour market attachment of women in these clusters reflect the male breadwinner model that prevailed at the time, thereby validating our expectations regarding the similarity of the cohort in the two countries (Hypothesis 1 supported). Moreover, in line with expectations (Hypothesis 1b), women with stronger labor force attachment are a small minority and more often experienced non-normative family lives (cluster 4 and 6).</p><p>A minority of clusters deviates from the male breadwinner ideal. Cluster 3, Full-Time Employed Mothers, is more prevalent in West Germany than in the Netherlands (23.5 percent versus 12.6 percent). Additional insights into the characteristics and income distribution of this cluster reveals substantial heterogeneities within the full-time employed mothers, implying a broad range of selection mechanisms into this life course type (Appendix Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">A2</ref> and Figures <ref type="figure">A4-A6</ref>). In Cluster 4, Non-Traditional Family Lives and Mixed Employment, Dutch women are slightly overrepresented (12.1 percent versus 6.9 percent). In this cluster, family structures deviate from the dominant ideal of continuous marriage, with some individuals remaining unmarried, others experiencing early divorce or widowhood. The employment trajectories are characterized by a high degree of heterogeneity, with more full-time employment than in the care-dominated clusters 1 and 2 (see Table <ref type="table">A5</ref>). Lastly, the Childless Wives cluster (6) represents a very small share of women who were married but did not have children. Similarly to the Non-Traditional Family Lives cluster, employment trajectories are mixed for this group but with generally stronger labor force attachment. Overall, in line with our expectations, most women in our sample adhere to a male breadwinner or 1.5 earner constellation, with only a minority of life courses deviating from this ideal.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Different Associations between work-family life courses and financial security in later life in</head><p>West Germany and the Netherlands  Other clusters show less pronounced country differences but reveal some interesting patterns.</p><p>The 'part-time employed mothers' cluster (Cluster 2) yield similar mean individual pensions as the 'full-time employed mothers' cluster (Cluster 3) in both countries. There could be several reasons for this similarity between full-and part-time working mothers. Most notably, negative selection into the 'full-time employed mothers' cluster of women with lower education and earnings, which are discussed in detail in the appendix (section 5). Nevertheless, the similar pension levels between parttime and full-time clusters also highlight the generally poor pension outcomes for women in full-time employment.</p><p>Women in the 'non-traditional family lives and mixed employment' cluster (Cluster 4) and the 'childless wives' cluster (Cluster 6) received the highest individual pensions in both countries. These outcomes reflect several potential mechanisms. Some family trajectories in cluster 4 include divorce (which means some women may have benefitted from pension splitting regulations), while others are characterized by early widowhood, which may have pushed some women into the labor force. For cluster 6 especially, fewer caregiving responsibilities may have enabled higher lifetime earnings.</p><p>While our study is not designed to test these mechanisms directly, we provide an overview of individual pensions by current marital status for Cluster 4 (see Appendix Figure <ref type="figure">A7</ref>). The higher pensions for women in cluster 4 who are not married, divorced or widowed compared to the married women support our interpretation.</p><p>Including survivor benefits (Figure <ref type="figure">B</ref>) substantially increases predicted pensions in both West</p><p>Germany (by about 16 percent to 9,969 Euros/year) and the Netherlands (by about 7 percent to 12,185 Euros/year). This supports hypothesis 3, which held that increases would be higher in West Germany.</p><p>The magnitude of survivor pensions varies by cluster. Receiving survivor benefits depends on widowhood and the pension income of the deceased spouse, and widowhood prevalence differs across clusters (see Appendix Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">A4</ref>). Hence, once we include survivor benefits, the increase in predicted pensions is largest for cluster 6, where the share of widows is the highest. Nonetheless, the inclusion of survivor benefits did not substantially alter our interpretation with regard to individual pensions:</p><p>The homemaker cluster continus to show significant country differences even after including survivor benefits: on the individual level, female care-oriented life courses are financially more secure in old age in the Beveridgean Dutch pension system.</p><p>We assumed that household incomes would not differ between West Germany and the Netherlands (Hypothesis 4). However, Fehler! Verweisquelle konnte nicht gefunden werden.C</p><p>shows a small but statistically significant country difference: For the 'homemakers' (Cluster 1) and the 'full-time employed mothers' (Cluster 3), household income levels are significantly higher in West Germany. This pattern suggests a type of "golden cage": West German women with a strong care orientation enjoy a higher standard of living in later life, yet they have less financial autonomy.</p><p>Crucially, this advantage depends on the presence of a spouse with a male-breadwinner pension. There are two possible explanations for the higher household income in West Germany. First, household income shows greater variance there (Appendix Figure <ref type="figure">A6</ref>). The higher predicted values are thus driven by a larger number of households with very high incomes. This interpretation is supported by the finding that, once we use the log of household equivalence income, the difference is no longer significant (Appendix Figure <ref type="figure">A8</ref>). Second, household income is not limited to pensions but also includes earnings from employment. Such earnings were more common in West Germany, as indicated by the higher share of women who worked in the four weeks prior to the interview (see Appendix Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">A3</ref> and<ref type="table" target="#tab_3">A4</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Sensitivity of results</head><p>We conducted several sensitivity analyses. First, we applied a log transformation to the three outcome variables instead of top-coding them. This increased country differences for pensions and decreased them for household income, slightly affecting the significance of some country coefficients. Our main finding-the higher individual-level security in the Netherlands-remained robust (Appendix Figure <ref type="figure">A8</ref>). Second, although education is endogenous to our work-family clusters and was therefore excluded from the main models, we tested its inclusion given substantial cross-country variation ( Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>). As expected, education mediated part of the cluster effects, reflecting educational differences across clusters (Appendix Figure <ref type="figure">A9</ref>). Third, we included a control for widowhood at the time of the interview to account for age-related variation in pension reporting across clusters. Its inclusion did not meaningfully alter the results (Appendix Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">A10</ref>). Finally, to account for slightly higher rates of non-partner cohabitation in West Germany, we added a control for living arrangements in the household income models. This adjustment also had no substantial impact on the findings (Appendix Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">A11</ref>). Overall, the sensitivity analyses support the robustness of our findings and do not invalidate our interpretations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Conclusion and Discussion</head><p>In this study, we investigated which pension policies most effectively secure women's financial autonomy and living standards in later life in conservative welfare states. Specifically, we used the comparison of West Germany and the Netherlands to assess how similar care-oriented work-family life courses are associated with three distinct measures of financial security in later life. Overall, individual independent pensions, our indicator for financial autonomy, differed most across countries compared to derived pensions and household income. The more universalistic Beveridgean Dutch pension system grants women with care-oriented life courses higher financial autonomy and thereby also higher basic financial security compared to the Bismarckian German system. West German women with a strong care orientation experience some compensation through survivors' benefits, although this only marginally reduced their gap to more employment-oriented life course clusters or to their Dutch peers. Furthermore, we found that women with atypical family life courses are better off in financial terms based on their individual pensions in the Netherlands. In terms of household income, the predicted values for West German clusters exceeded those for the Netherlands. This difference indicates that while women do better in terms of independent pension in the Netherlands, the household level reveals a more complex story.</p><p>Focusing on conservative welfare state settings, our study contributes to our understanding of the relationship between pension policy and the financial well-being of women in later life. Systems like the Dutch one, with a (nearly) universal basic pension and widespread occupational pension, have been shown to benefit women and those with atypical employment trajectories more generally (Dotti <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Sani &amp; Luppi, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Möhring, 2021)</ref>. Using an in-depth analysis of two conservative welfare states, our study expands upon these findings by differentiating between individual and derived pensions as well as household income. Going beyond previous findings, we find that higher individual pensions in the Netherlands do not translate to the household level. This findings demonstrates that householdlevel financial well-being in later life follows a different logic and deserves separate attention, as was suggested by one large-N study <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Möhring, 2021)</ref> and one study comparing Switzerland and Germany <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Madero-Cabib &amp; Fasang, 2016)</ref> as well as several studies with a focus on Germany <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Mika et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Weiland &amp; Möhring, 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Our study has several limitations. First, despite including the individual and the household level, we disregard personal wealth and home ownership as a measure of financial well-being in later life. Second, our investigation of survivor benefits should be understood as a glimpse rather than an in-depth analysis of the consequences of widowhood and the effects of different survivor benefit regulations, because few women in our sample were widowed at the time of the interview. Comparing the effects of survivor benefit regulations requires a more in-depth approach (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">van Winkle et al., 2024)</ref>. Lastly, our analysis showed considerably higher household equivalence income in West Germany, which we could begin to understand through the spread of outcome variables and the higher employment rates in West Germany. However, more investigation on the ways in which pension policies affect households, rather than individuals, is needed to understand these country differences.</p><p>Our findings have two key implications. First, as previous research has shown, privatization alone is not a sufficient predictor of pension inequalities (Dotti <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Sani &amp; Luppi, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Frericks, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Möhring, 2015</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Möhring, , 2018))</ref>. Instead, the structure of the public pension system, whether it is universal or tied to employment and earnings-which continues to operate alongside private and occupational pension plans-plays a crucial role in securing independent pensions for individuals with atypical employment histories, often women. Our results reinforce these findings, underscoring the need for a robust basic pension that goes beyond minimum social assistance, particularly in the context of growing privatization and increasing family diversity in later life, as seen in Germany in recent decades.</p><p>Second, our findings emphasize the need for a comprehensive approach to financial security in later life that considers the various income sources available to women. Comparing the two countries reveals different strategies for addressing the financial needs of older women. The Netherlands takes a more individualized approach, while West Germany focuses more on supporting widowed women and households. As a result, individual pensions, both independent and derived, are more stratified in West Germany. At the same time, the higher household incomes of West German women suggest that lower individual pension entitlements do not necessarily lead to income poverty at the household level, as long as they remain with a bread-winning spouse. Still, West German women more so than Dutch women seem to be "a husband away from poverty" <ref type="bibr">(Orloff, 1993, p.319</ref>): Their income structure in later life implies greater dependency on marital status and household composition. Due to demographic trends towards more atypical family life courses <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Kiernan, 2001)</ref> and growing pension privatization in Germany, a generous public baseline securing an independent income, such as in the Netherlands, will become more important to protect individuals from old-age poverty risks and provide an ageing in dignity for the majority of the elderly.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Comparative Design for West Germany and the Netherlands</figDesc></figure>
