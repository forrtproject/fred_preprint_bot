<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Science requires objective measurements to be able to falsify predictions, whereas consciousness is thought to be intrinsically personal and subjective. Consequently, behavioral measures of consciousness are often designated as "objective" or "subjective". Surprisingly however, the exact meaning of the terms objective and subjective is typically not clearly defined. Moreover, applying this label to a given behavioral measure is misleading, as the same measure can often be analyzed within a "subjective" or "objective" framework. Thus, the objective-subjective designation is not only relevant to the measure that is used, but to several other dimensions as well. In this chapter we provide a brief overview of dichotomies along which one might conceptualize the diJerence between objective and subjective approaches, such as the empirico-analytical method (manipulation vs trial-by-trial sorting), the mode of stimulus presentation (forced-choice vs nonforced-choice), the response type (Type 1 vs Type 2), and the adoption of a ground truth when computing the outcome measure (performance vs appearance). Although these dichotomies often overlap, the correspondence between them is typically only partial. Problems and pitfalls are discussed. Finally, advice is formulated to always explicitly outline how one's stimulus presentation, task, response measure, and analysis approach score on these dichotomies, requiring further explicit justification when claiming to capture "consciousness" as a construct.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Intro</head><p>It is diJicult to say when the scientific study of consciousness started. Some may align this with the foundation of the first psychophysics labs, as the first experimental psychologists set out to determine the relationship between physical stimulation and mental experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Others may set it at the second half of the 20th century with the advent of research on patients that show dissociations between conscious and unconscious processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Still others may place it in the early nineties of the 20th century, when an explicit research program for identifying the neural correlates of consciousness was put forward <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Regardless of one's view, a common denominator has been the need to experimentally establish whether an observer has a conscious experience of a stimulus or not.</p><p>This need can come in various forms, depending on the research program. The dominant experimental approach has been to follow a variation of standard methodology in cognitive (neuro)science. In this approach, one isolates some process that is relevant to the phenomenon one wants to understand by isolating the diJerence between two conditions that only diJer in the relevant aspect, but which are otherwise identical <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. In consciousness science this method has been branded "contrastive analysis" <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. For example, in research on perceptual awareness, one attempts to contrast the processes involved in consciously perceiving a stimulus with the processes that occur when the stimulus remains unconscious. Conscious and unconscious conditions can be experimentally established in many ways <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> , such as masking <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, the attentional blink <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>, continuous flash suppression <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>, binocular rivalry / dichoptic fusion <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> and so forth.</p><p>To isolate behaviors or processes that are thought to reflect consciousness, an "unconscious condition" is subtracted from a "conscious condition" <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref>. Importantly, to be meaningful this approach requires that there is some residual processing even in the unconscious condition, or else the procedure does not isolate anything that is unique to consciousness. To establish unconscious processing in the unconscious condition, an awareness measure needs to demonstrate that an observer has zero awareness of a stimulus, also called the zero-awareness criterion <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. Having established that a person is unaware of the stimulus, the researcher determines the degree to which there is residual processing through a secondary behavioral <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, physiological <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> or neural processing measure <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. An alternative approach involves establishing 'relative' unconscious processing. One approach is to demonstrate that residual unconscious processing exceeds awareness when both measures are compared directly on the same scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. Another approach is to match conditions in terms of objective performance and test whether they diJer on a secondary measure <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. In these approaches awareness does not have to be zero, but merely smaller than in a second condition <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, but see <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>.</p><p>All these approaches require a measurement tool that reflects the relationship between physical stimulation and what is consciously experienced. This was also what the first experimental psychologists tasked themselves with when they started the field of psychophysics. The field of psychophysics has given rise to a large toolbox of procedures and measurement approaches that allow one to determine the relationship between stimuli (physical input) and the sensations and perceptions they produce (mental phenomena) <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. In today's consciousness research, specific measurement tools reflect a specific amalgam of the studied aspect of consciousness (e.g., awareness of presence of a stimulus vs subjective experience of its spatial orientation), the observer's task (e.g., detecting a stimulus vs indicating one's confidence in one's orientation judgment), and analysis choices (e.g., average performance calculated over many trials vs sorting individual trials into "conscious" and "unconscious" categories). Interestingly, choice preferences for diJerent measurement approaches vary substantially across the community of consciousness researchers <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>. Given that the results of empirical research on the constituents of consciousness depend on the specific measurement approach, it is important to contextualize results by providing rationale for and being explicit about the selected approach, using consistent terminology.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Characterizing approaches: objective vs subjective</head><p>In the contrastive approach, empirical results on the constituents of consciousness depend on the measurement approach used to establish the contrasted conscious and unconscious conditions. An important distinction is between "objective" and "subjective" approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>. Importantly however, "objective" and "subjective" are loosely defined terms and can mean diJerent things to diJerent people and their meaning may depend on context. In consciousness research, objective approaches often refer to measurement strategies in which questions are asked that can be evaluated in terms of performance, i.e. questions that impose a ground truth against which the responses of the observer are evaluated. Subjective approaches on the other hand typically refer to strategies that gauge subjective experiences that are intrinsic/personal to the observer and thus cannot be falsified or evaluated in terms of a ground truth, i.e. for which the report of the observer is accepted as-is. However, this characterization is not watertight and can be open to interpretation. Although these terms are often used to characterize diJerent measures of consciousness (i.e. response measures, such as giving a yes/no response or a confidence response), their meaning encompasses much more, just as the operationalization of consciousness as a construct involves much more than just using one or the other measure <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. Thus, at a high level the terms can be used to indicate that consciousness is operationalized in a certain way on theoretical grounds (e.g., objective: evaluating responses against a ground truth, subjective: reported phenomenology), but at a lower level they can mean that a certain task and/or stimulus presentation mode is used (e.g., objective: forced-choice between two stimuli, subjective: nonforced-choice), that a certain response measure is used (e.g. objective: reporting presence or absence, subjective: reporting how strong the experience of a stimulus is), or that a certain analysis approach is adopted (e.g., objective: average performance across trials, subjective: trial sorting). Although these aspects are often interrelated, the terms objective and subjective may refer to any specific combination of construct, task, mode of presentation, response measure and analysis approach (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). To help navigate the plethora of awareness measures and measurement approaches, we outline several dichotomies in the sections below that often come up in consciousness research and relate these to the objective vs subjective distinction. Notably, the validity of none of the operationalizations of consciousness has been firmly established, partially because there is no agreed upon theoretical grounding to support such a validation <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 1.</head><p>Taxonomizing approaches in the study of consciousness. The terms objective and subjective may refer to any specific combination of task, mode of presentation, response measure, analysis approach and outcome measure.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis approaches: performance vs trial-by-trial sorting</head><p>Before treating dichotomies related to task, stimulus presentation and response, we first characterize the two main analysis approaches. The common distinction between objective, falsifiable performance metrics vs. subjective, non-falsifiable subjective reports illustrates how tasks and analysis choices are closely intertwined. In what is typically referred to as objective approaches, an experimental manipulation (e.g., strong vs weak masking) is used to create an "unconscious" condition where performance, calculated across all trials of this condition, is around chance level, and a "conscious" condition where average performance is high. Thus, objective, performance-based tasks are analyzed by calculating summary statistics reflecting behavioral performance across many trials of an unconscious and conscious condition, respectively. In contrast, in what we refer to as subjective approaches, an experimental manipulation is often titrated (e.g., masking of intermediate strength) so that an observer reports conscious experience in some trials but no conscious experience in other trials. These subjective reports are subsequently used to sort trials into "conscious" and "unconscious" categories. In other words, objective approaches manipulate consciousness directly (consciousness being an independent variable), whereas subjective approaches use consciousness as a dependent variable, dependent on an observer's non-falsifiable introspective report (see Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>). Note that response metrics can often be used for both purposes, and approaches are sometimes even combined. It can be hard for nonexperimentally trained readers to see the diJerence, but it is important to realize these approaches are fundamentally diJerent, and that each has its own set of theoretical and methodological problems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 2.</head><p>Illustration of diBerent analysis approaches and their eBects. In the objective approach, consciousness is manipulated using techniques such as masking, the AB, or CFS. This leads to a Subjective / Objective</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mode of presentation</head><p>Response measure Analysis approach Outcome measure Task conscious condition, in which performance (e.g., expressed as d') is high and an unconscious condition in which performance is low and/or (close to) at chance level. In the subjective approach, consciousness is not manipulated but trials are sorted based on a subjective response of the observer about stimulus perceptibility (e.g., seen vs. unseen). Often performance is titrated to be around 75% correct to have suBicient trials in both post-hoc created conditions. Mode of stimulus presentation: Forced-choice vs Nonforced-choice Some may refer to objective as forced-choice and subjective as non-forced choice. Although the term forced-choice is commonplace in the literature, its precise meaning is seldom made explicit, and thus the label is used inconsistently. In the classic psychophysics framework of signal detection theory (SDT), forced-choice refers to tasks in which an observer chooses from two or more stimuli presented on every trial, while nonforced-choice refers to tasks in which the participant evaluates only a single stimulus per trial (see Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>. Another meaning often adopted in consciousness research is that a participant has two (or more) response options to choose from after seeing a single stimulus, especially when applied to discrimination tasks. Under that definition, virtually any empirical study would be "forced choice", given that in almost any study participants respond using a limited set of options, thus stripping the term of its meaning. We therefore recommend using the designation "forced-choice" only for tasks in which a participant chooses from a limited set of stimuli presented on every trial. Thus, "two alternative forced choice" means that a participant is presented two stimuli on every trial (for example on the left and on the right side of the screen) and makes a forced choice to indicate whether the left or the right stimulus is the pre-defined target. The temporal version of the 2AFC is the two-interval forced choice (2IFC) in which two stimuli are presented in succession, and the participant indicates whether the target was present in the first or in the second interval (see Figure <ref type="figure">3a</ref>).</p><p>Using the term forced-choice to refer to the number of stimuli presented on every trial is important because only when defined in this way can a forced-choice task considered to be "criterionfree" (when performance is evaluated over all trials), whereas a non-forced choice task is intrinsically susceptible to the observer's response criterion, as we discuss in the next paragraph. In a non-forced choice task, such as the "yes/no" task, only a single stimulus, which might either contain the target or not, is presented on every trial, while a pre-defined number of response options is available to respond to this stimulus (see Figure <ref type="figure">3b</ref>). Although the distinction between forced-choice and nonforced-choice is sometimes thought to map onto the subjective-objective dimension, neither of these tasks can be said to be inherently "objective" or "subjective." Importantly, the classification as objective or subjective also depends on how data from these tasks are analyzed, e.g. whether performance across all trials is evaluated against a ground truth (objective), or whether individual trials are sorted into conscious vs unconscious conditions and/or used to indicate a shift in the point of subjective equality (subjective). For example, a yes/no task in which an observer indicates target presence vs absence would yield a subjective measure when trials are sorted according to the observer's response, but the same task would yield an objective measure when a summary statistic reflecting the observer's ability to distinguish between target presence vs absence is calculated across many trials.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 3. (a)</head><p>In forced-choice tasks the observer chooses from two or more stimuli presented on every trial. For example, in the 2AFC task illustrated here, two stimuli are presented on every trial, one containing the target and one without the target. The observer must indicate which of these stimuli contained the target, the left or the right portion of the screen (thus being able to directly compare both sides). In the 2IFC task illustrated here, the observer indicates whether the target is presented in the first or second interval. (b) In nonforced-choice tasks, the observer only evaluates a single stimulus on every trial. In the yes/no task illustrated here, trials either contain a target or not and the observer indicates presence (yes response) or absence (no response).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Criterion-free vs criterion-dependent</head><p>Some might also choose to refer to objective as "criterion-free" and subjective as "criterion-dependent". This dichotomy maps onto the degree to which a measure can be influenced by criterion shifts / biases, which depends on the nature of the task and the way the data are analyzed. Forced-choice tasks such as the 2AFC/2IFC task are considered criterion-free because the participant does not need to maintain an internal criterion to perform the task. Rather, the participant can concurrently evaluate both stimuli and use the diJerence between the two as a natural criterion to choose between left and right or between the first and the second interval. Thus criterion-free does not mean that no criterion is involved, but rather that the criterion is likely to be neutral with respect to the relevant stimulus dimension. Thus, criterionfree in this context refers to the fact that the observer is not likely to exhibit a bias for one stimulus category over the other. Importantly, this does not preclude a bias for the first or the second interval (2IFC), or for left and right (2AFC). Such biases might always occur and cannot be prevented, but they would not impact the prior probability of designating stimuli as either one or the other stimulus category in a 2AFC/2IFC, because a biased preference for a location or interval is orthogonal to the relevant stimulus dimension. In contrast, in the yes/no task the observer needs to set and maintain a criterion throughout the task for deciding whether the single presented stimulus contained the target or not, and in such a task there is no natural criterion that can be adopted to make a choice. Rather, the observer must arbitrarily decide which signal strengths count as noise (target absent) and which ones count as signal (target present), thus becoming a criterion-dependent choice.</p><p>In consciousness research it is commonplace to use responses on a criterion-dependent yes/no task to sort individual trials into categories reflecting the degree of conscious experience, either based on a simple seen-unseen response, or using a more fine-grained measures like the Perceptual Awareness Scale (PAS) or a confidence evaluation, as discussed further down <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>. This seems to naturally and intuitively allow participants to express their subjective experience, potentially even incorporating diJerent criteria when using more fine-grained response options. However, it also means that the observer's criterion for any given response eJectively marks a discrete boundary between conditions yes/no etc. trial 1 trial 4 trial 3 trial 2 2IFC "yes" "yes" "yes" "no" "1st" "1st" "1st" "2nd" 2AFC "left" "left" "left" "right" a.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>b.</head><p>such as "unconscious" and "conscious". Unfortunately, this boundary is known to be easily confounded by internal and external factors that may not reflect changes in subjective experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38]</ref>.</p><p>As a potential solution to the criterion problem, one may collect yes/no responses across a series of trials containing targets and non-targets to separate out the influence of the criterion. Using this approach, the arbitrary response criterion can be estimated independently from the observer's objective ability (sensitivity) to distinguish between target presence and absence, for example by applying signal detection theory to calculate d' (sensitivity) and the criterion (SDT, see Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>). In this analysis approach, sensitivity can be said to represent an objective, criterion-free awareness measure derived from a yes/no task. Indeed, using SDT sensitivities from 2AFC (or 2IFC) tasks can be directly related to sensitivities from yes/no tasks. Alternative approaches involve computing criterion-free metacognitive metrics to estimate the degree of metacognitive eJiciency of an observer (see Type 1 vs Type 2 section below) <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>.</p><p>Although it might seem appealing to adopt such a criterion-free approach, either by using forcedchoice stimulus-presentations and/or by computing criterion-free performance metrics such as d', the disadvantage is that these inescapably require the researcher to set a ground truth, which may disregard the observer's actual phenomenology <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 4. Illustration of criterion shifts in the SDT framework. Internal signal strength is plotted for noiseonly trials (left distribution) and signal + noise trials (right distribution). d' reflects the distance between the means of the distributions (how well an observer can distinguish between signal and noise). The observer must set an internal criterion (red vertical line) to indicate whether a stimulus was present or</head><p>not. This criterion can be liberal (more to the left), leading to more "seen" responses (when the internal signal strength is relatively weak), or the criterion can be conservative (more to the right), leading to less "seen" responses (only when the internal signal strength is relatively strong). Thus, the designation "seen" or "unseen" arbitrarily depends on the criterion that is adopted by the observer.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Response types: Type 1 vs Type 2</head><p>Another dichotomy that often comes up in consciousness research and that is often mapped onto objective and subjective is the distinction between Type 1 and Type 2 responses. Type 1 responses are first-order judgments about stimuli, such as detecting or categorizing a stimulus (e.g., in a 2AFC or yes/no task), whereas Type 2 responses are second-order judgments on a Type 1 response, involving reflection on one's own percepts, cognitive processes or a confidence in one's own judgments <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>. A primary diJerence between the two is the notion that Type 2 decisions involve some metacognitive judgment about a Type 1 response. An alternative definition for a Type 2 decision that is sometimes adopted is that it involves any decision for which the correctness cannot be evaluated on objective grounds [e.g. see <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">57]</ref>. This is arguably a slightly more inclusive definition than one that involves the presence of a metacognitive judgement. Consequently, one might debate about whether a certain measure is a 'true' Type 2 measure or not depending on which exact definition of Type 2 one adopts.</p><p>Typical examples of Type 2 measures that can be used in consciousness research are postdecision wagering, confidence measures and the Perceptual Awareness Scale (PAS) (as compared in <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref>). In post-decision wagering, observers place a bet on the correctness of their decision, thereby revealing whether their decision was informed by consciously available information <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref>, but see <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref> . Similarly, confidence responses reflect how much confidence observers place in their decision, typically without a monetary incentive for doing so <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>, but see <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref>. In the PAS, observers indicate the strength of their percept using a four-point scale (e.g. 'No experience', 'Brief glimpse', 'Almost clear experience', 'Clear experience'), reflecting an assessment of the degree of clearness of their percept, rather than a direct detection of the stimulus itself <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref>.</p><p>Type 1 and Type 2 responses can either be executed sequentially (see example in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">5A</ref>), or concurrently (see example in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">5B</ref>). The advantage of the concurrent response is that the second order judgement is not based on an evidence accumulation process that may have continued after giving the Type 1 response, which could create a potential mismatch between the two <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">64]</ref>. As discussed in the previous paragraphs, Type 1 responses can either be considered objective or subjective, depending on whether they analyzed within an objective or subjective framework (i.e. whether these responses are evaluated against a ground truth or whether they are sorted into categories as-is). Similarly, when considering the Type 2 response in isolation, it yields a subjective measure because it cannot be evaluated on correctness (there is no "right" or "wrong") <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">65,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">66]</ref>. Thus, when confidence judgments are used to sort individual trials into conscious (high confidence) and unconscious (low confidence) conditions, or when trials with certain confidence levels are matched against each other, its use is essentially subjective, because without a ground truth the observer's subjective response criterion cannot be distinguished from objective performance (sensitivity). judgements about stimuli (e.g., presence/absence) and can be correct or incorrect. Type 2 responses can either be defined as reflecting a metacognitive judgement about a Type 1 response (e.g., confidence in its correctness) or be thought of as responses reflecting the subjective experience of a stimulus, so that the correctness of the response cannot be evaluated on objective grounds (as it reflects subjective experience). When combined in a task, Type 1 and Type 2 responses can be given (a) separately, i.e. serially or (b) concurrently, e.g. see <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref> .</p><p>However, by evaluating the relationship between Type 2 responses such as confidence and Type 1 accuracy, one can calculate metacognitive measures that potentially disentangle metacognitive sensitivity from an observer's criterion. Such measures of metacognitive sensitivity introduce a ground truth against which the Type 2 response are evaluated: trials with correct Type 1 responses and high confidence are considered "correct", whereas trials with incorrect Type 1 responses and low confidence are considered "incorrect." Metacognitive sensitivity thus reflects how well an observer's Type 2 responses distinguish between an observer's own correct and incorrect Type 1 responses. However, in its initial inception this metric was known to be aJected by Type 1 sensitivity, response bias and confidence bias, prompting the development of the meta-d' model. This measure of metacognitive sensitivity potentially corrects for these confounds <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>.</p><p>The meta-d' model was subsequently further extended by computing the ratio between meta-d' and d', an outcome metric of the metacognitive eJiciency by which an observer converts their first order ability into confidence responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">68]</ref>. Calculated as a summary statistic over a series of trials, measures of metacognitive sensitivity and metacognitive eJiciency can be said to have a hybrid objective-subjective nature. By analyzing participants' introspective insight into their own performance, a "subjective" aspect of consciousness is studied. At the same time, by considering these insights to be "correct" or "incorrect", the response is evaluated "objectively" against a ground truth. Therefore, it is important to realize that a given response metric such as confidence can be considered subjective when considered in isolation (there is no intrinsic ground truth against which it can be compared), but as soon as a metric based on this measure utilizes a ground truth to evaluate it, the outcome metric carries the hallmarks of the objective approach. Thus, response measures like post-decision wagering, confidence, or even the PAS can be converted into outcome metrics that are not purely subjective.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Performance vs Appearance</head><p>A final dichotomy related to the objective vs subjective distinction is that of performance vs appearance. As discussed above, performance reflects how good one is at a task relative to a ground truth, whereas appearance reflects the perceived magnitude of some stimulus dimension. Examples of appearance measures are those in which an observer indicates the strength of their percept, as in the PAS <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref>, those in which one either indicates which of two stimuli is perceived as stronger in some dimension, such as brightness <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref>, or one which one reproduces a stimulus dimension <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[70,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">71]</ref>, see Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref>. These examples also illustrate the tension between what constitutes a subjective "measure" and what constitutes an objective "measure". When responses on a reproduction task are considered regardless of how they relate to the presented stimulus, the approach is best characterized as subjective; but when reproduction accuracy is evaluated with reference to the presented stimulus, the approach is best characterized as objective. Thus, even an intrinsically subjective scale like the PAS can be used within an objective framework by incorporating an external ground truth into the analysis, even though this is not how it was originally intended to be used. Similar intricacies arise when considering a forced-choice decision between two alternatives based on the subjective appearance of a stimulus. Although such a 2AFC decision may be regarded as criterion-free, and although responses could be analyzed across a series of trials, it can also be used in a subjective framework if one abolishes the use of "correct" or "incorrect" answers during analysis.</p></div>

In Table <ref type="table">1</ref>, we provide a selective overview of tasks, modes of presentation, response measures, analysis choices, and outcome measures, which we relate to the abovementioned dichotomies, as well as the core objective/subjective distinction. This table is far from complete.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Characterizing tasks: detection vs discrimination</head><p>A not yet discussed distinction that is often made in consciousness science is between detection tasks (detect presence vs. absence of one specific target stimulus) and discrimination or categorization tasks (discriminate between several possible target stimuli), also see Table <ref type="table">1</ref>. Detection and discrimination can both be measured using forced-choice tasks or nonforced-choice tasks such as yes/no tasks. For example, a forced-choice detection task may present a target in the first interval, and "nothing" (noise) in the second interval (Figure <ref type="figure">3a</ref>). A more common task is the nonforced-choice yes/no detection task, where a target is present or absent in a single observation interval (see 7a, top row). Similarly, discrimination is often assessed with a nonforced-choice yes/no task, for example by presenting either a left-or a right-tilted stimulus (see Figure <ref type="figure">7a</ref>, bottom row). Note again that single stimulus discrimination tasks are often incorrectly labeled forced-choice, even though they only contain a single stimulus. Indeed, in psychophysics, the terms detection and discrimination are often considered interchangeable, as detection can be seen as a variant of discrimination in which one has to discriminate between target and non-target (noise). However, an important diJerence between the two is that in detection tasks the observer must accumulate evidence for absence in target absent trials. Despite the superficial similarity in task design, the brain tackles this problem diJerently from accumulating evidence for one of two alternatives <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[72]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[73]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[74]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[75]</ref>. Relatedly, detection tasks have an asymmetrical confusion matrix and are naturally prone to bias, whereas discrimination tasks have a symmetrical confusion matrix and are naturally less prone (but not immune) to bias (see Figure <ref type="figure">7b</ref>). Traditionally, consciousness science has put a lot of emphasis on the distinction between detection and discrimination when contrasting conscious vs unconscious processing. Detection is often thought to have a more direct relation to consciousness than discrimination. When measured subjectively, a stimulus is considered conscious when it is "detected", i.e., given a "present" label by the observer. Detection appears consistent with our intuitions about perceptual awareness: when we are conscious of a stimulus, we can report its presence. When we fail to report the presence of any visual stimulus, we are considered blind. Accordingly, the phenomenon of "blindsight" involves demonstrating that patients with visual cortex lesions fail to report the presence of stimuli in their defective portions of the visual field (this is the "blind" part of the phenomenon), while still being able to discriminate some aspect of the stimulus with above-chance accuracy (this is the "sight" part of the phenomenon).</p><p>However, when detection and discrimination are compared as in the case of blindsight, detection is a criterion-dependent subjective measure involving sorting of trials into "conscious" and "unconscious" categories, while discrimination is an objective (and often criterion-free) measure calculated across all "unconscious" trials. Dissociations between these measures may therefore reflect the fact that subjective thresholds are substantially higher than objective thresholds (resulting in the objective discrimination measure having higher sensitivity than the subjective detection measure), as well as their diJerential susceptibility to criterion eJects. A convincing demonstration of blindsight would need to show that discrimination exceeds detection when detection is at chance and both tasks are measured using comparable approaches (e.g. forced-choice, no correlation between detection and discrimination, criterion-free) <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[76,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">77]</ref>. There seem to be few studies that attempt to achieve this, and those that do typically find no proof of blindsight, at least in normal subjects <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[78]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[79]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[80]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 7. Illustration of the diBerence between detection and discrimination. (a) In detection (top row), some trials contain a stimulus, whereas others do not. In discrimination (bottom row), every trial contains a stimulus, and the task is to detect a certain feature like location or orientation (CW: clockwise oriented or CCW: counterclockwise oriented). Note that a nonforced-choice discrimination task like the one depicted here can also be thought of as a yes/no task in which the participant has to detect a certain feature like clockwise orientation (press "CW" if present, press "CCW" if absent). (b) Nevertheless, the two tasks have diBerent confusion matrices, stimulus detection being asymmetrical and discrimination being symmetrical.</head><p>Interestingly, above-chance discrimination is sometimes used as a measure of unconscious processing -as in the case of blindsight -but sometimes also used to evaluate consciousness. While the mapping of detection on consciousness appears well aligned with a folk psychological understanding of consciousness, in many cases the goal is to measure awareness of a particular stimulus property like location, orientation, color, shape, motion direction, emotion, object category, and so on. For example, when measuring the extent to which a secondary measure of residual unconscious processing (e.g., fMRI response in visual cortex) is influenced by a specific stimulus property (e.g., images of faces vs houses), the awareness measure should capture that particular stimulus property, and this typically requires a discrimination task (e.g., discrimination of faces vs houses) <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> . While chance-level discrimination performance is generally seen as evidence that awareness of the to-be-discriminated stimulus property was absent, associating awareness with above-chance discriminability is controversial, even when performance is close to 100% correct, as in certain cases of blindsight. However, one may argue that when evaluating conscious experience, we tend to categorize specific contents relative to other potential contents, which may be considered more discrimination-than detection-like. Given these divergent perspectives, it is important for researchers to make explicit their assumptions and logic for implementing diJerent tasks to quantify conscious vs unconscious processing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Problems and pitfalls</head><p>In this chapter, we outlined several dichotomies that overlap with the objective-subjective distinction in diJerent ways. An important point is that measuring consciousness involves a cascade of decisions that impact the outcome and conclusion of a study. Thus, measuring consciousness is more complicated than simply choosing an "objective" or "subjective" measure. Rather, the high-level choice to operationalize consciousness within a certain framework impacts the task, the way in which one presents stimuli, the response measure, the analysis approach, the outcome measure, all of which together have a large impact on the outcome and conclusions of a study. Consequently, one might think that it should be obvious whether a certain experiment has adopted an objective or subjective framework, but a complicating factor is that superficially similar tasks, manipulations and measures (like making a present-absent judgement) can be analyzed in fundamentally diJerent ways, using fundamentally diJerent assumptions, leading to fundamentally diJerent outcomes. Thus, what might look superficially similar might involve a very diJerent approach. The practice of combining approaches can add another layer of complexity, for example when computing performance metrics (objective framework) based on post-hoc sorted conditions (subjective framework) <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[81]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[82]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">[83]</ref>.</p><p>Nevertheless, it is also diJicult to claim with authority that one approach is intrinsically superior to another approach. Both approaches have their own problems associated with them. For example, using the contrastive approach within an objective framework typically involves experimentally creating conscious and unconscious conditions using experimental techniques. The advantage of this approach is that the researcher has experimental control, which is the bedrock of scientific inquiry. However, critics may point out that these techniques also introduce a diJerence between conditions by either changing the physical stimulation (e.g. masking, the attentional blink, CFS) or by directly interfering with neural processing (e.g. using TMS). As a result, some may question whether the diJerence that was introduced isolates the relevant diJerence between conscious and unconscious processing. For example, one may ask whether the observed diJerence between weakly and strongly masked stimuli indeed uncovers the diJerence between conscious and unconscious processing, or whether the diJerence in physical stimulation instead represents a confound rather than an explanation for the observed changes in conscious experience.</p><p>Relatedly, the objective approach requires setting a ground truth for which responses are "correct", and which are "incorrect". This disregards the fact that consciousness is about the subjective experience of the observer, so that in fact there is no ground truth to be had other than what the observer experiences <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>. To give some examples, an observer may experience stimuli as larger (Ebbinghaus illusion), longer (Ponzo and Müller-Lyer illusion) <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[70,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">84]</ref>, brighter <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref>, bouncing <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[85]</ref>, multiplying <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">[86]</ref> and so forth due to contextual influences and/or due to influences intrinsic to the participant. These may diverge from the physical characteristics of those stimuli when measured using the "ground truth" that the experimenter chooses to adopt. Thus, when analyzing the data in an objective SDT framework, the response of the participant may express itself as a "bias" (criterion shift), but this bias could either reflect a "true" perceptual shift, but it could also reflect a non-perceptual bias that has no eJect on conscious experience. Objective frameworks are not able to resolve such ambiguities because they -by their nature -require setting a ground truth, and these frameworks cannot disentangle whether a behavioral departure from the experimenter's ground truth is due to perceptual or non-perceptual reasons <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[70,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">84]</ref>.</p><p>The subjective approach has its advantages and disadvantages too. It aims to take experience of the observer seriously by letting go of a ground truth, and thus by letting the response of the observer take center stage. It tackles the potentially confounding influence of physical stimulation by taking the response of the participant as a starting point to create conditions. As a side note, it may be somewhat confusing that in a subjective approach too, researchers often manipulate consciousness using methods like masking, the attentional blink and CFS. However, rather than using this manipulation to create experimental conditions, the manipulation is used to titrate performance to a fixed level somewhere between chance and perfect<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> . Once this is achieved, physical stimulation can be kept identical, and the responses of the participant can be used to sort trials into conscious and unconscious conditions. An advantage of this approach is that diJerences in stimulation cannot themselves be a source of confounds. However, the experimental control that researchers maintain in the objective approach is now handed over to the participant, who through response selection determines to which condition a given trial belongs. Consequently, the potential source of confounds no longer comes from diJerences in physical stimulation, but rather from the response of the participant itself. For example, a well-known confound is that the response of the participant does not just reflect the experience of the observer but may also reflect a plethora of non-perceptual influences. This has been shown to confound neural measures of consciousness based on trial sorting, both on theoretical and on empirical grounds <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">8</ref>). Consequently, the number of seen and unseen trials (or the awareness judgements on the PAS) changes as a factor of this criterion manipulation (while d' remained similar). Note that the average signal strength of both unseen and seen trials is greater under a conservative response criterion than under a liberal response criterion (see also <ref type="bibr">Fig 4)</ref>. When criterion shifts are combined with post-hoc sorting of trials based on visibility (e.g., seen vs. unseen), this aBected the decoding accuracy of the second and third neural events, but not the first neural event. In combination with simulations (data not shown), these results revealed that the neural correlate associated perceptual awareness is aBected by criterion confounds, threatening the validity of using contrastive approaches (e.g., seen vs unseen) based on (criterion sensitive) subjective measures to reveal the neural correlates of consciousness (reproduced with permission from <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, published under a CC BY 4.0 license). This is problematic, because criterion shifts can arise due to many factors, both internal and external to the observer. Internal factors might be endogenous attention, or the fact that participants are intrinsically conservative or liberal. External sources of variation across experiments may be contextual eJects such as the ratio of targets to non-targets, the perceived utility of certain response-outcome mappings, or the relative strength of the stimulus compared to other stimuli in close temporal proximity <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">67,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">70,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">87]</ref>. These factors and more are known to shift the response criterion, thereby confounding the outcome with aspects that are not related to subjective experience.</p><p>Furthermore, it has become increasingly clear that the choice of the overall framework strongly impacts the results one obtains. For example, the threshold marking the transition from unconscious to conscious conditions is typically substantially higher when measured subjectively, so that under subjective measurement approaches estimates of unconscious processing are greater, and the functional role of consciousness is diminished, compared to objective measurement approaches (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">9</ref>). Similarly, detection and discrimination approaches may naturally yield diJerent results, as detection tasks are naturally more prone to bias than discrimination tasks. Unfortunately, there is no gold standard for measuring consciousness, so that the measurement approach depends on the researcher's convictions and intuitions. Illustration of results from a study comparing subjective and objective analysis approaches. The results show that decoding of subjectively "invisible" categories in object selective areas (LOC, OFA/OPA, FFA/PPA) is much better than for objectively "invisible" categories, whereas for "visible" categories the reverse holds (reproduced with permission from <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, published under a CC BY 4.0 license). Some may see relief in the use of hybrid approaches, such as measures of metacognitive eJiciency across trials <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">88]</ref>. These may carry hallmarks from both subjective and objective measurement strategies, depending on how the outcome metric is computed. This can be seen as a strength, but also as a weakness. From a strength perspective, when the outcome metric of these approaches is computed over many trials, and if this computation successfully models or corrects for confounds related to first order performance as well as response and confidence biases, they could resolve some of the methodological issues that plague subjective and objective measures, while retaining a core aspect of the subjective approach by interrogating the experience of the observer. However, even state-of-the art metacognitive measures do not resolve all problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">89]</ref>. Thus, one might also argue the reverse, that despite their adoption of a subjective measure like confidence, hybrid outcome metrics like metacognitive eJiciency will always require a ground truth, which is inconsistent with the intrinsic nature of conscious experience. As such, the remaining problems in hybrid approaches may be a consequence of the fickle influence of projecting a ground truth in experiments that investigate subjective experience. Whatever approach one favors, the measurement and analysis strategy one adopts greatly influences the outcome and conclusions. Plausibly, this also partially explains the heterogeneity of results in the empirical literature and precludes drawing definitive conclusion based on the wealth of data that has already been collected. For this reason, we strongly advise that researchers are explicit about the approach that they prefer to adopt and provide a rationale for doing so. In addition, we hope that researchers are not just explicit about their general framework but also defend in more detail how these choices map onto the dichotomies that we put forward in this chapter (see Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). Although this step may not resolve the issues, it at least provides a starting point for having constructive discussions regarding the meaning and interpretation of empirical results.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 5 .</head><label>5</label><figDesc>Figure 5.
