<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Edible insects have been proposed as a sustainable future protein source for a growing global population. Overseas, interest has seen investment in start-up companies specialising in producing insects for human consumption. Yet little is known of the edible insect species in Aotearoa New Zealand or whether New Zealanders are willing to consume insects. To address this, I investigated the current landscape of edible insects in Aotearoa. I created a catalogue of species with traditional and contemporary uses, the companies that are producing insect-based products and the social and legislative landscape they exist in. I then explored the social licence for insects as food, using a questionnaire to examine the perceptions and experiences of 620 participants, finding an openness to insects as food, influenced by prior experience, knowledge, and a low food neophobia score. However, this was tempered by sentiment analysis showing insect ingredients were viewed more negatively than other food ingredients suggesting an unconscious bias. The huhu beetle, Prionoplus reticularis, was widely listed by participants as an edible insect in Aotearoa, suggesting a potential candidate for future farming. However, surprisingly little is known about the biology of this well-known beetle. To address this, I used GCMS to explore the metabolomic profile of this species along a latitudinal gradient. I found that a random forest model trained on this data was able to predict the geographic location of a larvae with reasonable accuracy, providing a possible tool to detect the provenance of edible insects in the future. I investigated the beetles' scramble competition mating system, and, using static allometry and flight mills, I found evidence of the interplay of sexual selection and stabilising selection on traits associated with male fitness in this species. I also found evidence of sexual dimorphism in the species, indicating the importance of female chemical cues to male mate searching. Using scanning electron microscopy, I investigated the antennal ultrastructure of male and female P. reticularis, describing unique, sexually dimorphic sensilla in this species. This thesis serves as a starting point for the development of edible insects in Aotearoa.</p><p>Firstly, I have to thank my wonderful supervisors, Greg Holwell, Leilani Walker and Thomas Buckley. Greg, you are a wonderful human being who exemplifies kindness, caring and empathy.</p><p>I really appreciate the support you have provided, whether it be through global pandemics or concussions, you make things work and I could not have done this thesis without you. The meetings, field trips and frequent discussion of '80s and '90s action movies have been a joy.</p><p>Leilani, you are one of the smartest people I know, and I really appreciated how you have challenged my thinking and I think that is reflected in my thesis. You switched between friend and supervisor hats with aplomb, and our trip to the Bishop Museum and karaoke in Hawaii was one of the highlights of my thesis. Thomas, I'm sorry I didn't get to work more with you, but I did enjoy our chats at Manaaki Whenua. I regret running out of time to explore the genomics of the huhu beetle, the pandemic has a few things to answer for and this was one of them.</p></div>

It's high protein, no fat, extreme nutrients, and they're just abundant, they're everywhere. But, no, we're not going to do that!"</p><p>There likely comes a point in every doctoral candidate's journey, where critically acclaimed, Academy Award winning actor, Nicolas Cage, summarises four years of their work in an offhand comment to Entertainment Weekly <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Collis, 2023)</ref>. Whilst insects do contain fat, Mr. Cage correctly points out the potential of edible insects to address concerns of protein supply as humanity's global population increases, but also acknowledges the perceived disgust and reticence of many cultures, but particularly in the west, to consume insects. However, it is not just Hollywood stars suggesting insects could be a solution to our food security concerns.</p><p>With the global population expected to reach 9 billion by 2050, the Food and Agriculture</p><p>Organisation of the United Nations (FAO) estimates that the global agricultural demand will increase by 50 percent of the demand in 2013 (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, 2017). In light of this challenge, there has been increased interest in the place of insects within the human diet. Entomophagy is already a common practice in many cultures, with over 1,500 recorded species of insects consumed globally <ref type="bibr" target="#b376">(Van Itterbeeck &amp; Pelozuelo, 2022)</ref> by several hundred-million people <ref type="bibr" target="#b371">(van Huis et al., 2022)</ref>. Globally, few insect species are reared commercially at an industrial scale for food, with the majority being wild harvested. The primary species reared commercially for human consumption are crickets (e.g. Acheta domestica, Gryllus bimaculatus, Teleogryllus commodus) and mealworms (e.g. Alphitobius diaperinus, Tenebrio molitor, Zophobas morio) <ref type="bibr" target="#b367">(van Huis, 2016)</ref>. However, interest in eating insects has only increased in western cultures over the past decade.</p><p>The production of insects can be achieved through wild-harvest, semi-domestication, or farming.</p><p>Wild harvesting has been practiced by humans for millennia and is particularly effective for gregarious species of insects allowing for efficient collection. The wild harvesting of insects can be practiced as a form of biocontrol for pest species in agriculture whilst supplementing protein in the diet. A successful example can be seen with Patanga succincta locusts which were a major agricultural pest in Thailand prior to a successful campaign to use them as food <ref type="bibr" target="#b160">(Hanboonsong, 2010)</ref>. Semi-domestication involves manipulating the environment to facilitate the rearing of insects for part of their lifecycle. For example, palm trees in some South-East Asian countries will be cut down to provide palm weevil breeding sites <ref type="bibr" target="#b403">(Yen, 2015)</ref>. Farming incorporates the entire lifecycle of the insect in an environmentally controlled environment with varying degrees of automation. Possibly the oldest example of farming insects is silk farming, which has been practiced for over 5000 years. Silk production was the primary objective here with the decocooned pupae a by-product that was used as food <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Cherry, 1987)</ref>.</p><p>The lower environmental impacts of rearing insects for food are often cited to increase the sustainability of our food production systems, compared to conventional sources of animal protein production <ref type="bibr" target="#b157">(Halloran et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b269">Oonincx et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b268">Oonincx &amp; de Boer, 2012)</ref>. Life cycle assessments, an analytical tool to assess the environmental impact of a product, suggest that land-use and greenhouse gas emissions of insect-rearing are lower than other forms of livestock <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Bosch et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b157">Halloran et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b262">Nikkhah et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b268">Oonincx &amp; de Boer, 2012)</ref>, however, this is dependent on the rearing methods used <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Bosch et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b268">Oonincx &amp; de Boer, 2012)</ref>. In comparison to traditional livestock, insects, which are poikilotherms, have a favourable food conversion ratio (FCR) with some species able to utilise low quality or non-traditional feedstocks that may otherwise be seen as a waste stream (e.g., some cerambycid larvae can consume forestry waste, mealworms can utilise vegetable scraps and brewer's yeast). The FCR (kg feed/kg of fresh weight) for mealworms is 2.2 which compares to 2.3 in poultry, 4.0 in swine, and 2.7 -8.8 in beef (depending on the feed used) <ref type="bibr" target="#b268">(Oonincx &amp; de Boer, 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Like other livestock, the rearing of insects also produces greenhouse gasses (GHGs) and waste comprised of exuviae (moulted insect skin) and frass (faeces and undigested substrate) which also produces GHGs. Insects, and their frass, produce much lower carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), methane (CH 4 ) and nitrous oxide (N 2 O) than cattle making them a more environmentally sustainable solution than conventional livestock <ref type="bibr" target="#b269">(Oonincx et al., 2010)</ref>. The production of ammonia (NH 3 ), which causes nitrification of waterways and indirectly N 2 O production, is also lower and, combined with the ability to utilise waste streams from other areas of primary production, the frass can be used in the agricultural system as a fertiliser enabling a circular economy <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">(Dicke, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b268">Oonincx &amp; de Boer, 2012)</ref>.</p><p>The land use to produce one kilogram of insect protein is considerably smaller than other forms of livestock (de Vries &amp; de Boer, 2010; <ref type="bibr" target="#b268">Oonincx &amp; de Boer, 2012</ref>) with production of one kilogram of mealworm protein requiring 43% and 10% of the land required to produce one kilogram of animal protein of dairy and beef respectively. This is due to the small size of the insect allowing for vertical farming, efficient conversion of feed, and their feed being derived from by-products rather than pasture <ref type="bibr" target="#b268">(Oonincx &amp; de Boer, 2012)</ref>. Similarly to land use, water use is also much lower for insect production with beef requiring five times the amount of water to produce the equivalent unit of mealworm protein (112 L/g to 23 L/g respectively) <ref type="bibr" target="#b245">(Miglietta et al., 2015)</ref>. Again, the high feed efficiency of mealworms is attributed to this small water footprint.</p><p>However, there are challenges associated with the use and development of insect-based food production. <ref type="bibr" target="#b402">Yen (2008)</ref> highlights the important role of conservation and traditional ecological knowledge in avoiding over exploitation should wild harvesting of insects increase in Australia.</p><p>There have been instances where the popularity of an insect, and loss of traditional ecological knowledge, has resulted in over-harvesting in the wild leading to localised extinction <ref type="bibr" target="#b300">(Ramos-Elorduy, 2006)</ref>. Wild harvesting can also be compounded by land use change, intensive agriculture and climate change <ref type="bibr" target="#b402">(Yen, 2008)</ref> as shown in the case of the Australian edible insect, the bogong moth (Agrotis infusa) which migrates between lowland pastures and alpine regions (where it is harvested by First Nations people). Arsenic from agricultural sprays used in the low land areas is accumulated by the moth and transported to fragile alpine ecosystems <ref type="bibr" target="#b147">(Green, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b148">Green et al., 2001)</ref> elevating the presence of arsenic in these areas.</p><p>Farming insects also carries challenges and risks. Whilst being a poikilotherm benefits feed conversion efficiency, the same trait requires that the farmer maintain an optimal rearing temperature for the insect.

This knowledge gap underscores the need for comprehensive research to not only identify insect species but also understand their fundamental biological attributes and life cycles.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Thesis Outline</head><p>This thesis is guided by an emphasis on the identified need for multi-and trans-disciplinary approaches to advance the edible insect industry <ref type="bibr" target="#b368">(van Huis, 2017)</ref>. In this thesis, I aim to understand the social licence of edible insects in this country by investigating (1) the diversity and history of use of edible insect species in Aotearoa New Zealand and their place within our culture, and ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>) the uses and perceptions of New Zealanders towards consuming insects. I then focus on the biology of a well-known, but little researched, endemic edible insect species, the huhu grub P. reticularis to: (1) develop and assess the potential of metabolomic techniques to identify the provenance of edible insect species, using P. reticularis as a case study, (2) investigate the mating system of P. reticularis using static allometry and flight mills to assess the importance of traits associated with fitness in a scramble competition mating system, and (3) describe the sexually dimorphic antennal ultrastructure of P. reticularis to shed light on the importance of chemical ecology on this mating system.</p><p>In Chapter 2, I conduct a comprehensive review of the use of insects in Aotearoa New Zealand.</p><p>For this, I reviewed the literature, grey literature, newspaper articles, existing legislation, companies register, and websites of businesses selling insects for food, to (a) catalogue known species of insects used for food, past and present, (b) review what is currently known about potential native insect food species to identify promising candidates for rearing, (c) investigate the legislative and social landscape companies operate in, and (d) catalogue companies operating in this sector over the last 10 years, and how they market edible insects to the public.</p><p>In Chapter 3, using an online questionnaire, I explore the use and perceptions of the public towards insects as food in Aotearoa. The objective of this questionnaire was to identify the acceptability of insects as food, the traits associated with a willingness to eat insects, existing knowledge of edible insects, and the sentiments people exhibit towards insects as food. I analyse the data using a variety of techniques, including machine learning and sentiment analysis. I discuss my findings in the context of seemingly contradictory findings in Chapter 2.</p><p>After exploring the social licence within which the edible insect industry operates, I move to the biology of a charismatic edible insect species, that is well known to the public, the huhu beetle.</p><p>Chapter 4 assesses the potential of metabolomic fingerprinting as a tool for determining the provenance of an edible insect species. To achieve this, I sample the larvae of P. reticularis along a natural latitudinal gradient the length of Aotearoa. I compare two different derivatisation techniques using GC-MS to create a metabolomic profile of beetles from different locations. I then use a variety of statistical techniques to describe the variance in metabolic traits and train and test a random forest classification model to predict which location a larvae came from.</p><p>Chapter 5 focuses on unravelling the intricacies of P. reticularis' scramble competition mating system, characterised by intense male competition for access to females. The objective of this chapter is to discern the extent of sexual dimorphism and patterns of allometry on traits that are important for male fitness in scramble competition: sensory and locomotory traits. In this chapter, I design and build a flight mill to assess how wing size and body size influence flight performance. This chapter identifies tension between sexual selection and stabilising selection, contrasting P. reticularis with other species exhibiting scramble competition mating systems.</p><p>Chapter 6 builds on the findings of Chapter 5, by using scanning electron microscopy to describe in detail the sensory ultrastructures and dimorphism found in the antennae of P. reticularis. This chapter reveals unique structures only present on the male antennae and I discuss possible implications for the sensory ecology of this species.</p></div>

Insects have been highlighted by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) <ref type="bibr">(van Huis et al., 2013)</ref> as an important source of dietary protein and, due to key aspects of their biology, some insect species are a more sustainable option than sources of protein from livestock, poultry or seafood. Insects are poikilothermic <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Byrd &amp; Castner, 2002)</ref> which means energy gained from food is allocated to growth rather than maintaining body temperature <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Bartley et al., 1980)</ref>. This allows for a feed conversion efficiency higher than poultry and much higher than mammalian livestock <ref type="bibr" target="#b260">(Nakagaki &amp; Defoliart, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b320">Rumpold &amp; Schlüter, 2013)</ref>. Generally, most insects produce lower levels of greenhouse gasses than mammals and some species have the potential to convert organic waste into valuable products. Internationally, around 92% of edible insect species are wild harvested with 6% being semi-domesticated (i.e. not isolated from wild input) and 2% of species are farmed <ref type="bibr" target="#b403">(Yen, 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Most current research attention is directed towards farming a small number of cosmopolitan species, however, the insect kingdom in incredibly diverse and I would be shortsighted not to investigate other insects that are used as food around the world. The Pacific is often overlooked in discussions of insects as food despite having several wild harvested cerambycid species that are consumed, including Agrianome fairmairei, Oletherius spp., and Prionoplus reticularis which are consumed in New Caledonia, Fiji, Futuna, Sāmoa, Tonga and New Zealand <ref type="bibr" target="#b288">(Pond, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b323">Schintu &amp; Fasquel, 2019)</ref>. In New Zealand, there are several edible insect species that have been recorded in the literature: the aforementioned P. reticularis, Pyronota festiva (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae), Aenetus virescens (Lepidoptera: Hepialidae) <ref type="bibr" target="#b188">(Jongema, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b243">Meyer-Rochow &amp; Changkija, 1997)</ref>.</p><p>As a nation in which the majority of the population are of European descent (Stats NZ Tatauranga Aotearoa, 2018), consumption of insects in Aotearoa New Zealand is not perceived to be a common practice. Some insects, of which the huhu beetle larvae (P. reticularis) is best known, were consumed prior to European arrival. There is, however, an increasing interest in entomophagy in Aotearoa New Zealand <ref type="bibr" target="#b266">(O'Connor et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b282">P. Payne et al., 2023)</ref>. However, with a small number of exceptions, most insect food products in Aotearoa New Zealand are imported exotic species, characteristics which make it difficult to assess the sustainability and environmental impact of production.</p><p>Given this increasing interest in entomophagy amongst consumers, I believe that this is a worthwhile time to review the current state of entomophagy in Aotearoa New Zealand both within the market and current research into insect food production. I reviewed the literature, grey literature, newspaper articles, existing legislation, companies register, and websites of businesses selling insects for food, to (a) catalogue known species of insects used for food, past and present, and (b) review what is currently known about potential endemic food species to identify promising candidates for rearing, and (c) investigate the legislative and social landscape companies operate in, and (d) catalogue companies operating in this sector, and how they market edible insects to the public.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Definitions</head><p>Under the Food Standards Australia New Zealand Act 1991, "food" broadly refers to substances for human consumption, including ingredients, additives and substances used in preparation. It excludes goods with a therapeutic use i.e., medicines. Delineating between insects eaten entirely for nutrition rather than therapeutic good can be difficult especially when considering historical consumption (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b243">Meyer-Rochow &amp; Changkija, 1997</ref>) so I will include insects in this review that may have had dual purposes. For the purposes of this review, edible insects and entomophagy will only include the consumption of insects themselves and exclude products made by insects (e.g., honey).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Species catalogue</head><p>The species catalogue was composed of insects, endemic, native, and exotic, that are used in New Zealand for human consumption at present and historically. This was collated from the literature, grey literature, newspaper articles and businesses selling insects for food. Only a small number of endemic insect species appear in written records as being a food source and it is likely that knowledge relating to the harvesting and preparation of insects as food is held in oral histories or has been lost through colonisation. It should be stressed that the species presented that may have had a traditional use as food have not been confirmed with mana whenua and future research would greatly benefit from this (See O <ref type="bibr">'Connor et al., 2023)</ref>.</p><p>The grey literature shows there was often confusion with names in Te Reo Māori, variation in terms between different iwi, misidentification of species and substantial taxonomic revision since original publication <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Best, 1902;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b110">Ehau-Taumaunu et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b246">Miller, 1952)</ref>. Settler accounts of insects being used as food should be viewed in the context of colonisation. The eating of insects has been used as evidence that a culture is "primitive" as opposed to "civilised" which has been used as a justification for colonisation as noted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b208">Kosonen (2022)</ref>, "so-called "primitive" foodways like entomophagy have been instrumentalized in the colonial differentiations between civilization and primitivism". Further, an ethnographer's interest may bias their interpretation of their observations <ref type="bibr" target="#b240">(Mercier et al., 2022)</ref>. For instance <ref type="bibr">Drummond (1927a)</ref> states "as civilisation fosters fastidiousness, insects as food are repugnant to most civilised peoples". Yet, in Europe, the collection of the agricultural pest, Melontha sp., was practiced by French and Germans and the soup produced from it was considered a delicacy well into the 1900's (J. J. <ref type="bibr" target="#b327">Schneider, 1844;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b369">van Huis, 2020)</ref>. In a similar fashion, some caterpillars were noted as pests of Māori but also served as food, medicine and artistic ingredients <ref type="bibr" target="#b240">(Mercier et al., 2022)</ref>.</p><p>It would be naive to believe that the available literature accurately encompasses all pre-European uses of insects by Māori. While the anthropological record has identified species which were "traditionally" consumed, it is not possible to extrapolate how frequent and how widespread these practices were. An incalculable amount of knowledge of te ao Māori remains within oral histories and future studies would greatly benefit from a kaupapa Māori-led approach.</p><p>Consumption of most endemic/native species of insects has been largely replaced by exotic species imported from overseas (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">3</ref>). Of the ten known insect species that may have been included in a pre-European diet, only the huhu beetle (P. reticularis) is the widely known and used, frequently appearing in food festivals, popular culture and, briefly, a vodka brand <ref type="bibr" target="#b146">(Gordon, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b250">Modlik &amp; Johnston, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b330">Schulz, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b392">Ward, 2013)</ref>. The larvae of the huhu beetle are perhaps the most well-known of the insects in New Zealand that have been eaten as food. Wild harvest is currently the sole means of production of this insect for food and whilst there has been little research attention with the aim of commercial production of the species, there has been some research on their biology and ecology due to their potential as a pest in the timber products industry (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Alma &amp; van Boven, 1975;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Cross, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Dentener et al., 1999</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Dentener et al., , 2001;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b174">G.

At the meeting, characteristics of a species that would make it suitable for industrial production were suggested to be ''a high intrinsic rate of increase (r m ) (short development cycle, high survival of immatures and high oviposition rate); a high potential of biomass increase/day (weight gain/day); a high conversion rate (kg biomass gain/kg feedstock) the ability to live in high densities (kg biomass/m 2 ); and low vulnerability to diseases (resistance)" <ref type="bibr" target="#b378">(Vantomme et al., 2012)</ref>. Other factors that are suggested to be considered are whether the species is amenable to process automation, if the species can be contained in non-native areas and whether there any ecological impacts if they were to be introduced outside of their natural range, potential for the species to be genetically improved through selective breeding and quantification of the ecological footprint and water requirements of the species <ref type="bibr" target="#b378">(Vantomme et al., 2012)</ref>.

The language of the tribunal report limits this designation to species of flora or fauna in which an iwi, hapū, or whānau says it has a kaitiaki relationship, evidenced through a wide body of mātauranga Māori, whakapapa and kōrero. Meanwhile, for many Māori, "a 'taonga species' is simply any species which co-exists in their rohe, known or unknown" and the requirement to demonstrate a kaitiaki relationship is prohibitive <ref type="bibr" target="#b291">(Potter &amp; Māngai, 2022)</ref>.</p><p>Of particular interest to the commercialisation of insects, the chapter on "the genetic and biological resources of taonga species" contains recommendations relating to bioprospecting, genetic modification, and intellectual property. Start-up companies often rely on the protection of intellectual property to attract investment. This can be achieved in several ways: copyright for creative works, trademarks for protecting brand identity, patents to protect an invention meeting specific requirements, plant variety rights (PVRs) to give sole rights to the dissemination of a new variety of plant, and trade secrets that protect something a company considers to be commercially valuable.</p><p>While Ko Aotearoa tēnei is not legally binding, in 2019, The Crown announced that it was developing a whole-of-government approach to the report.

The act creates a Māori Plant Varieties Committee to administer these procedures and enables the cancellation of PVRs that have adverse effects on kaitiaki relationships.</p><p>One of the recommendations in Ko Aotearoa Tēnei is the establishment of a Māori Advisory Committee (MAC) within the Intellectual Property Office of New Zealand (IPONZ) and this was included in the Patents Act 2013. Upon request, the MAC provides advice to the commissioner on whether an invention is derived from Māori traditional knowledge and, if so, whether commercialisation of that invention would be contrary to Māori values. However, the role is purely advisory and there is no requirement for the commissioner to action the advice (Patents Act, 2013).</p><p>The WAI262 report will have wide ranging implications for research and commercialisation however the full extent of this is not yet known.

Insects are not explicitly listed as a "meat", but the written definition certainly applies to them. In New Zealand, most insects listed as "farmed meat" would be imported, most notably from Thailand. By contrast there are clear provisions for the trade of wild harvested insects in New Zealand which are listed under the Animal Products Act (APA) 1999 which requires certification for the hunter or person supplying the meat.</p><p>FSANZ recently released the recommendations from the Advisory Committee on Novel Foods (ACNF) on a small number of insects (super mealworm, Zophobas morio; house crickets, Acheta domestica; mealworm beetle, Tenebrio molitor) deeming them both "non-traditional" with no history of human consumption in New Zealand or Australia, and "non-novel", with no safety concerns identified. An amendment was later added regarding recent evidence around allergenicity of crickets when consumed by a person with a crustacean allergy (Food Standards Australia New Zealand, 2019). As non-novel foods, they are not subject to limits on consumption or import <ref type="bibr" target="#b307">(Reverberi, 2017)</ref>. While the concept of "novel foods" are a tool by which regulatory provisions may be made for individual species, it may be a cumbersome process for small-scale producers <ref type="bibr">(van Huis et al., 2013)</ref>.</p><p>Cumulatively, this suggests that while there are precedents of farmed and wild caught insects being allowed for consumption and import, the approval process seems to be relatively ad hoc and approval for wild caught meat is likely to be a much easier prospect for potential businesses than farming.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>New Zealand edible insect retailers and marketing practices</head><p>To assess how insects have been marketed in New Zealand, I collected publicly available text from edible insect companies' websites to identify the words which occurred most frequently in marketing. The text I used was taken preferentially from descriptions of the company and their mission statement. If the company only retailed one edible insect product amongst other food products, I used text from the product information. In one case, the company did not have a website and I collected text a profile written about the company in a local newspaper.</p><p>I used R and the tidytext package <ref type="bibr" target="#b335">(Silge &amp; Robinson, 2016)</ref> to prepare the text for analysis. A custom list of 599 stop words was compiled to remove words not relevant to insects or insect products (e.g., pronouns, articles, numbers). I made all nouns singular (so "insects" became "insect") and made abstract nouns and adjectives uniform (e.g., "environment", "environmental", "environmentally" became "environment"). I then quantified the top twenty most frequently used words and the top words used by all companies (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref> A &amp; B).</p><p>I identified eight (8) New Zealand based suppliers of edible insect products for human consumption that have been active within the last ten years (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">3</ref>). Of these, five companies imported insect products/ingredients from overseas, two companies sourced insects locally, and one company both imported and sourced local ingredients.</p><p>Cricket powder or flour was the most common product, retailed by six of the eight companies.</p><p>For five of the companies, cricket powder or flour was their only edible insect product, sometimes sold alongside other food and health products. Of these five, two companies modified imported cricket flour to produce protein bars, nacho chips, wraps and protein powder for retail. When the origins of imported ingredients were available Canada, South-East Asia and New Zealand were most frequent, and farmed was the primary method of production. The large number of companies selling cricket flour or food enriched with cricket flour appears to coincide with the increased availability of cricket flour being produced globally from 2013 onwards <ref type="bibr" target="#b308">(Reverberi, 2020)</ref>. By 2023, however, only two of the eight companies are still actively selling insect products suggesting a lack of commercial success. This could be due to several reasons including, market size and saturation, price and availability of raw materials (particularly during the pandemic), low demand with consumers, or difficulties marketing insect products to the New Zealand public. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 1. (A) The top 20 most frequently used words by New Zealand companies when marketing edible insect products. (B)</head><p>The number of companies using a particular word. The words "sustainable" and "protein" were used by all eight companies.</p><p>In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_26">1A</ref>, we see that the most frequently used words were descriptive of the product "cricket", "protein", "flour", "food" and "insect". The next most frequent words were "nutrition" and "sustainable", with the word "sustainable" being used by every company analysed (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref> (B)). The heavy emphasis on words such as "sustainable", "environment", "greenhouse gas" suggests that the companies and products are marketed towards environmentally minded consumers. The environmental benefits of insect farming over conventional livestock are highlighted in marketing. However, cricket flour often originates from overseas farms (e.g., Canada, Thailand) and long-distance shipping could impact the environmental footprint of these products and cause claims of sustainability to be misleading.</p><p>It has also been suggested that highlighting the environmental benefits of edible insects is not enough to persuade people to buy <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(Deroy et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b373">van Huis &amp; Rumpold, 2023)</ref>.

This was particularly important to one of the companies, who would only sell their products to chefs to ensure the first experience of a consumer would be a positive one.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Concluding remarks</head><p>New Zealand, like many temperate regions, is often regarded as having a depauperate number of native/endemic species that are consumed. However, I have found that this is not the case, with at least eleven endemic or native species with a history of consumption. This is likely to be a conservative estimate as colonial and neo-colonial influence has possibly resulted in the loss of oral histories that contained knowledge of species used as food. These unique insects could be an exciting addition to our cuisine providing any commercial development is done collaboratively with, or led by, mana whenua. Wild harvest is likely to be the primary method of obtaining native insects, due to the long and/or complex life cycle of many of our species.</p><p>However, further research may lead to opportunities in optimising the rearing of P. reticularis which could allow for farming.</p><p>Marketing of edible insects as environmentally sustainable alternatives to other animal proteins would benefit from a life cycle analysis to ensure claims are accurate. It is likely that use of imported ingredients reduces the environmental benefits that could otherwise be obtained by using these products. Developing a domestic supply of cricket flour, with New Zealand's ready access to renewable energy and agricultural by-products, could also assist in meeting the environmental benefits promised by edible insects. However, the small market size could be the most restrictive element to the development of an edible insect industry. Producing insects for use as pet and livestock feed whilst developing the market for insects as food may be a way for companies to stay financially viable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>The world's rapidly growing population, expected to reach over 9.7 billion by 2050 (United Nations, 2019), will increase the demand for animal proteins for food but also raises concerns for food security. Insects have been highlighted by the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) as an important source of dietary protein <ref type="bibr">(van Huis et al., 2013)</ref> and, due to aspects of their biology, some insect species are a more sustainable option than sources of protein from livestock, poultry or seafood <ref type="bibr" target="#b372">(van Huis &amp; Oonincx, 2017)</ref>. In Western countries, this has prompted investment in business start-ups seeking to farm insects to meet a perceived demand for insect protein and there is great potential for an increase in the use of insect protein globally.</p><p>Whilst over 1600 species of insects are used in the cuisine of many cultures around the world <ref type="bibr" target="#b371">(van Huis et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b376">Van Itterbeeck &amp; Pelozuelo, 2022)</ref>, consumption of insects is perceived to be relatively novel amongst many consumers from Western countries. However, novel does not necessarily refer to the invention of a technology but to its introduction to a market <ref type="bibr" target="#b334">(Siegrist &amp; Hartmann, 2020)</ref>. As the end users, and therefore paying customers of a product, consumers and their perceptions have an important role in the success of novel food technologies such as edible insects <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">(Dunphy &amp; Herbig, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b380">Verkerk et al., 2007)</ref>.</p><p>Current research on consumer perceptions and acceptance of edible insects predominantly concentrates on northern hemisphere countries. Studies have consistently identified gender, food neophobia, disgust sensitivity, and prior insect consumption as general predictors of individuals' attitudes towards insects as a food source <ref type="bibr" target="#b166">(Hartmann &amp; Siegrist, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b217">Lensvelt &amp; Steenbekkers, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b270">Orsi et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b324">Schlup &amp; Brunner, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b379">Verbeke, 2015)</ref>. Research has also shown that an existing awareness of edible insects positively influences consumer acceptance of insects as food <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Barsics et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b209">Kostecka et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b379">Verbeke, 2015)</ref>. Individuals who have tried insects in the past tend to exhibit a significantly higher positive attitude towards insects as food than those who have not <ref type="bibr" target="#b398">(Wilkinson et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Generally, Western consumers are often associated with harbouring negative sentiments towards edible insects, although this perception can vary based on whether the insects are consumed whole, processed, or integrated into familiar food items. However, recent reviews caution against treating Western cultures as a homogeneous entity due to subtle and nuanced differences between various cultures and countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Ardoin &amp; Prinyawiwatkul, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b231">Mancini et al., 2019)</ref>.</p><p>For instance, Central European and French Quebecers share similar views on edible insects but differ from those of English speaking North Americans (Hénault-Ethier et al., 2020), and earlyadopting Northern European countries like Finland and Sweden exhibit a more positive attitude toward insect consumption compared to Central European countries such as Germany and the Czech Republic (Piha et al., 2018). Countries with strong traditions of insect eating, such as Mexico, Peru and Thailand, are more willing to consume products containing insect powder, suggesting that cultures that already incorporate insects into cuisine are more accepting of novel insect products (Castro &amp; Chambers IV, 2019; Hartmann et al., 2015). Studies investigating consumer acceptance in the Australasia region focus primarily on Australia (Bogueva &amp; Schmidinger, 2019; Castro &amp; Chambers IV, 2019; Chan, 2019; Lensvelt &amp; Steenbekkers, 2014; G. Myers &amp; Pettigrew, 2018; Sogari et al., 2019; Wilkinson et al., 2018) with two studies from New Zealand (O'Connor et al., 2023; P. Payne et al., 2023) and no studies from other Pacific Island nations. Australia and New Zealand present an interesting comparison as both are predominantly English speaking settler countries, share a legislative framework governing the use of novel food items including insects, a fledgling insect farming industry, and have Indigenous traditions of consuming insects (Food Standards Australia New Zealand, 2019; Lähteenmäki-Uutela et al., 2021; O'Connor et al., 2023; P.

However, the specific objects or behaviours that trigger disgust are often culturally influenced, rooted in societal norms and moral values <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Curtis &amp; Biran, 2001)</ref>. Food neophobia, closely related to disgust, represents the aversion to unfamiliar foods and has been identified as a key predictor of the acceptance of insects as a novel food source and it is also influenced by cultural factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b165">(Hartmann et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr"></ref> La <ref type="bibr" target="#b212">Barbera et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b379">Verbeke, 2015)</ref>.

Overcoming these deeply ingrained perceptions poses a considerable challenge to the acceptance of edible insect products.</p><p>To address these barriers, various strategies have been proposed. These strategies include normalising the consumption of edible insects by gradually increasing their visibility in everyday life, a process akin to 'public exposure therapy' <ref type="bibr" target="#b206">(Koch et al., 2021)</ref>.

However, the strategies highlighted by participants to increase uptake are remarkably similar to those suggested in the literature. Strategies suggested include: disguising insects (concealing "animalness" by processing into a powder), ensuring safety through guarantees, inclusion on restaurant menus, instructions on cooking at home and utilising mass media to increase knowledge of the benefits of insects as food (G. <ref type="bibr" target="#b257">Myers &amp; Pettigrew, 2018)</ref>. It has been demonstrated that being unwilling to eat insects does not necessarily mean being unsupportive of the research and development of an insects as a food industry <ref type="bibr" target="#b319">(Ruby et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>In New Zealand, texture, taste and disgust are perceived as barriers to insect consumption and the preferred way of consuming an insect was as a powder followed by frying the insect (P. <ref type="bibr" target="#b282">Payne et al., 2023)</ref> which suggests that presenting the food in a culturally relevant context, such as incorporated into an existing food item (e.g. breads or pasta) or deep frying to avoid a texture that is not perceived to be pleasant (e.g., a "squish"). Demographic attributes that were found to impact willingness to consume insects included age and gender with participants in the age bracket 56 and above less willing to eat insects and males were significantly more willing to eat insects than females (O'Connor et al., 2023; P. <ref type="bibr" target="#b282">Payne et al., 2023)</ref>.</p><p>Several insect species have been used as traditional and contemporary sources of food in New Zealand, such as the huhu grub (Prionoplus reticularis), black field cricket (Teleogryllus commodus) and locust (Locusta migratoria). Current use of these insects relies on wild harvest in the case of the huhu beetle or farming in the case of black field crickets and locusts. There is occasional use of insects as ingredients in restaurants and in products available in supermarkets as well as features in the media on insects as food. Given the traditional use of insects as food and the consumer availability of insect-based products, it could be assumed that knowledge of insects as food is reasonably widespread and uncontroversial throughout Aotearoa New Zealand, however, this has not been quantified.</p><p>Understanding the drivers of consumer acceptance as well as consumer perceptions, knowledge, and use of insects in Aotearoa New Zealand is important to assist in the development of this sector as it grows. Using an online questionnaire and a mixed methods approach, I set out to quantify existing public knowledge of edible insect species, the beliefs and attitudes associated with insects as food, understand drivers influencing the likelihood of eating an insect in the future, and the sentiment attached to insects when seen as ingredients on a menu. I hypothesised</p><p>(1) prior experience of consuming insects and a greater knowledge of insects as food will increase the likelihood of being willing to eat insects in the future, (2) that negative words would be attributed to insects more than other food types.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods Participants</head><p>Participants were recruited via organic (shared by users of social media) and paid for (targeted adverts) social media posts. An anonymous, online questionnaire was designed using the online survey platform Qualtrics (v. August 2021, Qualtrics, Provo, UT). The questionnaire comprised five sections, (1) categorisation of participants; (2) knowledge and perceptions of edible insects;</p><p>(3) experience of eating insects; (4) likelihood of eating an insect or insect containing product in the future, and (5) demographic questions. The questionnaire used branch logic to conditionally present questions based on a participant's previous answers.</p><p>I received n = 735 responses to the questionnaire. Any responses that were indicated as spam (n = 3) or did not make it to the end of the questionnaire (n = 113) were discarded giving a total number of n = 620 for summary statistics. For the machine learning workflow, I removed any respondents who answered "prefer not to say" for any demographic questions (n = 60), leaving n = 560 for the logistic regression analysis. The median time taken to complete the questionnaire was 11.72 minutes (lower quartile = 8.88, upper quartile = 17.20).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Demographics</head><p>The demographic data collected were dietary preference, age, gender, ethnicity, country of birth, region of New Zealand, education, and income. For ethnicity data, answers were categorised into Level One groupings (European, Māori, Pacific Peoples, Asian, Middle Eastern/Latin American/African (MELAA), and Other Ethnicity). Where multiple categories were selected, I used a prioritised output (Māori, Pacific peoples, Asian, other groups except NZ European; and NZ European) (Ministry of Health, 2004). For dietary preference participants could write freely and these were then coded into six categories (omnivore, pescetarian, flexitarian, vegetarian, vegan, allergy/medical).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Existing knowledge</head><p>To investigate existing knowledge of edible insects, I asked participants "Can you list any insects that you know are used as food in Aotearoa New Zealand?". I quantified how many insects or insect products each participant knew as a count. Answers were grouped to a single common name to make consistent (e.g., huhu beetle, huhu bug, huhu grub and huhu larvae were grouped into huhu grubs). I categorised answers by insect order (e.g., Hymenoptera for ants, coleoptera)</p><p>and if a response referred to an organism or a product of an insect (e.g., insect flour, honey, cochineal) and presented in a table.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Likert Scales</head><p>Likert scales were used to measure the impact of COVID-19 on the willingness to eat novel food items, future likelihood of eating an insect, food neophobia, specific beliefs and attitudes, and encouragement.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Impact of COVID-19 on willingness to eat novel food items</head><p>To assess whether the Covid-19 pandemic impacted willingness to try an unfamiliar food ingredient, I used a 7-point likely-unlikely scale and asked the question "Imagine you are visiting a new restaurant, compared to pre-COVID-19, how likely are you to try a dish containing:" and presented with three items; (1) an unfamiliar ingredient, (2) an insect, (3) and an unfamiliar animal protein.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Future likelihood of eating insects</head><p>I asked all participants what their future likelihood of eating an insect was, creating two groups "likely" and "unlikely". Depending on the responses, I asked the reasons for this. For the unlikely group, the options were: allergic to shellfish/insects, religious reasons, dietary reasons, disgusted by insects, fear of insects, other (please specify). For the likely group, the options were:</p><p>sustainability/environmental benefits, price, health benefits, curiosity, cultural reasons, taste/flavour, other (please specify).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Food neophobia, specific beliefs and attitudes, and encouragement</head><p>Participants were categorised using the following scales: a food neophobia score (FNS) (ten questions with a likert scale from 1 to 7, then each score was added to give a value out of 70, higher scores indicate a higher degree of neophobia; adapted from Pliner and Hobden (1992)), specific beliefs and attitudes towards insects as food (nine questions with a likert scale of 1 to 5, covering themes of disgust, risk, benefits, ethics and naturalness <ref type="bibr" target="#b319">(Ruby et al., 2015)</ref>), and attitudes towards the research and promotion of eating insects (two questions with a likert scale of 1 to 7 <ref type="bibr" target="#b319">(Ruby et al., 2015)</ref>).</p></div>

It can allow access to emotions and motivations that may not be picked up using a quantitative scale. I used a word association exercise which asked, "You are reading a menu when you see the following ingredient in a dish, what are the first words or phrases that you think of?". One ingredient was presented at a time and in a random order. The ingredients were: lamb, locust, tofu, mealworm, beef, silkworm pupae, jackfruit, grasshopper, chicken, huhu grub, kumara, cricket flour, shrimp, and sky prawn (an alternative name for a locust). These ingredients fell into three broad categories of "conventional" animal, plant, and insect ingredients with the exception of sky prawn and silkworm pupae which were included to examine how participants respond to branding of an edible insect (sky prawn) and to the inclusion of an unfamiliar edible insect protein (silkworm pupae). The data were cleaned (e.g., removing punctuation, consolidating different spelling) using OpenRefine (v. 3.7.0), resulting in 18,808 responses consisting of 7405 unique words or phrases for analysis. Each word or phrase was attributed a sentiment (positive = 1, negative = -1, or neutral = 0).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Topics/Themes</head><p>To extract important themes from the word association data, I used term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) <ref type="bibr" target="#b321">(Salton &amp; Buckley, 1988)</ref>. TF-IDF is a technique used in text mining to suggest the topic of an individual document within a corpus (a collection of documents). In our context, a document was a specific ingredient in a menu item and the corpus was composed of all of the specific ingredients (see word association section for list of ingredients). TF-IDF is comprised of two parts, the term frequency (TF) and the inverse document frequency (IDF). Firstly, the term frequency is calculated within a document by counting the number of times a word or phrase appears within the document. Secondly, the inverse document frequency is calculated by dividing the number of documents by the number of documents containing a term and then taking the log of the output. This leads to terms that are unique to specific documents, indicating predictive power, being ranked highly, whilst terms common to all documents are given a lower ranking.</p></div>

With all options 26% of respondents stated they were neither more or less likely to try an unfamiliar ingredient, insect, or unfamiliar animal protein.</p><p>When responses were grouped based on those who had eaten an insect ('yes' group, n = 367) and those who had not eaten an insect ('no' group, n = 253), I found the 'Yes' group were much more likely to try an unfamiliar ingredient (70%, 58% and 54% vs. 55%, 35% and 32%) than not (4%, 17% and 19% vs. 18%, 41% and 41%) the neither more nor less likely category was largely the same between both groups (ranging from 24% -27%).  Encouragement of Insects as Food (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_34">4</ref>)</p><p>In response to the question "We should encourage research on insects as food", the majority of participants agreed (89%). When responses were grouped based on those who had eaten an insect, this rose to 94% and when grouped by those who had not eaten an insect it decreased to 82%. In response to the question "We should support programs designed to encourage people to consume insects", the majority of participants agreed (78%). When responses were grouped based on those who had eaten an insect, this rose to 85% and when grouped by those who had not eaten an insect it decreased to 67%. Likelihood of eating an insect in the future (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_35">5</ref>)</p><p>Overall, the majority of participants were likely to eat an insect in the future (76%). When grouped by whether they had eaten an insect in the past, the majority of the 'Yes' and 'No' groups were likely to be willing to eat an insect in the future. The 'Yes' group, had a higher proportion of people who were likely to eat insects (88% vs. 60% in 'No'), and within the likely group, a larger proportion of participants indicated they were 'Extremely Likely' to try insects in the future. In contrast, in the 'No' group, there were a larger proportion of people who were unlikely to try insects (40% vs. 12% in 'Yes') and within this 'Unlikely Group' a larger proportion indicated 'Extremely Unlikely' to eat an insect. </p></div>

Neutral responses were the most common type of response across all groups.

Words/phrases provided by participants for each food item were assigned a score: -1 for a negative sentiment, 0 for a neutral sentiment and 1 for a positive sentiment.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Words or Phrases Associated With Insect Products</head><p>In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">9</ref>, words that have the greatest discriminatory power are plotted for each insect ingredient. Different ingredients have clear differences in the words used to describe them, corresponding to the differences in sentiment seen in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_39">8B</ref>. When compared to animal and plant ingredients (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">10</ref> &amp; Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">11</ref>), I can see that insect ingredients tend to be less associated with food, and focus more on perceived physical properties of insects such as their movement or texture.</p><p>Words used to describe grasshoppers and locusts focused on physical characteristics ("green", "legs", "crunchy"). Grasshoppers do appear to have more positive associations ("cute", "jiminy cricket") than locusts and their possible role in food was mentioned ("flour"). Locusts were frequently described in negative historical terms ("swarm", "plague", "pest", "biblical", "Egypt")</p><p>suggesting they are associated with their impacts on human society and agriculture through history.</p><p>Huhu grubs were described by perceived flavour profile and texture ("peanut butter", "gooey", "creamy", "slimy"), their ecology ("native", "bush", "beetle"), their cultural significance ("Māori"). Broadly, the words used to describe huhu grubs were neutral or positive and fairly specific, reflecting their unique and culturally significant status as a food source in New Zealand.</p><p>Both mealworms and silkworm pupae had a median negative sentiment, and this is reflected in the words participants associated with them. Descriptive words, describing perceived movement or textural qualities featured heavily and were similar for both ingredients ("wriggly", "squishy", "crunchy", "slimy", "worm", "maggot"). There was also a focus on the human utility of these insects with the use of silkworms in textiles highlighted ("silk", "cocoon", "thread", "clothing")</p><p>and the use of mealworms in the pet industry ("pet food", "fish food", "bird food", "chicken food", "frog food", "lizards") however, neither ingredient was associated with human food with any frequency.</p><p>Sky prawns, a name used in the marketing of locusts, were largely met with confusion and unfamiliarity amongst respondents. The most frequent phrases associated with this ingredient were variations of "what is a sky prawn?". There was an association with familiar foods ("seafood", "prawn", "flying prawn", "crustacean") and some respondents correctly identified the ingredient as an insect ("locust", "cricket") however, there seems to be a general lack of recognition and understanding of the term.</p><p>On the other hand, cricket flour, which had a positive median sentiment score, was described using words that suggest it is perceived in a positive way ("curious", "interesting") as an environmentally friendly ("green", "environmental", and "alternative") and nutritious ("high protein", "gluten free") alternative to traditional flour. There appears to be associations between cricket flour and traditional culinary applications ("bread", "pancake," and "tortilla") suggesting that respondents associate this ingredient with foods. Discussion My research found strong support for insect consumption in New Zealand, in contrast to my findings on the viability of New Zealand edible insect businesses in the previous chapter. A majority of respondents had prior experience with insect consumption, expressing a willingness to continue eating insects in the future. Participants also possessed knowledge of edible insect species found in New Zealand, with huhu grubs and crickets being the most frequently mentioned species. Using a logistic regression model, several key predictors were influential in increasing the likelihood of future insect consumption, including prior experience with eating insects, familiarity with edible insect species, and a low food neophobia score (FNS). Factors such as gender, income, and education level did not appear to significantly influence individuals' likelihood of consuming insect-based foods. Despite this general openness to insect consumption, the analysis of the language used to describe insect ingredients reveals a contradiction; the average sentiment of the descriptors for insect-based ingredients was more negative than for plant or animal ingredients, with the exception of cricket flour which elicited more favourable associations.</p><p>Prior experience of eating insects was found to be an important predictor of future likelihood of eating insects, which was consistent with findings in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b165">(Hartmann et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b166">Hartmann &amp; Siegrist, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b239">Menozzi et al., 2017)</ref>. Existing knowledge of edible insect species was also a significant predictor of future likelihood of eating insects. My findings suggest that New Zealanders are familiar with some edible insects, with huhu grubs and crickets both being frequently referenced by respondents. Familiarity has also been shown to be an important factor in food choice and it is commonly held that Western societies are unfamiliar with insects as food <ref type="bibr" target="#b171">(Hoek et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b379">Verbeke, 2015)</ref>. However, that does not appear to be the case in New</p><p>Zealand with a large number of participants able to name one or more species of edible insect (n = 498). Huhu grubs in particular were recognised by participants with 54% (n = 333) of respondents listing the huhu grub as an edible insect, reflecting the iconic status of this endemic species. Crickets were mentioned by 48% (n = 298) of respondents which is likely due to the high-profile crickets have received in both global and local media coverage of edible insects.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, a respondents' food neophobia score is negatively correlated with the likelihood of eating insects. It is likely that food neophobia is closely related to disgust <ref type="bibr" target="#b165">(Hartmann et al., 2015)</ref>, an emotion believed to have evolved to reduce the risk of disease, contaminants and poison <ref type="bibr" target="#b265">(Oaten et al., 2009)</ref>. It is difficult to overcome an emotional response using rational means although this can help in assuaging fears of sickness and disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b185">(Jensen &amp; Lieberoth, 2019)</ref>. There is a significant cultural component to food neophobia which presents an opportunity to change people's perceptions towards insects as food over time through increasing public exposure (visibility of products in shops) and focussing on the sensory, gastronomic and marketing aspects of these products <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(Deroy et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b206">Koch et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b212">La Barbera et al., 2018)</ref>. Frequently, insects as food are compared to caviar, lobsters, sushi and sashimi as foods which were once considered disgusting to many Western cultures but have since become popular <ref type="bibr" target="#b206">(Koch et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b318">Ruby &amp; Rozin, 2019)</ref>, and it has been suggested that emulating the route-tomarket of sushi in the West could be an option for insect products (Cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b177">House, 2018)</ref>. Given the importance of prior experience and existing knowledge in influencing individuals' openness to eating insects, educational tastings are one way to increase exposure to, and acceptance of, insects as food <ref type="bibr" target="#b342">(Sogari et al., 2017)</ref>. Employing a trained professional to cook the insects in a culturally relevant way whilst educating on the history and benefits of insects as food enables the first experience to be a positive one.</p><p>Despite most participants stating their approval towards insects as food, the word association exercise revealed an interesting contradiction; insect ingredients on a menu received a higher number of words with a negative sentiment than animal or vegetable ingredients. This suggests that there may be unconscious bias around insect ingredients and insects as food. Investigating the words people use when thinking about insects provides an opportunity to assess how people conceptualise insect ingredients and insects more broadly. By ranking words with the greatest discriminatory power for a food item (i.e., words that distinguished an insect ingredient from other ingredients), I found that insects evoke strong imagery with cultural, historical and biological contexts playing a clear role in shaping participants' perceptions of insects. For instance, locusts evoked Judeo-Christian references with: bible, plague, swarm, and Egypt; whilst references to children's movies (The Lion King and Pinocchio) appeared fairly often for huhu grubs and grasshoppers. Menu items that contained the term pupae or worm (silkworm pupae and mealworms) tended to evoke negative reactions. Also, responses were often not directly associated with food; instead being descriptive of the appearance, texture and movement of the insect (maggot, worms, larvae, moth, wriggly/wiggly, squishy, slimy), or their associated uses by humans (silk, clothing, thread, pet food, bird food, frog food etc.).</p><p>Cricket flour was the only ingredient with a mean positive sentiment score. The words that participants associated with cricket flour tended to match existing food concepts, for example; bread, pancake, tortilla, baking, gluten-free, and high protein. These are food items that either are associated with flour or are products containing cricket flour that have been marketed in New</p><p>Zealand. This supports previous research finding that processing an insect into a meal or flour is preferred by New Zealand consumers (P. <ref type="bibr" target="#b282">Payne et al., 2023)</ref>. Other words used to describe cricket flour related to sustainability such as: environmental, alternative, and green. Sustainability over other livestock and environmental benefits are an area that has been marketed heavily by companies selling cricket flour as shown in Chapter 1. Other words used to describe cricket flour indicated generally positive sentiments and acceptance as a food ingredient: interesting, curious, and no problem. Overall, the words participants used to describe cricket flour highlights the effectiveness of the marketing and media attention this product has received.</p><p>However, associating an ingredient with food does not guarantee that it will be well received. In the case of sky prawn, a marketing term used for locusts in New Zealand and overseas, the overwhelming response was of confusion (words and phrases that occurred with frequency were:</p><p>"what", "unknown", "no idea what this is", "never heard of it", "what is a skyprawn"). This indicates that the product has not achieved the same kind of public awareness as cricket flour and that attaching a word that is associated with food (i.e., prawn) is not enough to guarantee it will be well received. Providing more context would likely assist in alleviating feelings of distrust in this food product and it should be noted that the menu item was presented to survey participants without context. In a restaurant setting there would likely be access to further information (e.g., via the menu or waiter) and research has shown that being well informed reduces feelings of distrust <ref type="bibr" target="#b328">(Schouteten et al., 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Despite this, the use of "sky prawn" as a marketing device is a clever way of pointing out the morphological similarities between insects and crustaceans, which are already consumed, generally without issue. Indeed, at an evolutionary scale, insects are closely related to crustaceans, sitting within the clade Pancrustacea <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Aleshin et al., 2009)</ref>, and a recent review of the functional food properties of insects and shrimps, highlights that the shared phylogenetic history means that they should be viewed as terrestrial and marine counterparts with similar attributes and opportunities for exploration of novel functional food properties <ref type="bibr" target="#b248">(Mishyna &amp; Glumac, 2021)</ref>.</p><p>Huhu grubs, which are a well-known edible insect in New Zealand (54% of participants identified huhu grubs as an edible insect), provide an interesting area to explore in the future.</p><p>Participants had clear associations between huhu grubs and food with preconceived notions (positive or negative) of flavours and textures mentioned frequently (e.g., peanut butter, gooey, creamy, squishy, slimy). Participants also associated huhu grubs with Māori culture, bush (a New</p><p>Zealand term for native forest) and native insects which suggests that there is a strong cultural association between huhu grubs and food in New Zealand.  <ref type="bibr">et al., 2023)</ref>. Clearly there are opportunities for Māori-led businesses to develop and lead in this space and it would appear that there is a high level of acceptance of insects as food by Māori.</p><p>Indigenous groups reclaiming and promoting culinary practices to promote insects and other indigenous ingredients in an authentic way whilst preserving and reviving traditional harvesting techniques and knowledge should be supported and encouraged (Bermúdez-Serrano, 2020;</p><p>Reyes &amp; Lessard, 2023). Restaurants such as Amazónico, in Colombia, and Hiakai, in New Zealand, are championing local culinary practices in contemporary dishes <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">(Fiso et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b356">Taylor, 2023)</ref>. At Hiakai, award winning chef Monique Fiso uses traditional ingredients, including huhu grubs, in her restaurant whilst also promoting the sustainable harvesting of ingredients according to tikanga (customs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">(Fiso et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>I measured participants specific beliefs and attitudes towards insects as food, finding that the majority of participants had positive attitudes towards insects as food, finding that the majority of participants agreed that insects were highly nutritious, good for the environment and are capable of feeling pain whilst disagreeing that eating insects is disgusting, unnatural or immoral and disagreeing that insects carry harmful microbes, toxins or increase the risk of disease. My findings contrast with those of <ref type="bibr" target="#b319">Ruby et al. (2015)</ref> of American and Indian perceptions towards eating insects whose participants agreed that eating insects is disgusting, not natural for humans and that insects carry harmful microbes, whilst disagreeing that eating insects is good for the environment. This highlights there can be stark differences in perceptions between different cultures and lends support to avoid treating Western cultures as one homogenous entity <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Ardoin &amp; Prinyawiwatkul, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b231">Mancini et al., 2019)</ref>.</p><p>Participants' agreement with the statement that insects are capable of feeling pain raises ethical considerations regarding the treatment of insects in farming and harvesting situations, an area that has received less research attention than other aspects of insect farming. Given a majority of participants agree (53%) or are uncertain (30%) that insects feel pain but disagree (67%) or are uncertain (22%) that it is immoral to kill them, it would be reasonable to assume that there is social licence to farm and kill insects but an expectation amongst the public that a duty of care towards the animal is taken into account when farming. Whether insects feel pain is an area still under debate and has implications for the development of welfare practices within the industry (van Huis, 2021). Similar discussions have occurred within the aquaculture industry regarding pain in fish, animal welfare and legislation and there may be opportunities to learn from these <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">(Franks et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b316">Rose et al., 2014)</ref>. However, farmers point out that applying codes of welfare from other sectors is unlikely to work directly with insects <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Bear, 2019)</ref>. There is difficulty in distinguishing nociception (the detection of noxious stimuli) and pain (the subjective experience of actual or perceived pain) empirically and so it would be best to approach the topic philosophically. The current landscape of insect welfare was recently summarised providing an excellent overview of the topic (van Huis, 2021), and a recent article investigated the complexities of care involved in insect rearing in New Zealand <ref type="bibr" target="#b401">(Yee &amp; Sharp, 2023)</ref>.</p><p>Questionnaires as a research tool carries limitations which I have attempted to minimise but is still worth bearing in mind when interpreting the results. The sampling technique involved advertising on social media and snowballing which made it difficult to collect a representative sample of the New Zealand population and thus the results should not be generalised to the whole of New Zealand. Similar to a recent survey (P. <ref type="bibr" target="#b282">Payne et al., 2023)</ref>, this survey had a bias towards participants being European females with higher levels of education and higher income than would be expected from a representative sample of New Zealand. There are two potential sources of bias which are inherent in surveys: (1) social desirability bias where participants answer questions in a way they feel will be viewed favourably, which I hope to have minimised by having an anonymous questionnaire, and (2) the value-action gap where participants intentions are different to their actions (e.g., saying will eat insects in future may not translate to carrying through with this).</p><p>The value-action gap is a well-known phenomenon in sustainability research <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Barr, 2006)</ref>, and has been shown to influence the purchase of sustainable food products <ref type="bibr" target="#b381">(Vermeir &amp; Verbeke, 2006)</ref>. Participants in my study expressed a willingness to consume insects, but the overall sentiment when describing insects was negative. When viewed alongside the limited viability of companies specialising in insects as food (discussed in Chapter 1) I suggest this may indicate a disconnect between value and action and that future research should prioritise this area.</p><p>In summary, my findings suggest that participants are accepting of insects as food with many having prior experience and some existing knowledge, which, along with a low neophobia score, predicted likelihood of consuming in the future. Despite this approval, an analysis of the language used to describe insects as food uncovered a nuanced contradiction where the sentiment of descriptors for insect ingredients were, on average, more negative than traditional meat or vegetable ingredients. However, the notable exception to this was for cricket flour which demonstrates the effectiveness of the marketing used for this product and lends support to the idea of processing insects to disguise their appearance. The specific beliefs and attitudes of participants towards insects suggest differences to how other cultures perceive insects as food and indicate that future research should be directed towards the welfare and ethics of insect farming. I conclude by suggesting that future development of edible insects in New Zealand should build on the existing awareness of crickets and huhu grubs to leverage off existing acceptance and the unique history of these insects as food in New Zealand.</p></div>

Whilst edible insects are enjoyed in many countries around the world, demand for edible insects in Western nations has increased since the publication of a 2013 FAO report, proposing insects as a more sustainable alternative to livestock <ref type="bibr">(van Huis et al., 2013)</ref>. Generally, this demand has been satisfied through the farming of insects, such as crickets and mealworms. These are usually sourced from domestic or international production and legislative constraints on what can be sold as food in Western countries restricts the use of wild insects. There has been discussion</p><p>around the flavour of wild harvested insects being superior to farmed insects <ref type="bibr">(Evans et al., 2017, p. 179)</ref>, and demand for wild insects for gourmet use is likely to increase over time.</p><p>In many countries around the world, insects are wild sourced and an increase in demand could place undue strain on populations already experiencing challenges with climate change, habitat loss and pollution (van Huis <ref type="bibr" target="#b372">&amp; Oonincx, 2017)</ref>. This has occurred in some countries with an existing history of eating insects. Whilst insects have been sustainably harvested for generations by indigenous peoples with an intimate knowledge of the life cycle and ecology of the species, there is evidence that changes in environment, the impact of human development, urbanisation, along with growing demand for insects from outside of these communities, is putting insect populations at risk <ref type="bibr" target="#b372">(van Huis &amp; Oonincx, 2017)</ref>. Mexico, a country with a rich history of insect use, many of which are highly sought after, provides a useful case study. <ref type="bibr" target="#b300">Ramos-Elorduy (2006)</ref> studied the use of 30 edible insect species over a 25 year period in the village of Tulancalco, Mexico. In this village, there have been changes in the population demographics over several generations where people have moved from villages to cities. There are still strong ties to the food culture, and this drives high prices for insects for sale in the city.</p><p>This demand for insects is fulfilled by outsiders who are not familiar with the traditions and deep ecological knowledge held by villagers and now, of these 30 species, 14 are threatened and at risk of local extinction (Ramos-Elorduy, 2006). There are other examples of wild populations of edible insects that are no longer sustainable to harvest due to a variety of pressures, including crickets belonging to the genus Oxya in Asia, aquatic hemipterans in Mexico and India and the larvae of Lepidoptera in Africa and Australia (Badillo-Camacho et al., 2015; Parsons, 2010; Ramos-Elorduy, 2006; Samom, 2016; van Huis &amp; <ref type="bibr" target="#b372">Oonincx, 2017)</ref>. Whilst the causes of decline in these species are multi-faceted, it is possible to reverse population loss and restore the sustainability of wild harvest. For instance, an increase in pesticide use in farming has led to a decrease in the populations of Oxya spp. crickets in Korea and Japan which has resulted in a reduction in their use as food (C. L. R. <ref type="bibr" target="#b280">Payne, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b283">Pemberton, 1994)</ref>. However, when farmers in areas of Korea moved away from pesticide use, the Oxya spp. populations returned and their use as a food saw a revival <ref type="bibr" target="#b283">(Pemberton, 1994)</ref>.</p><p>Given the suitability of harvesting an insect population can vary geographically, is there a way to ascertain if an edible insect comes from a specific geographic region within a country? This would allow consumers, legislators, or importers to confirm an insect comes from a region where it is sustainable to harvest from and thereby make an informed decision.</p><p>Metabolomics would appear to be an ideal candidate for this as the metabolome of an organism is intricately shaped by its biology and the environment it inhabits. Several New Zealand studies have explored using metabolomics to characterise the metabolomic profile of native and endemic New Zealand species, showing that the geographical location and environmental factors experienced influence the metabolomic profile of the organism. In a study of scale insects in New Zealand, <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Dhami et al. (2011)</ref> found that the metabolite composition of honey dew varied between species, sites and host tree suggesting that geographic location alone is not the sole driver of differences between metabolite profiles. <ref type="bibr" target="#b145">Goode et al. (2020)</ref> investigated the metabolome of snapper Chrysophrys auratus (prev. Pagrus aurata) from different harbours around New Zealand finding that differences in amino acids were attributable to turbidity of their environment, an aspect known to be a stressor resulting in suboptimal physiological responses.</p><p>Temperature is another important environmental variable that is known to impact the metabolism of organisms. In New Zealand, metabolites have been identified that can be used to detect thermally stressed green-lipped mussels (Perna canaliculus).</p><p>The endemic cerambycid longhorn beetle, Prionoplus reticularis, better known as the edible huhu grub, is an ideal candidate to explore the effect of geography and latitude on variation of metabolomic profiles. The species is found throughout Aotearoa New Zealand from Northland to Stewart Island and the larvae infest rotten logs of several different host plant species, including Pinus radiata (radiata pine). P. radiata accounts for 90% of New Zealand's forestry stock and is found across New Zealand <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Beets et al., 2012)</ref>, which allows for an assessment of geographic variation in metabolites in huhu, while controlling for a consistent diet.</p><p>I used GC-MS (gas chromatography -mass spectrometry) to investigate the relative abundance of metabolites in the huhu grub (Prionoplus reticularis) collected from Pinus radiata, along a latitudinal gradient the length of New Zealand. I investigated (1) variation in metabolites and lipids of huhu between individuals and locations, (2) whether metabolites of huhu show a trend along a latitudinal gradient, and (3) if FAAs, FAs &amp; sugar metabolites can be used to 'fingerprint' an individual to a geographic location.</p></div>

Agilent Chemstation was used to create a subset of the Wiley and NIST Libraries.

For the MCF analysis, I merged both the NIST library and in-house libraries. For the TMS analysis, I used the in-house library.

The PERMANOVA was performed using the R package 'vegan' <ref type="bibr" target="#b267">(Oksanen et al., 2022)</ref> with n = 10,000 permutations. I then performed pairwise comparisons on significant terms to compare between different groups. P values were adjusted using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure.</p><p>To assess if I could classify a random huhu grub sample to the location it was sampled from, I used a random forest (RF) supervised machine learning algorithm to construct a classification model. RF is suited to high dimensional data, where there are a high number of features (metabolites/compounds) to samples <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Acharjee et al., 2016)</ref>. RF uses random feature selection from a bootstrap sample of each branch to create an ensemble of classification trees from which class prediction calculated from a simple majority vote. As RF is prone to overfitting <ref type="bibr" target="#b119">(Fawagreh et al., 2014)</ref>, data were split into a training set of 2/3 and testing set of 1/3 to calculate out-ofbag (OOB) error and a confusion matrix. A variable importance measure was also calculated by measuring the increase in the OOB error when a metabolite is permuted whilst all others are left the same. I Implemented this through the 'randomForest' R package <ref type="bibr" target="#b219">(Liaw &amp; Wiener, 2002)</ref> via MetaboAnalyst.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Ascertaining the provenance of an edible insect would allow for identification of products that have been sourced from geographical areas where an insect population might be under threat. I assessed the viability of an untargeted, GC-MS based approach to fingerprinting an edible insect, the larvae of P. reticularis, using two different derivatisation techniques. I used an untargeted GC-MS approach to create a metabolomic profile of 144 P. reticularis samples from six geographic locations along a latitudinal gradient. I identified 43 compounds using TMS derivatisation and 103 compounds using MCF derivatisation for a total of 146 compounds. I found that a RF model trained using the TMS derivatised metabolite profile had the highest accuracy, predicting the correct location of a sample 72.2 % of the time. In comparison, a RF model trained using the MCF derivatised data set had an accuracy of 68.1 %. I found that samples from one location, Kaingaroa, had a much lower accuracy in the model regardless of the derivatisation technique, suggesting that individuals sampled from this population had variable metabolite profiles that overlapped with that of other populations. Despite this, the PERMANOVA analysis found Kaingaroa to be significantly different from all other sites, except for Cheney's in the MCF data set. Whilst the RF model performed reasonably well, there is room for improvement. Future research comparing different classification models would assist with this. For example, models such as soft independent modelling by class analogy (SIMCA), support vector machine (SVM)</p><p>and linear discriminant analysis based on principal component analysis (PCA-LDA) yielded similar if not better results in the finger printing of hazelnuts <ref type="bibr" target="#b204">(Klockmann et al., 2016)</ref> There was considerable variation observed in the metabolomic profiles between individuals in the MCF data set (predominantly amino acids, fatty acids and organic acids) and there was little visible distinction between locations in the heatmap. I saw less variation between individuals in the TMS derivatised samples (predominantly sugars and sugar alcohols) and, visually, I was able to see some distinction between locations. This distinction was also visible in the PCA and was confirmed with PERMANOVA, with location explaining a greater amount of the variance in the TMS data than in the MCF data (31.1 % vs. 12.3 %). This suggests that TMS may be a better derivatisation technique than MCF for assessing differences between populations of P. reticularis.</p><p>I found several compounds whose relative abundance correlated with a north-south latitudinal gradient. Of particular interest were arabinose and urea, which are related to gut and metabolic activity. Urea is a nitrogenous waste product of metabolic processes in insects and arabinose is a five-carbon sugar that can be converted by gut bacteria into essential aromatic amino acids <ref type="bibr" target="#b332">(Scully et al., 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b331">(Scully et al., , 2014))</ref>. Both compounds had a negative correlation as latitude increased (i.e., became more southerly), and I propose that this relates to the activity levels of the insects along these gradients. The most southerly field sites, Flagstaff (Dunedin) and Seabush (Invercargill), were visited at the beginning of November, when it was still very cool, and the larvae were noticeably sluggish indicating a lack of feeding activity and most likely a lowered metabolic rate.</p><p>There are few studies investigating metabolomic variation along natural gradients. Arabidopsis lyrata ssp. petraea, a plant, has been shown to have significant natural variation in metabolism between locations, and exhibit adaptations to cold that are population specific along a latitudinal gradient (M. P. <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Davey et al., 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Davey et al., , 2009))</ref>. A decrease in the concentration of essential amino acids as latitude increased was found in a range-expanding mite, Tetranychus urticae, which was suggested to be due to reduced exploitation of resources at the margin of the organisms range, with lower feeding rates resulting in lower concentrations of EAA <ref type="bibr" target="#b377">(Van Petegem et al., 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Mannose and trehalose are two compounds with low molecular weights that are important for freeze tolerance in insects. Both of these compounds were found in high relative abundance in the samples. Larvae were collected over the course of November, a period where larval activity would be increasing following diapause. Cessation of diapause is believed to occur as mean temperatures increase <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">(Edwards, 1961b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b314">Rogers et al., 2002)</ref>. For Auckland, there is evidence this occurs around August and presumably later in the year at lower latitudes <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">(Edwards, 1961b)</ref>. Cold hardiness is likely to be important to the survival of diapausing P. reticularis, particularly in southern locations where below freezing temperatures can occur and this may explain the high levels of mannose and trehalose. The concentration of low molecular weight sugars and sugar alcohols has been shown to differ in concentration between geographical localities in another cerambycid species, suggesting that this may be linked to environmental temperature <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">(Feng et al., 2014)</ref>. Curiously, the P. reticularis larvae collected from the most southerly field site, Seabush, had the lowest levels of mannose and trehalose which is the opposite of what would be expected if these compounds are important for freeze tolerance.</p><p>Proline, followed by alanine, were the most abundant amino acids found in the larvae of P.</p><p>reticularis. Many insects are capable of oxidising proline for use as a fuel and most beetles use a combination of proline and carbohydrates for flight, whilst some beetle groups exclusively use proline for flight <ref type="bibr">(Auerswald, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr">Gäde, 1997a</ref><ref type="bibr">Gäde, , 1997b;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b135">Gäde &amp; Auerswald, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b357">Teulier et al., 2016)</ref>. In laminine cerambycids, both proline and glycogen are used by flight muscles <ref type="bibr" target="#b134">(Gäde &amp; Auerswald, 2000)</ref>. When proline is used by flight muscles, it undergoes partial oxidation resulting in the production of alanine which is then stored in the fat body and then used to re-synthesise proline <ref type="bibr" target="#b135">(Gäde &amp; Auerswald, 2002)</ref>. It is likely that the high abundance of these two amino acids is related to their importance in the metabolism of the larvae, and storage of these compounds will be important for the adult life stage which does not feed.</p><p>Future research could investigate how the metabolome varies temporally and with diet. The metabolomic fingerprint of a grub is likely to vary over time. It would be logical to next investigate how the metabolome alters at different stages of the season and life cycle, such as selecting larvae before, after and during diapause. This would help to validate the use of fingerprinting in assessing geographic provenance, whilst also providing insights into how the metabolome changes during different aspects of the life history of this species. I controlled for diet by only collecting larvae from pine logs, however, it is commonly held that the taste of P.</p><p>reticularis is "sweeter" when it has come from a matai log (pers. comms.). This suggest that diet may alter the compounds attributable to flavour in the larvae and presents an interesting future direction for research.</p><p>In summary, this study used an untargeted GC-MS method to characterise the metabolomic profile of P. reticularis along a latitudinal gradient. By utilising two derivatisation techniques, MCF and TMS, I was able to identify metabolites comprised of amino acids, organic acids, fatty acids, sugars, and sugar alcohols, and from these profiles predict which location a larvae came from with reasonable accuracy, with the TMS data set providing the greatest accuracy. I found compounds that correlated with a latitudinal gradient, offering insights into how environmental cues influence the metabolism of P. reticularis. Further investigation is required into the pattern I observed in sugars implicated in freeze tolerance, trehalose and mannose, which did not follow the environmental gradient I expected. Proline and alanine were prominent amino acids identified and this is likely indicative of their importance in the metabolism of both larval and adult life stages. This preliminary study presents opportunities for future research such as investigating a temporal gradient and the role of diet on the metabolomic fingerprint of this species.</p><p>Chapter 5 The static allometry of traits associated with fitness in Prionoplus reticularis (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Abstract</head><p>Scramble competition mating systems are characterised by intense competition among males to locate and mate with females. Despite the prevalence of scramble competitions in nature, little is known about how selection influences male traits important for scramble competition, and their patterns of sexual dimorphism and allometry. The mating system of the cerambycid Prionoplus reticularis exhibits the hallmarks of a scramble competition so I set out to determine the degree of sexual dimorphism and patterns of allometry in traits predicted to be important in scramble competition: body size, wing size and antennal size. I also assessed the influence of body size and wing traits on locomotory performance in male huhu using a flight mill. I observed pronounced sexual dimorphism between male and female individuals across all measured traits, with the exception of wing aspect ratio. Female traits were consistently larger on average than males, with the exception of the antennae. Male antennae were significantly larger on average than female antennae which suggests sexual selection has generated longer antennae but smaller body size in males. I did not observe positive allometry for any male or female traits. Females showed negative allometry in antennal length, wing aspect ratio, and wing loading whilst all other traits exhibited isometry. In contrast, all male traits demonstrated negative allometry, except for wing loading which was isometric. This suggests that whilst sexual selection is likely driving sexual dimorphism, larger males do not benefit from disproportionate investment in wings or antennae.</p><p>Instead, stabilising selection likely generates the negative allometries of traits I observed, possibly due to biomechanical constraints. In the three areas of flight performance I explored, I discovered that wing loading was significant and positive, suggesting that as wing loading increases, so too does flight distance, duration and speed. This result suggests that relatively heavier males may have the energetic reserves to fly faster and for longer, contrary to studies of other taxa. Overall, I highlight the study of patterns of trait investment in scramble competitors as a potentially fruitful avenue of further research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Scramble competition mating systems are characterized by intense competition among males to locate and mate with females, then continue to move through the environment investing in mate acquisition rather than defence (S. T. <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">Emlen &amp; Oring, 1977;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b170">Herberstein et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b358">Thornhill &amp; Alcock, 1983)</ref>. Such mating systems often involve little courtship, but high levels of multiple mating by both males and females, and therefore a high degree of sperm competition. Mating systems dominated by scramble competition are likely to be very common in the animal kingdom <ref type="bibr" target="#b170">(Herberstein et al., 2017)</ref>. Despite this, the way that selection influences male traits involved in scramble competition is less well-understood, than for more dramatic mating systems such as leks, and those that involve male defence of females or their critical resources <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">(Emberts et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b120">M.

Among these more well-studied mating systems, significant research attention has focused on sexual dimorphism, allometry and the selective benefit of male signals, conspicuous ornaments, and exaggerated weaponry <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Bonduriansky, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Bonduriansky &amp; Day, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">Eberhard et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b236">McCullough &amp; O'Brien, 2022)</ref>. In contrast, less is known about how selection influences male traits important for scramble competition, and their patterns of sexual dimorphism and allometry.</p><p>Due to the importance of locating mates, sometimes over long distances, strong selection on sensory traits in males is predicted under scramble competition <ref type="bibr" target="#b358">(Thornhill &amp; Alcock, 1983)</ref>.</p><p>Darwin predicted that sexual selection should influence the evolution of the 'organs of sense' in much the same way as for ornaments and weapons <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Darwin, 1871;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b111">Elgar et al., 2019)</ref>. He proposed that males with sense organs better able to detect females should find and mate with more females and these traits would be selected for. This is particularly the case among scrambling species and higher investment in the size and sensitivity of male sense organs such as eyes, ears and antennae has been demonstrated for many species (reviewed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b170">Herberstein et al., 2017)</ref>. For example, most male moths show longer and more elaborate (pectinate) antennae than females <ref type="bibr" target="#b352">(Symonds et al., 2012)</ref>, and the number and density of olfactory antennal sensilla have been shown to be higher for males in a wide range of insect species including mantises, beetles, stick insects, flies and moths <ref type="bibr" target="#b172">(Holwell et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b189">Jourdan et al., 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b233">Mark et al., 2018</ref>; S. S. <ref type="bibr" target="#b258">Myers et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b409">F. Zhang et al., 2021)</ref>.

Evidence for a functional relationship between sensory trait size and mating success or the ability to locate mates is however, rare. Where it has been established, research has shown that male Pseudomantis albofimbriata (Mantodea) with more trichoid sensilla (a chemosensory sensilla) were able to find females quicker <ref type="bibr" target="#b184">(Jayaweera &amp; Barry, 2017)</ref> and Uraba lugens (Lepidoptera) males arriving at a trap containing a single female had on average larger antennae compared to a trap containing two females indicating that larger antennae provided an advantage in finding weaker sensory cues <ref type="bibr" target="#b187">(Johnson et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Just as males who can better detect females will be selected for under scramble competition, those who can move more quickly or cover wider distances in search of females, are predicted to have higher mating success <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Able, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Andersson, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b178">Husak &amp; Fox, 2008)</ref>. Locomotion and investment in locomotory traits are known to differ between males and females, often to extremes such as in cases where females are sedentary (e.g. many spiders, <ref type="bibr" target="#b153">Grossi &amp; Canals, 2015)</ref> and lack means of dispersal (e.g. flightless female mantises <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Barry et al., 2011</ref><ref type="bibr">), moths (Niitsu et al., 2017)</ref> and stick insects <ref type="bibr" target="#b408">(Zeng et al., 2020)</ref> when compared to more mobile and winged males.</p><p>Giant wētā are one of the best studied groups with males with longer legs relative to their body size being more mobile resulting in higher mating success <ref type="bibr" target="#b200">(Kelly et al., 2008)</ref>. In dragonflies, sexual selection has been shown to act on flight endurance rather than speed with larger wings and increased fat reserves leading to greater endurance and higher mating success <ref type="bibr" target="#b155">(Gyulavári et al., 2014)</ref>.</p><p>In flying species, the morphology of wings are correlated with performance allowing wing metrics, such as aspect ratio and wing loading, to be used as predictors of locomotive ability <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Berwaerts et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b140">Gibb et al., 2006)</ref>. Aspect ratio is a metric that represents the relationship between length and width (or area) of a wing, with a high ratio characterized by a longer, thinner wing suited to fast, agile flight (e.g. dragonflies), and a low aspect ratio indicating a shorter, broader wing suited to slow gliding flight (e.g. butterflies) <ref type="bibr" target="#b131">(Fu et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b215">Le Roy et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b400">Wootton, 2020)</ref>. Wing loading describes the relationship of body mass to wing area with the energy efficiency of flight increasing as wing loading decreases <ref type="bibr" target="#b140">(Gibb et al., 2006)</ref>. In noctuid moths, individuals reared in a nutrient poor environment display developmental plasticity with lower than predicted body weights and lower wing loading ratios suggesting an adaptive response tailored to lowering the energetic costs associated with flight <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Angelo &amp; Slansky, 1984)</ref>.</p><p>Body size is more complex and it seems that how scramble competition influences male body size depends on its relationship with locomotion <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Andersson, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b139">Ghiselin, 1974)</ref>. In a scramble competition mating system, an individual's reproductive success may be impacted by traits such as energy efficiency, endurance, mobility, manoeuvrability, agility, and aerial ability. If body size interacts with these traits, then selection pressure will lead to sexual size dimorphism (SSD) where one sex will be smaller or larger than the other. For small male SSD, several hypotheses have been put forward to explain this phenomenon. The Ghiselin -Reiss small-male hypothesis proposes that smaller males have an advantage in mate searching as they require less energy per unit of time of mate searching and therefore require less time having to replenish energy through foraging and can spend more time searching for mates <ref type="bibr" target="#b139">(Ghiselin, 1974;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b170">Herberstein et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b305">Reiss, 1989)</ref>. This has been documented in the water strider, Aquarius remigis, where smaller males had greater mating success in a food limited environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Blanckenhorn et al., 1995)</ref>. In species where smaller or lighter males might benefit from increased locomotor speed or endurance (e.g. flying species, spiders that climb to females), it is predicted that selection will reduce male body size relative to that of females, and relative to locomotor traits such as wing area and leg length <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Crompton et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b155">Gyulavári et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b253">Moya-Laraño et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b385">Vollrath &amp; Parker, 1992)</ref>.</p><p>In species where larger bodied males can move faster or have more energy reserves to cover more distance or roam for longer periods, then larger bodies are likely to be selected for. For example, in some spider species, larger males are associated with greater mating success <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Brandt &amp; Andrade, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b125">Foellmer &amp; Fairbairn, 2005)</ref> which is suggested to be due to a locomotor advantage on horizontal substrates <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Brandt &amp; Andrade, 2007)</ref>, whilst in the cerambycid Phoracantha semipunctata, larger males are able to walk faster and have a greater antennae span, leading to higher mating success through covering a greater area during mate searching <ref type="bibr" target="#b163">(Hanks et al., 1996)</ref>.</p><p>Allometry is the study of the scaling relationship between a trait of interest and body size. It has been broadly classified into ontogenetic, evolutionary and static allometry. Ontogenetic allometry encompasses changes in trait and body size over different developmental stages, evolutionary allometry refers to the relationship between body and trait size among species, and static allometry (henceforth referred to as allometry), refers to how a trait correlates with size among individuals of the same developmental stage and species <ref type="bibr" target="#b203">(Klingenberg &amp; Zimmermann, 1992)</ref>.</p><p>Allometry is represented as the mathematical expression 𝑦𝑦 = 𝑏𝑏𝑥𝑥 𝑎𝑎 which relates a trait of interest, 𝑦𝑦, to a measure of body size of an organism, 𝑥𝑥, with the y-axis intercept represented as 𝑏𝑏 and the slope, of particular interest to evolutionary biologists, estimated as 𝑎𝑎 <ref type="bibr" target="#b180">(Huxley, 1924)</ref>.</p><p>The slope of the line can be classified as being positively allometric (𝑎𝑎 &gt; 1), negatively allometric (𝑎𝑎 &lt; 1), or isometric (𝑎𝑎 = 1) <ref type="bibr" target="#b181">(Huxley &amp; Teissier, 1936)</ref>. This is of interest when considering how the size of a trait of interest, for example antennae, scales between with body size amongst individuals of a species. If, after measuring a sample of individuals, I find that the relationship between antennal length and body size is greater than one (i.e. 𝑎𝑎 &gt; 1), this is described as positive allometry and I can infer that larger individuals are investing disproportionately in that trait in comparison to smaller individuals.</p><p>Many traits under sexual selection have been shown to exhibit positive allometry. Both ornaments and weapons frequently scale positively with body size in males, but not females <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Dale et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b115">D. J. Emlen, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b311">Rico-Guevara &amp; Hurme, 2019</ref>; but see <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Bonduriansky, 2007)</ref>. In contrast, genitalia and sexually selected contact structures involved in courtship show negative allometry, due to the functional constraints of successful male-female interaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">(Eberhard, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Eberhard et al., 1998)</ref>. It is unclear how sensory and locomotory traits under sexual selection will scale with body size. The pattern of allometry for any traits represents the variation in the marginal fitness gains that individuals of different sizes receive by investing more or less in those traits <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Bonduriansky &amp; Day, 2003)</ref>. Therefore, for sensory or locomotory traits, if larger individuals stand to gain fitness benefits from investing in the development of disproportionately larger antennae or wings, then I would predict positive allometry to evolve.</p><p>However, there are likely to be strong functional and biomechanical constraints that curtail exaggeration. For example, larger wing length or area is likely to only provide additional locomotor performance up to a point, where mobility would then be reduced with further exaggeration <ref type="bibr" target="#b128">(Frankino et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b302">Rayner, 1988)</ref>. Such constraints might drive the evolution of negative allometry, or lead to no deviation from isometry.</p><p>The huhu beetle, Prionoplus reticularis (Cerambycidae: Prioninae), is an iconic New Zealand long horned beetle whose larvae feed on the dead and decaying wood of certain native and exotic tree species <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">(Edwards, 1959)</ref>. The sex ratio of adult beetles is roughly 1:1, however light trapping is biased towards male capture <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">(Edwards, 1956</ref><ref type="bibr">(Edwards, , 1961c))</ref>. The adult beetle is large, short lived and non-feeding, living for around two weeks upon the energy reserves accrued from its two to three year xylophagous larval stage <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">(Edwards, 1961b</ref><ref type="bibr">(Edwards, , 1961c))</ref>. Upon emergence, the female produces a male attracting pheromone setting up the conditions for a scramble competition mating system where males try to find spatially dispersed females to mate with within a finite time period determined by their energy reserves. There is also a report of P. reticularis males engaging in combat displays with other males, where the display escalates through several stages to grappling with the fore legs until one individual is thrown onto its back <ref type="bibr">(Edwards, 1961c)</ref>.</p><p>I set out to (1) determine the degree of sexual dimorphism in measures of body size, wing size and antennal size for P. reticularis., (2) determine the patterns of allometry for sensory (antennae length, ninth flagellomere length), locomotory (wing length, wing area, wing aspect ratio and wing loading) and combat (tibia and femur) traits for P. reticularis and, (3) assess the influence of body size and wing traits on locomotory performance in huhu using a flight mill. Specifically, for</p><p>(2) I predict that positive allometries indicative of sexual selection will exist in male traits optimized for detecting females quickly (chemosensory structures i.e., antennae), traits that improve male mobility (locomotory traits i.e., wing size including wing aspect ratio and loading)</p><p>and positive selection on traits that improve combat ability in males (grappling ability, i.e., femur and tibia length of fore legs).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Field site and Collection</head><p>I collected adult huhu beetles (n = 112) from Riverhead Forest, Auckland, New Zealand using a mercury vapour light at night between November 2021 and February 2022. Individuals were stored in ventilated plastic specimen jars with a piece of cardboard for beetles to gain purchase and rest. Upon return, each individual had half a staple super glued to the pronotum which allowed for easy attachment to flight mill via a magnet. To identify each individual, a number was written on the left elytron using acrylic paint (Molotow Extra Fine 1mm Pen). Individuals were acclimatised in the dark at room temperature for 1 hour before being attached to flight mills. The weight of each individual was taken before attachment to a flight mill using a milligram scale (8028 Series, Guangzhou Juanjuan Electronic Technology Co., Ltd.). After flight mill tests (see below), individuals were then placed into a freezer and traits of interest were dissected, attached to graph paper and digitised using a flatbed scanner (HP Envy 5000 series).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measurements of Morphological Traits</head><p>Traits of interest were measured using ImageJ (NIH, 1.50i). The locations of linear measurements taken is visualised in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_56">29</ref>. I measured total body length (from mandibles to tip of left elytron, mm), pronotum width (between two pairs of pronotal spines, mm), femur length (along ventral edge, between proximal bend and distal femoral spur), tibia length (along ventral edge, between proximal bend and distal tibial spur), antennal segment length (pedicel, scape, flagellomere 1 to 9), total antenna length (sum of antennal segments), elytron length (from base of integument to distal end of medial suture) and hind wing length (henceforth called wing length, humeral plate to distal end of radial anterior 4), wing area (calculated by tracing the wing edge in ImageJ and measuring area). For wing aspect ratio (2(𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑙𝑙ℎ) 2 / 𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤 𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑙𝑙𝑎𝑎) and wing loading (𝑤𝑤𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑦𝑦 𝑚𝑚𝑎𝑎𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚/2(𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤 𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑙𝑙𝑎𝑎)), I doubled the wing area and wing length to account for only measuring a single wing. All measurements were taken from the right-hand side of the insect where possible (if damaged, the left-hand side was used). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Flight Mill Design</head><p>Six flight mills were constructed and attached to a microprocessor (Arduino Uno Revision 3) to record flight information (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_57">30</ref>). A 3D printer was used to produce the shaft and arms of each flight mill from polylactic acid (PLA). The axis upon which the flight mill arm pivots was comprised of a polyethylene pipette tip inserted into a 0.5 ml polyethylene Eppendorf tube, this material has very low friction, allowing for the arm to rotate freely (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_57">30 B</ref>). The flight mill arm was placed over the Eppendorf tube. To extend the length of the arms, stiff paper clip wire was attached to either end. To allow for ease of attachment specimens, a neodymium magnet was attached to the end of the extended flight mill arm which would then be attracted to the half-staple attached to the pronotum of the beetles (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_57">30 D</ref>). At the end of the opposite flight mill arm, a plasticine counterweight of the specimen was attached (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_57">30 A</ref>).</p><p>Each flight mill had a hall effect sensor (Honeywell 2SS52M Omnipolar Hall Effect Sensor) coupled with a 10K ohms pull-up resistor and 5V power supply attached to the shaft (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_57">30</ref> E). On the flight mill arm, close to the axis, a neodymium magnet was secured with epoxy resin, close to the centre of the axis (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_57">30 C</ref>). Each flight mill was connected to the same microprocessor using single core, flexible flat cable. A high precision real time clock (RTC) module was connected to the microprocessor along with a micro-SD card reader module. The microprocessor was programmed using Arduino programming language, a C++ variant. The schematics for the electronic components are presented in Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_33">33</ref>.</p><p>Upon each rotation of the flight mill arm, the magnetic field of the neodymium magnet causes the hall effect sensor to complete an electrical circuit, sending a signal to the microprocessor to record the flight mill identification number (1 -6) and time (both UNIX and POSIX format) to a text file on the micro-SD card. For example, if a rotation was completed on flight mill three at 0013h on the 26th of January 2022, it would be recorded as follows:</p><p>3, 1643156007, 2022-01-26T00:13:27 123 </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Processing</head><p>Flight mill data were cleaned using R 4.2.3 (R Core Team, 2022) and the tidyverse ecosystem (H. <ref type="bibr" target="#b396">Wickham et al., 2019)</ref>. I attached n = 103 P. reticularis to flight mills, producing 4,018,162 data points from n = 68 individuals. Firstly, I removed any data points that had been recorded with an incorrect date stamp i.e., occurring outside of the experimentation period (44 data points). I then grouped all responses by date and time and summarised to provide the number of revolutions per second (rps), providing 176,121 data points. In some instances, an individual would cease flying over the top of the hall-effect sensor, causing the sensor to stay in an on position, leading to abnormally high revolutions per second. To account for this, I filmed five individuals (n = 5) and recorded maximum revolutions per second, taking the highest value (1.6 rps), I then doubled this value and filtered out any results greater than 3 rps resulting in a final amount of 23,876 data points for analysis from n = 55 individuals.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical Analysis and Software</head><p>Allometry I used the power function 𝑦𝑦 = 𝛼𝛼𝑋𝑋 𝛽𝛽 where 𝑦𝑦 is the trait of interest, 𝑋𝑋 is pronotum width, α is the intercept and β is the slope <ref type="bibr" target="#b180">(Huxley, 1924)</ref>. I linearised this by log transformation to log 10 𝑦𝑦 = log 10 𝛽𝛽 + 𝛼𝛼 log 10 𝑋𝑋 which allowed the use of an ordinary least squares (OLS) linear regression to fit a line to the data, estimate the slope and intercept and perform a test to assess for deviation from isometry (𝛼𝛼 ≠ 1) using the smatr package <ref type="bibr" target="#b393">(Warton et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr">version 3.4-8)</ref>. There has been debate regarding the appropriateness of different regression methods used in evolutionary biology, with OLS at risk of underestimating allometric slopes if there is measurement error in body size measurements. However, this bias is negligible when measurement error is low and OLS is still viewed as preferable in comparison with other methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b201">(Kilmer &amp; Rodríguez, 2017)</ref>.</p><p>To account for this, all measurements were taken by a single researcher (NWB), and I thrice repeated measurements of traits on 20 individuals to ensure that measurement error was low. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>In my investigation of sexual dimorphism in P. reticularis, I observed pronounced differences between male and female individuals across all measured traits, with the exception of wing aspect ratio. Female traits were consistently larger on average than males, with the exception of the antennae. Male antennae were significantly larger on average than female antennae which suggests sexual selection is acting on antennal length. Contrary to my initial hypothesis, an analysis of trait allometries did not reveal the positive allometry that is frequently used to infer the influence of sexual selection <ref type="bibr" target="#b207">(Kodric-Brown et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr">but see Bonduriansky, 2007)</ref>.</p><p>Females showed negative allometry in antennal length, wing aspect ratio, and wing loading whilst all other traits exhibited isometry. In contrast, all male traits demonstrated negative allometry, except for wing loading which adhered to isometry. In the three areas of flight performance I explored, I discovered that wing loading was significant and positive, suggesting that as wing loading increases, so too does distance, duration and speed. As P. reticularis does not feed as an adult, the single objective of males is to mate with females which presents a fascinating study system to explore importance of different traits to success in a scramble competition mating system.</p></div>

D. Wickham et al., 2016)</ref>. Increased antennal size/surface area has been associated with male fitness, improving the ability to detect weaker signals from females in Lepidoptera <ref type="bibr" target="#b187">(Johnson et al., 2017)</ref>. The observed elongation of male antennae in P. reticularis therefore may represent the optimising of mate-searching efficiency in this species.</p><p>Antennae are important sensory receptors, that are likely to be under different selective pressures. Directional selection is likely to have driven the increase in male antennal length compared to females. However, antennal length in both sexes of P. reticularis exhibited negative allometry suggesting that stabilising selection is occurring in both sexes, driving negative allometry. It appears that there is an interplay between directional and stabilising selection and I suggest that directional selection on the males is occurring within the constraints of stabilising selection as the allometric slope is very similar in both sexes (Male β = 0.769 &amp; female β = 0.787).</p><p>The interplay of different selective pressures is likely very important in determining the maximum length or area of the antennae. As antennae provide information vital to male fitness they are likely to be under strong directional selection e.g., longer, pectinate antennae in males to detect chemosensory information on chemical cues involved in mate searching <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Cardé, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b187">Johnson et al., 2017)</ref>. This selection frequently leads to spectacular antennal morphologies which increase the fitness of the individual. However, there must be a trade-off; otherwise, I might expect the antennae to become even longer or with even greater surface area. This trade-off is likely to be one of aerodynamics, with drag increasing with antennal surface area resulting in greater energetic costs <ref type="bibr" target="#b183">(Jaffar-Bandjee et al., 2020)</ref> and imparting a stabilising selective pressure leading to negative allometry. I conducted several laboratory experiments to determine the strength of olfactory response in males to female cues, however I was unsuccessful in eliciting mating behaviour in artificial conditions, indicating that unknown environmental factors may be important in this mating system. Future research would benefit from conducting field trials to explore and quantify behavioural responses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Locomotory Traits</head><p>Morphological traits associated with dispersal (wing length and wing area) displayed negative allometry in males and isometry in females. Negative allometry in male wing traits is a pattern seen in several other beetle groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b195">(Kawano, 1995</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b196">(Kawano, , 1997;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b199">Kelly, 2022)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b198">Kelly (2020)</ref> found that small body size and larger wing size in males, led to greater mating success in Popillia japonica.</p><p>However, this did not translate to positive allometry for wing area in this species, instead negative allometry was present with stabilising selection proposed to be at play on this trait <ref type="bibr" target="#b199">(Kelly, 2022)</ref>.</p><p>I found that flight performance (distance, duration and speed) increased with wing loading, but body size and wing aspect ratio did not influence flight performance. Increased wing loading is associated with higher wingbeat frequency, an increase in airspeed but a decrease in energetic efficiency suggesting the sustainability of flight is lower <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Byrne et al., 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Dudley, 1999)</ref>.</p><p>Different wing loading has been shown to be intimately related with defensive strategies in Neotropical butterflies, with species with high wing loadings relying on speed to escape predators, whilst species with low wing loadings fly in a slow and jaunty fashion relying on aposematism to avoid predation <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Chai &amp; Srygley, 1990)</ref>. Therefore, the benefits to flight performance received from high wing loading values are likely to result in increased male fitness by maximising the number of females a male can get to. Whilst endurance (sustainability of flight) has been posited to be important and thus favour lower wing loading values, this likely depends on the spatial distribution of the female population <ref type="bibr" target="#b178">(Husak &amp; Fox, 2008)</ref>. If females are located within a short distance of one another, then speed is likely to be a more important factor <ref type="bibr" target="#b198">(Kelly, 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Aspect ratio is important for agility and manoeuvrability. However, I did not see evidence of sexual dimorphism for this trait and it was not significant in the flight performance models.</p><p>Aspect ratio had the lowest coefficient of variation (CV) of all of the traits I measured (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_21">14</ref>)</p><p>suggesting that this trait may be very constrained across body sizes. On the other hand, wing loading and body mass had the highest CV of traits measured, this suggests a great deal of variation within the sample population which is likely due to the differing ages of individuals. As the fat reserves of an individual are finite, the mass of the organism will decrease over time as these reserves are depleted whilst the wing area remains the same size. Wing loading will therefore decrease with age for each individual, resulting in more efficient flight over time but with a decrease in flight performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Body size</head><p>I found evidence for female-biased sexual size dimorphism (SSD) in P. reticularis, with males exhibiting significantly smaller and lighter body size compared to females. Small body size in males is thought to be beneficial in scramble competition, increasing their mobility and/or endurance <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Andersson, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b139">Ghiselin, 1974;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b170">Herberstein et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b200">Kelly et al., 2008)</ref>. One theoretical framework that may explain this is the Ghiselin-Reiss small-male hypothesis which suggests that in species exhibiting a scramble competition mating system, smaller males have a selective advantage in acquiring mates <ref type="bibr" target="#b139">(Ghiselin, 1974;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b305">Reiss, 1989)</ref>. The advantage is derived from a trade-off between allocating time and energy from feeding to mate searching. Smaller males, which require less energy per unit of time, can dedicate more time to energetically costly mate searching instead of seeking food, thus increasing the chance of encountering and mating with females.</p><p>In the context of female-biased SSD observed in P. reticularis, the Ghiselin-Reiss hypothesis provides a possible explanation. As the adults do not feed, instead surviving on larval energy reserves, a lower body size should increase the energy efficiency of flight. Flight efficiency is related to wing loading, a biomechanical variable relating wing surface area to body mass, with a lower wing loading value corresponding to increased flight efficiency, and a higher wing loading values associated with faster flight and higher body temperatures (indicating a greater loss of energy through heat) <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Chai &amp; Srygley, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Dudley, 1999)</ref>. Smaller, lighter males (in comparison to females) have a lower wing loading value decreasing the energy required for flight allowing for more efficient use of the finite energy supply thereby extending the length of time available to find spatially dispersed females.</p><p>Females are significantly heavier than males, and this was reflected in their larger wing loading value indicating a lower efficiency when flying. However, as mate searching is not required for the female, instead relying on a chemical cue to attract males, flying efficiency is less likely to be an issue other than when finding an oviposition site. This indicates that selection pressure is occurring on males but does not appear to be acting upon females and this drives the sexual dimorphism I saw.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Scramble competition and the selective pressures at play</head><p>Male success in scramble competition is governed by the rate at which they find and mate with females. Therefore, I predicted that as for male weapons and ornaments, positive allometry would be evident in sensory and locomotory traits. I did not find evidence of this, instead finding that all male traits of interest exhibited negative allometry. This suggests that the traits do not play a purely sexual function; traits with both sexual and non-sexual functions typically demonstrate isometry or negative allometry as observed here <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Bonduriansky, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b130">Fromhage &amp; Kokko, 2014)</ref>.</p><p>In scramble competition, male fitness is linked to finding and mating with as many females as possible <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Andersson, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b139">Ghiselin, 1974;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b170">Herberstein et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b358">Thornhill &amp; Alcock, 1983)</ref> and has led to spectacular examples of sexual dimorphism such as the wingless, sedentary females in several species of bag moth relying on pheromones to attract males <ref type="bibr">(Niitsu et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b310">Rhainds et al., 2008)</ref>. In the case of P. reticularis, the female is fairly sedentary, attracting mates with a chemical cue and flying only when finding an oviposition site. This, combined with finite energy reserves, places selective pressure on male locomotory and mate searching traits.</p><p>One reason I might see negative allometry rather than positive allometry is that small males may be investing disproportionately in wing length and area as it provides an increase in marginal fitness gain for small males whilst larger males do not see a marginal fitness gain by investing further in wings, perhaps being constrained by a biomechanical or developmental constraint. A developmental constraint is a limitation or restriction that is imposed by the processes of development on the range of possible phenotypes that can evolve in a population <ref type="bibr" target="#b128">(Frankino et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b338">Smith et al., 1985)</ref>. However, determining the relative role of selection and developmental constraints is challenging without experimentally manipulating trait and assessing changes in fitness. <ref type="bibr" target="#b128">Frankino et al. (2005)</ref> artificially altered the wing loading in a population of butterflies by selecting for differences in fore wing area. Over several generations this led to different allometries between the experimental group and the wild-type control. The wild-type were observed to have greater fitness, mating more frequently with females. This showed that the short-term evolution of new allometries was not limited by developmental constraints, instead natural selection appears to be exhibiting strong stabilising selection on male wing loading in this species.</p><p>In summary, my investigation provides evidence for selective pressures on traits associated with fitness in a scramble competition mating system. Most traits examined demonstrated femalebiased sexual dimorphism apart from antennal length which showed strong male-bias indicating the importance of detecting female chemical cues to male fitness. I did not find positive allometry indicative of sexual selection. Instead, negative allometry was prevalent in several traits, suggesting the influence of stabilizing selection. Wing loading was positively correlated with flight speed, distance, and duration. My findings provide insights into the trade-offs and constraints influencing the evolution of sexual dimorphism in P. reticularis, highlighting the need for future investigation, such as using artificial selection to tease apart and fully understand the dynamics at play.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>An animal's perception of its surroundings is vital for its survival and reproduction, and for insects the antennae fulfil a key role in reception of sensory cues to inform its behavioural decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">(Elgar et al., 2018)</ref>. Antennae can be host to a variety of ultrastructures involved in mechanoreception, hygroreception, and thermoreception but are particularly associated with chemoreception (D. <ref type="bibr" target="#b326">Schneider, 1964)</ref>. Chemoreception relates to the detection of chemical cues in the environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b404">(Zacharuk, 1980)</ref> and many insects are particularly influenced by such cues <ref type="bibr" target="#b353">(Szyszka &amp; Galizia, 2015)</ref>, using them to locate host plants or prey <ref type="bibr" target="#b138">(Geier et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b275">Paschen et al., 2012)</ref>, make decisions about food quality <ref type="bibr" target="#b167">(Haverkamp et al., 2016)</ref>, choose appropriate habitats and oviposition sites <ref type="bibr" target="#b275">(Paschen et al., 2012)</ref>, avoid predators <ref type="bibr" target="#b191">(Kannan et al., 2022)</ref> and locate and select mates <ref type="bibr" target="#b186">(Johansson &amp; Jones, 2007)</ref>. Chemoreception can be further categorised into olfaction, analogous to smell, the perception of volatile molecules in the air, while gustation, analogous to taste, is the detection of non-volatile chemicals from surfaces (B. H. <ref type="bibr" target="#b202">King &amp; Gunathunga, 2023)</ref>. Whilst the antennae are comprised of just three units; the basal scape and pedicel, and a flagellum, these can be readily modified as reflected in the incredible diversity in antennal morphologies across insect taxa <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">(Elgar et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>The basic sensory unit of the antennae is a sensillum, which is an innervated ultrastructure comprised of sensory nerve cells, trichogen and tormogen cells, and sometimes auxiliary cells (D. <ref type="bibr" target="#b326">Schneider, 1964)</ref>. Sensilla have been classified according to their structural morphology (e.g., peg and socket, hair, dome), wall thickness (e.g., thin walled, thick walled, single walled, double walled), presence and distribution of pores (e.g., terminal pore, wall pore, aporous, uniporous, multiporous, pitted, grooved) and innervation (e.g., number of sensory nerve cells, dendritic branching) <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Altner &amp; Prillinger, 1980)</ref>. Whilst it is problematic to label the function of a sensilla based on its morphology without supporting electrophysiological evidence, there are sometimes clues which can help us to provide a tentative role to a sensillum type; for instance many chemosensory sensilla will usually have pores visible in the cuticle, through which odour molecules pass <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Altner &amp; Prillinger, 1980)</ref>.</p><p>Darwin suggested that sexual selection, through female mate choice, could explain the seemingly bizarre array of traits that appear in some animal species, e.g., the "gorgeous plumage and strange antics" of male birds in attracting a mate <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Darwin, 1859)</ref> that would seem conspicuous to predators and at odds with natural selection. Sensory traits that improve the ability of males to discover females were also postulated by Darwin to be under the influence of sexual selection <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Darwin, 1871)</ref>, but these have largely remained unstudied in the context of recent sexual selection research ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">(Elgar et al., 2018)</ref>. The reproductive benefit of finding a mate first can explain selection for longer antennae. For example, male Uraba lugens moths arriving at a trap containing a single female had, on average, longer antennae than males arriving at a trap containing two females, suggesting that longer antennae length improves the receptive ability of males to find a female pheromone plume at lower concentration <ref type="bibr" target="#b187">(Johnson et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p>In species of insects that rely on female sex pheromones to attract mates, I frequently observe sexual dimorphism in the antennae. This may be obviously visible through an increase in antennal surface area through length of antennae and branching of the flagella, or, less visible to the human eye, through differences in the sensilla on the antenna <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">(Elgar et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Morphology, density and distribution of sensilla have been shown to differ across a variety of insect orders. In the Mantodea, female sex pheromones are used by Pseudomantis albofimbriata as sensory cues in mate finding, whilst Ciulfina biseriata uses visual cues <ref type="bibr" target="#b172">(Holwell et al., 2007)</ref>.</p><p>Sensilla basiconica, associated with olfaction, are only present on the antennae of males of P.</p><p>albofimbriata. In contrast, C. biseriata, which used vision in mate searching, did not exhibit sensilla basiconica or dimorphism in the antennae <ref type="bibr" target="#b172">(Holwell et al., 2007)</ref>. Pheromones are well known in the Lepidoptera, and sexual dimorphism in antennal morphology is, unsurprisingly, common. Differences in the density and distribution of sensilla between sexes have been attributed to differences in importance of different sensory cues, e.g. female sex pheromones for males and host plant volatiles in females <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Castrejón-Gómez et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b164">Hansson et al., 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b233">Mark et al., 2018)</ref>. Female produced sex pheromones appear to explain sexual dimorphism exhibited in Clitarchus hookeri (Phamatodea) with increased density of sensilla basiconica and sensilla trichodea, sensilla associated with olfaction, present in males (S. S. <ref type="bibr" target="#b258">Myers et al., 2015)</ref>. In some cases, the driver of sexual dimorphism of antennal ultrastructures can be less clear. This is the case with two species of closely related cave wētā (Orthoptera), Pachyrhamma waitomoensis and P. acanthocera. Several sensilla subtypes associated with chemoreception are absent in male P. waitomoensis that are not absent in male P. acanthocera, which may be due to differences in the structural complexity of the respective species' habitats (M. P. <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">Fea et al., 2019)</ref>.</p><p>Distinctive long antennae are a characteristic feature of cerambycid beetles, giving rise to their common name -long horn beetles <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Allison et al., 2004)</ref>. Typically, the antennae are filiform, however in some instances, these antennae may be strikingly modified, with comb-like flabellate flagellomeres, densely setose segments and, in one instance, a modified terminal flagellomere to form a venomous stinger <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Berkov et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b390">Q. Wang et al., 2017)</ref>. Sexual dimorphism is common in the cerambycids, and this is often most pronounced in the antennae with males having longer antennae than females. This suggests that there may be sexual differences in the sensilla present on the antennae which allow for the detection of chemical cues of differing importance to each sex.</p><p>Within the cerambycids, there are seven major types of sensilla present on the antenna (recently standardised in <ref type="bibr" target="#b156">Haddad et al., 2023)</ref> which are: Böhm bristles, sensilla chaetica, chemosensory hairs (this term is used for any large, porous, hair-like sensilla i.e., sensilla trichodea and porous sensilla chaetica which have been used interchangeably in the literature), sensilla basiconica, dome shaped organs, sensilla coeloconica, and sensilla auricillica.

Images were taken of each segment of the antennae, from the scape to the ninth flagellomere.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measurements</head><p>SEM Images were analysed in ImageJ v. 1.50i (C. A. <ref type="bibr" target="#b325">Schneider et al., 2012)</ref>. Following the methodology of <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">Fea et al. (2019)</ref>, I measured length of sensilla from the base to the apex, the width of base, width of tip and socket width for sensilla in both sexes (2 female individuals and 4 male individuals). The mean and standard error are reported.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Terminology</head><p>Ultrastructures were classified based on their morphology, insertion, surface features, porosity (porous or aporous) and location of pores (wall or terminal pore). For ease of comparison, I use the sensilla naming conventions outlined by previous authors, in particular the recent review of cerambycid antennal ultrastructures by <ref type="bibr" target="#b156">Haddad et al. (2023)</ref> who standardised the sensilla of cerambycids into the following broad categories: Böhm bristles, sensilla chaetica, chemosensory hairs, sensilla basiconica, dome shaped organs, sensilla coeloconica, and sensilla auricillica. These categories were further subdivided into subcategories. <ref type="bibr" target="#b156">Haddad et al. (2023)</ref> prioritised the terminology of <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Dyer and Seabrook (1975)</ref> who were first to publish on cerambycid antennal ultrastructure morphology, whilst also using the terminology of <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Altner and Prillinger (1980)</ref> to replace the inconsistent use of suspected chemosensory sensilla chaetica and sensilla trichodea found in the literature with the terminology "wall-pore hairs" and "terminal-pore hairs". I use the term sensilla filiformia from <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">Faucheux (2011)</ref> to describe the long, ciliated sensilla which are prevalent in the male specimens examined.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>The whole antennae of the adult male and female P. reticularis are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_61">34</ref> A &amp; B. The male and female antennae are both serrate and comprised of the scape, pedicel and nine flagellomeres. The surface of the antennae is covered in cuticular scales that are roughly hexagonal in shape with the exception of the base of the scape and the pedicel where it inserts into the head and scape. The scape is cylindrical, with a slight kink on the lateral surface. The pedicel is pocillovous in shape, constricted at the mid-point before widening at the distal end.</p><p>The flagellomeres are largely the same shape, with the distal end of flagellomeres one to eight protruding sharply on the distal, ventral edge, giving the serrated appearance of the antennae. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Böhm Bristles</head><p>Böhm bristles are present on the condyle, scape, and pedicel, particularly in the junction between these antennal sections (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_61">34</ref> C &amp; D). The conical Böhm bristles taper to a point and are set into a concave depression in the surface of the antennae. They are variable in length (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_23">17</ref>)</p><p>and have no visible pores on the surface. Sensilla Chaetica (SC) Distal, Long and Stout Distal SC (Figure 35 B) were observed on the serrate protrusions of the antennae, set within a deep socket. There were between one and two present on flagellomeres 1 -8 and none observed on flagellomere 9. They are slightly striated, with blunt, pointed tips and aporous. Long sensilla chaetica (Figure 35 C) were rare and, if present, were found on the distal end of the scape and pedicel of both sexes. The surface of the long sensilla chaetica are aporous and striated with longitudinal grooves with the apex terminating in a sharp point. Of all the SC present, stout SC (Figure 35 A &amp; D) were the most numerous on both male and females. They were present in greatest numbers on the scape and pedicel and the ninth flagellomere in females. They are shorter than other SC and variable in length. In most cases they emerge from a narrow depression in the cuticle and lie flat along the surface of the antennae, their sharp tips pointing distally. The surface of the stout SC is aporous and deeply striated with three corrugated openings present at the base (Figure 35 D). The stout SC in females appear to be more deeply striated than the SC in males.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sensilla Basiconica</head><p>Stout &amp; Thin Sensilla Basiconica Stout sensilla basiconica (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_25">37</ref> A &amp; C) were present on all flagellomeres in both sexes however were more prevalent on females than males. They are shorter than thin sensilla basiconica with a broader base and a blunt tip. The stout SB sits within a shallow socket on flagellomeres 1 -8 and a much deeper socket on flagellomere 9. I found possible evidence of pores on the surface of the sensilla. I also found one bifurcated example of a short sensilla basiconica which is suspected to be a developmental issue.</p><p>Thin SB (A, B &amp; D) were rarer than stout sensilla basiconica but present on all flagellomeres in both sexes. They are longer and narrower than stout sensilla basiconica and have a sharper tip and variable in size. They were usually found amongst groups of stout sensilla basiconica, and more frequently on the distal flagellomeres particularly flagellomere 9.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Grooved Peg Sensilla</head><p>Grooved peg sensilla (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_39">38</ref>) are a sub-type of sensilla basiconica that were infrequently found on flagellomeres 1 -9 in both sexes but appeared to occur more in males. The sensilla are in broad, shallow, concave craters on the surface of the flagellomere. The wall and floor of the craters are wrinkled in texture. The base of the sensilla is broad, smooth, and circular in circumference, gradually tapering before narrowing distally to form deep, vertical grooves resembling digits.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Chemosensory Hairs</head><p>Terminal Pore Hair &amp; Wall Pore Hair I found one candidate for a terminal pore hair (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_27">39</ref> C &amp; D) typically found on the edges of flagellomeres. They emerge from depressions in the cuticle and run parallel to the cuticle. The sensilla is robust in appearance with a broad base rising to a blunt tip. There appears to be a furrow at the tip of the sensilla which may imply a terminal pore.</p><p>I found one example of a possible wall pore hair sensilla (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_27">39</ref> A &amp; B) on the ninth flagellomere of a male. The sensilla is long, straight and hair like (but shorter than the surrounding sensilla filiformia) with smooth walls. The surface appears to have rows of pores suggesting an olfactory role. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sensilla Auricillica</head><p>Sensilla auricillica (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_28">40</ref>) were irregularly present on flagellomeres 1 -9 for both male and female antennae. They emerge from a broad socket with the antennal cuticle forming a collar around the base. The general appearance is similar to those found by <ref type="bibr" target="#b411">Zhang et al. (2015)</ref>, a conical sensilla that has been longitudinally compressed with a concave depression from the base to the apex giving the appearance of an ear with the apex terminating in a papilla. There was some variation in shape and torsion, with some having broader, rounder bases than others. The surface is densely covered in pores, suggesting a chemosensory function.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dome-shaped Organs and Sensilla Coeloconica</head><p>I did not find any evidence of dome-shaped organs or sensilla coeloconica present on the antennae of P. reticularis.  that these are likely still sensilla basiconica with two subtypes identified -thin and broad. The sensilla in the sensory pits were typically surrounded by two to three corrugated, semi-circular glandular openings that are seen in other prionines, although the function of these is unknown <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">(Dvořáček et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b156">Haddad et al., 2023)</ref>. It has been suggested that sensilla chaetica may be absent in the Prioninae <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">(Dvořáček et al., 2020)</ref> however I found examples of several sensilla chaetica subtypes on both male and female antennae.</p><p>Perhaps the most striking difference to other prionines is the dense pubescence of sensilla filiformia present on only the male antennae. This sexual dimorphism indicates that there is a role in reproductive behaviour, perhaps in mate searching or combat. Sensilla filiformia have been reported present in both sexes of the cerambycinine, Phoracantha recurva and are hypothesised to be mechanosensory receptors possibly related to wind detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">(Faucheux, 2011)</ref>. In this species, both sexes scramble to reach an ephemeral resource, stressed Eucalyptus spp., which may indicate that whatever the cue these sensilla receive is equally important to both sexes.</p><p>Electrophysiological data in Orthoptera supports a mechanoreceptive role for Sensilla filiformia, with detection of slight vibrations being of importance for predator avoidance <ref type="bibr" target="#b141">(Gnatzy &amp; Tautz, 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b346">Steinmann &amp; Casas, 2017)</ref>. I can only speculate as to why sensilla filiformia are present in males. Whilst both males and females of P. reticularis are mobile, males likely spend more of their time in flight searching for females and could be perceived to need to process information relating to air movement (such as orientating to face the prevalent air current) or have an increased risk of encountering predators (such as Ninox novaeseelandiae, <ref type="bibr">Edwards, 1961c)</ref>. Other possible roles for mechanoreception in P. reticularis is in male-male combat and mate guarding.</p><p>These sensilla may provide information relevant to fights, such as opponent size. Males engaged in mate guarding post-copulation outstretched their antennae and attempted to orientate themselves towards individuals that make contact with the antennae (pers. obs.). These sensilla would be excellent candidates for electroantennography and transmission electron microscopy work in the future combined with behavioural experiments.</p><p>Sensilla are fundamental to how insects perceive their surroundings and understanding the sensilla present on antennae can allow us to make inferences into the life history of a species and its sensory ecology. Sexual dimorphism in the types, distribution, and morphology of antennal sensilla suggest that sexual selection is acting on the antennae, and in the case of P. reticularis, provides evidence for the importance of chemical cues for males in mate-searching. I also suggest that future research should explore the role of sensilla filiformia in males which may provide further insight into the mating system of P. reticularis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Chapter 7 General Discussion</head><p>The study of insects as food is a multidisciplinary field, requiring research and researchers that can bring together different areas of knowledge to tackle the challenges that are found in this area. The aims of this thesis were twofold, to explore the social licence and cultural history of insects as food in Aotearoa New Zealand (Chapters 2 &amp; 3), and to explore the biology of a wellknown edible insect, the huhu beetle Prionoplus reticularis <ref type="bibr">(Chapters 4,</ref><ref type="bibr">5 &amp; 6)</ref>.</p><p>The success of an industry is contingent on its acceptability to the society in which it operates, and, in this thesis, I found Aotearoa to have a rich history of past insect use (Chapter 2) and a social licence for the nascent industry developing around edible insects. Survey participants' responses were nuanced showing that people were generally very open to eating insects and had a reasonable degree of knowledge and experience of edible insects in Aotearoa. However, this contrasted with insect ingredients being described more negatively than other more "conventional" ingredients (Chapter 3).</p><p>In Chapter 2, I collated a comprehensive catalogue of insects that have been used as food in traditional and more recent settings, which found considerably more edible insect species in Aotearoa than has previously been reported in the literature. Whilst there are several well-known native edible insect species documented, it was the off-hand references in the grey literature to lesser-known native insects used by Māori that hints at the knowledge that may have been lost or hidden following European settlement. Future efforts should be made to ensure mātauranga is not lost and this would benefit from kaupapa Māori led research. Recent work by O'Connor et al. ( <ref type="formula">2023</ref>) is an excellent starting point for this, and demonstrated that there is (1) mātauranga regarding insect species and their uses that is not recorded in the literature and, (2) interest in greater access to traditional food types and the customs surrounding them. WAI262 will play an important role in shaping the edible insect sector and provides the opportunity to look at different ways of making insects accessible, for instance through the lens of food sovereignty.</p><p>We may benefit from the learnings of other countries' efforts to preserve traditional knowledge of edible insects. In Japan, a successful initiative connected older generations with school children to pass on their knowledge of insect use <ref type="bibr" target="#b263">(Nonaka &amp; Yanagihara, 2020)</ref>. Chapter 2 also included a surprisingly large number of non-native insects used in contemporary ways, indicative of the diverse cultural make-up of Aotearoa and its connections to the rest of the world. One particularly fascinating and somewhat surreal highlight was discovering the export of wasp nests from Aotearoa to Japan in the 1990's. This no longer appears to occur, although at a recent conference I was approached by researchers from a Japanese university who indicated there is still a demand for this export. This raises the prospect of harvesting invasive species, which are plentiful in Aotearoa, for export overseas. This would dovetail nicely into government initiatives such as Predator Free 2050, although whether it is wise to encourage a sunset industry is debatable and may lead to an unwanted outcome to protect wasps to ensure livelihoods remain intact.</p><p>Chapter 2 also addresses a complicated legislative framework which makes it difficult for startups to produce food-grade products. I found a concerning trend indicating insect businesses struggle to be viable in Aotearoa. Over a ten-year period, out of the eight companies I found trading, only two appear to still be active, suggesting challenges to achieving commercial success in this market. Currently, the easiest route to market would be through wild harvesting of insects which carries risks of exploitation if not managed carefully. The viability of the industry is likely to be related to a variety of reasons, but one obvious area for improvement are regulations governing the production of insects for human consumption. Streamlining legislation, whilst maintaining food safety standards, would allow greater innovation in this space whilst providing consumer confidence in the safety of products. Whilst not explored in this thesis, by comparison Australia has a greater number of insects as food and feed companies and an industry body lobbying for the support of the industry. It would be prudent to learn from the successes of our neighbour, with which we already share some common legislature, as we develop our own industry. In the interim, start-ups could diversify their cashflow by producing insects for pet &amp; livestock whilst they build capacity to sell to humans, allowing them access to a less regulated market reducing compliance costs whilst also honing mass production techniques necessary to make a product competitive.</p><p>Chapter 2 also found that companies selling edible insect products have relied heavily on sustainability and nutritional claims in their marketing, however there is little validation of these claims such as a life cycle analysis of their product, instead relying on research produced in other countries. It is well established <ref type="bibr" target="#b158">(Halloran et al., 2016)</ref> that the sustainability of insects is very context dependent on the specific production techniques and species used and caution should be used when presenting generalised statements on the environmental benefits of insects. This is an area where researchers can play a role in supporting businesses, by investigating sustainability claims made in the context of Aotearoa. This will help increase consumer trust in the sector and potentially provide a competitive edge to products from this country compared to products imported from overseas.</p><p>The sustainability claims we saw in Chapter 2 appear to have permeated into the public discourse for insects as food. In Chapter 3, I found that words associated with cricket flour clearly matched the marketing techniques employed by companies e.g., as being environmentally friendly ("green", "environmental", and "alternative") and nutritious ("high protein", "gluten free"). Cricket flour was the insect-based ingredient with the highest positive sentiment score, ranking higher than conventional meat products. This presents tangential evidence that marketing of cricket flour has been quite successful and is a strategy that could be replicated with other insect products, such as "sky prawns". Huhu grubs and grasshoppers had a neutral sentiment rating similar to lamb, shrimp, beef and tofu and words associated with them related to their perceived flavours and textures, or to cultural references associated with these items. As the overall sentiment is neutral and they are largely associated with food, these species may have a low barrier to entry as a commercial food product.</p><p>There was a high degree of knowledge amongst participants, with 498 of 620 participants able to name one or more species of insect used as food, and 367 participants having eaten an insect in the past. I also found several attributes that predict the likelihood of eating insects in the future, with likelihood increasing with prior experience, existing knowledge, and a low food neophobia score. This suggests strategies to increase the acceptance of insects as food should focus on education, tasting experiences and incorporating into familiar dishes and by reducing the "insectness" of the product (e.g., a powder or flour).</p><p>In Chapter 2 I suggested that the easiest native insects to rear in NZ, these are Locusta migratoria and Teleogryllus commodus both of which are being farmed. P. reticularis could be another candidate albeit a challenging one due to it long lifecycle, but there have been strides in reducing to under one year in laboratory conditions, this, combined with the well-known status as a food in NZ society (Chapter 3), would make it the next most promising candidate.</p><p>A key finding in Chapter 3 was the tension between people's stated openness to eating insects and the predominantly negative sentiment of words used to describe most insect products. This may indicate an unconscious bias against some insect ingredients and could be indicative of a value-action gap amongst participants, i.e., expressing a willingness to eat insects, whilst this doesn't translate into the action of eating insects. This may also explain the limited success of businesses discovered in Chapter 2 and is an area that warrants further research attention.</p><p>In Chapter 2, I found several references to the flavour of P. reticularis varying based on the timber they are found in. This suggested that (1) biotic and abiotic factors influence the metabolic compounds within larvae, analogous to the influence of terroir on the metabolomic profile of wine and, <ref type="bibr" target="#b148">(2)</ref> this quality might allow us to assess the provenance of an edible insect, i.e., fingerprint it to a particular location. Using GC-MS, I found that the metabolomic profile of P.</p><p>reticularis varied between locations and that a random forest classification model trained on this data was reasonably successful at determining the location of collection for a huhu grub. It would be worthwhile, however, to compare different models (e.g., SVM, SIMCA) to attempt to improve classification accuracy.</p><p>The ability to distinguish the provenance of an edible insect product provides several potential benefits. With the increase of trade agreements containing regional protections, it allows the detection of food fraud (e.g., a product being labelled as from a high value location but is actually from somewhere with a lower value). It also allows legislators or stakeholders to place restrictions, and detect infringement of those restrictions, on the sale of insects from certain locations, for instance due to concerns over sustainability.</p><p>However, it must be noted that I only explored spatial variation, and to validate this method I would need to further explore the effects of temporal variation and dietary variation on metabolites. There is already indirect evidence of diet influencing the metabolite profile of P.</p><p>reticularis (Chapter 2) and future research could compare the effects of different timber on the profile of the larvae. Given the mātauranga associated with the impact of timber on flavour, future research would benefit from collaboration with Māori to elucidate the physiological processes behind this. This research may also benefit insect farmers, given that the flavour of farmed insects is held to be inferior to wild-harvested insects <ref type="bibr">(Evans et al., 2017, p. 179)</ref>, a phenomenon likely driven by differences in diet.</p><p>The time of year will influence the metabolite profile as physiological processes such as cold tolerance and diapause entail changes to metabolism. I saw differences in two sugar compounds, mannose and trehalose, which are known to be important for freeze tolerance. They were the most abundant sugars identified in the larvae and varied along a latitudinal gradient, although in the opposite direction to what was expected. I have not been able to identify why this might be. I would expect these compounds to be more abundant in the cooler South and less abundant in the warmer North. It is likely that a controlled laboratory experiment would be required to tease apart what is happening here.</p><p>One element, I was unable to control for was the gut microbiome which is likely to interact with the metabolome and would be a fruitful area to investigate in the future. The gut microbiome is known to vary across the geographical locations of Costelytra zealandica and this is likely the case in P. reticularis (H. <ref type="bibr" target="#b410">Zhang &amp; Jackson, 2008)</ref>. The gut microbiome of P. reticularis has been investigated in the past, but just from one location <ref type="bibr" target="#b304">(Reid et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b384">Viswam et al., 2019)</ref>. I found the five-carbon sugar, arabinose, to be weakly correlated with latitude, and in insects this sugar is utilised by gut bacteria which raises the possibility that the metabolomic profile is partially influenced by gut contents.</p><p>In Chapter 4, I also found proline and alanine to be the most abundant amino acids present, and these compounds are known to be important metabolites for powering flight in adult beetles. In Chapter 5, I investigated traits associated with flight and found that heavier males flew faster for longer. It would be interesting to investigate if proline and alanine abundance correlates disproportionately with increasing larval mass. Larger larvae, which in turn become larger adults, may have comparatively more of these amino acids than their smaller conspecifics providing better flight performance as an adult. If this is the case, then investigating the abiotic and biotic factors that govern larval size, could also assist in manipulating desired nutritional quality and weight. From previous work I have done on Hermetia illucens (Diptera: Stratiomyidae), black soldier fly, larval density and diet can greatly influence larval size <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Birrell, 2018)</ref> and this is likely to also be the case in P. reticularis.</p><p>The majority of research on P. reticularis has been through the lens of its role as a forestry pest (Chapter 2). Other than the seminal work of Edwards (1956, 1959, 1961b, 1961c, 1961d, 1961a,   1965), little is known of many aspects of the life history of this species. However, understanding the behaviour of an insect species is crucial to successful rearing in a captive system. I sought to address this knowledge gap by investigating the mating system of P. reticularis (Chapter 5).</p><p>Chapter 5 highlighted how allometric patterns are a powerful tool for understanding the interplay of different selective pressures on an animal. The mating system of P. reticularis is characterised by scramble competition where males attempt to find and mate with as many females as possible. This puts selective pressure on male traits that improve their ability to acquire mates.</p><p>Locomotion and olfaction are critical for acquiring mates and this likely drives the sexual dimorphism I found, with males having longer antennae than females, and females being larger in all other respects. I hypothesised there would be positive allometry in male traits (e.g., antennae and wing size) with larger males investing disproportionately in these traits. This was not the case however, with most male traits exhibiting negative allometry. I attributed this to stabilising selection, with biomechanical constraints likely restricting excessive investment in traits.</p><p>In Chapter 5, I also designed and built six flight mills using a 3-D printer and low cost, everyday laboratory consumables and electronic components. This presents a novel way to collect data on flying species on a budget, or with limited access to laboratory space. I also developed a novel way of attaching beetles to the flight mill. Typically, low temperature hot glue is used, however this still appeared to cause discomfort to the beetle, potentially impacting their behaviour, and requires you to do this multiple times if the beetle needs to be reattached. To avoid this, I used a quick drying super glue to attach half of a staple to the pronotum of the beetle. This allows for the easy attachment of the beetle to a neodymium magnet which can then be removed and reattached as required.</p><p>In Chapter six, I further investigated the sexual dimorphism in antennae size observed in Chapter 5. Using scanning electron microscopy, I observed several sensilla that are only present on male antennae which have roles in chemoreception and mechanoreception in other taxa. This again emphasises the importance of detecting females using sensory cues for males of this species. The sexual dimorphism was particularly striking in the dense sensilla filiformia present only on the male antennae. These have not been reported on any other prionine beetle <ref type="bibr" target="#b156">(Haddad et al., 2023)</ref> and in other insect orders have been attributed to mechanoreception <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">(Faucheux, 2011)</ref>. In hawk moths, the speed of flight and pectinate antennal morphology are optimised to slow the passage of air and ensure the capture of odour molecules <ref type="bibr" target="#b183">(Jaffar-Bandjee et al., 2020)</ref>. I hypothesis that the dense sensilla filiformia on the male antennae of P. reticularis perform a similar role, acting as a mechanoreceptor to provide dynamic information on flight whilst also slowing air flow over the antennal surface to ensure pheromone molecules are captured by chemosensory sensilla.</p><p>I attempted a variety of different experiments to quantify mating success, strength of olfactory responses and captive breeding in this species, however these were unsuccessful due to a variety of reasons such as the beetles not exhibiting normal behaviour in a confined environment, the relatively short breeding window in which adults are active, and a pandemic and lockdowns corresponding with field seasons. Whilst disappointing at the time, these challenges did drive innovation (particularly in the construction of the flight mills) and highlighted some of the challenges of trying to rear P. reticularis in a closed system for the production of insect protein.</p><p>With the benefit of more field seasons, I suspect it would be possible to overcome these issues and eventually devise a rearing protocol. However, if commercialisation was the goal, a simpler solution might be to pursue semi-domestication similar to the production of palm weevils in the tropics. In this scenario, a solution might be to prepare an attractive ovipositioning medium, perhaps with kairomones attractive to female P. reticularis, such as α-&amp; β-pinene lures developed for monitoring forestry pests <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Brockerhoff et al., 2006)</ref>. Following this, it might be possible to allow females in the wild to inoculate this media. If so, this would be a straightforward way to proceed and could be done in tandem with further research into captive breeding.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Concluding remarks</head><p>In summary, there are challenges faced by the edible insect sector but, with proper support from academia and government, there is great potential for growing the industry further in Aotearoa.</p><p>Culturally, there is an acceptance and existing awareness that insects can be food and this may reduce the barrier to uptake that is seen in other Western nations. The rich cultural history, and diverse array of edible insect species available, offers an opportunity to showcase edible insect species whilst preserving and celebrating traditional food practices. A sustainable source of domestically produced protein could provide increased food security and sovereignty to communities in Aotearoa, whilst diversifying our agricultural sector. Reaching high densities in our pine plantations, the huhu grub is perfectly placed to champion this movement. I hope this thesis can act as a foundation for future work to build upon whilst also adding to our understanding of a charismatic native insect, Prionoplus reticularis.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>........................................................................................................................................................................Table 2.

Of particular consideration for the commercialisation of any endemic insects in New Zealand is the WAI 262 report, Ko Aotearoa Tēnei<ref type="bibr" target="#b386">(Waitangi Tribunal, 2011)</ref>. WAI 262 was lodged by six iwi claimants to the Waitangi Tribunal, a standing commission of inquiry relating to alleged breaches of Te Tiriti o Waitangi by the Crown, in 1991. Often called the flora and fauna claim due to its particular focus on kaitiaki relationships with flora and fauna, it also encompasses kaitiaki relationships with the environment, protection, and transmission of mātauranga Māori, taonga works and, intellectual property (IP) relating to taonga species. As the first whole-of-government claim, its complexity is reflected in the extensive timeline with the hearings completed in 2007 and the report being issued in 2011, twenty years after the initial claim.</figDesc></figure>

I split the data set (n = 560) into training (n = 419) and test (n = 141) sets with the test set only used to assess the final model. Both the training and test sets were stratified by gender to minimise sampling bias arising from the imbalance between male and female. From the training data set, I used bootstrap resampling to create 25 new training and testing sets with which to evaluate the models. As the outcome variable was imbalanced (I had 3.25x as many likely to unlikely), I used the synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) (Chawla et al., 2002) to create synthetic data for the minority outcome class (unlikely) in the training dataset, allowing us to train the model efficiently without altering the testing dataset and reducing the risk of overfitting. I compared a logistic regression, random forest, and a Bayesian logistic regression model and selected the model using the confusion matrix, the area under the receiving operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC), specificity, and sensitivity. A confusion matrix contrasts false positives and negatives with true positives and negatives predicted by the models. Specificity measures how well the model correctly classifies actual positives a percentage, whilst sensitivity is a percentage of how well the model correctly classifies actual negatives. A ROC graph plots the true positive rate on the Y-axis and the false positive rate (1 -specificity) on the X-axis. I found the logistic regression model to perform best on the training data and used this as the final model.</figDesc></figure>

Due to this, I performed a non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test.To assess how wing dimensions affect flight performance in males, I used three generalised linear models (GLM) with a gamma distribution with a log-link function to predict (1) average flight duration in seconds, (2) average distance in millimetres, (3) average flight speed in metres per second, using body size (pronotum width in millimetres), wing aspect ratio and wing loading as predictors. For each model, I used the R package "Performance"<ref type="bibr" target="#b228">(Lüdecke et al., 2021)</ref> to visualise the data and confirm the assumptions of normality of residuals, normality of random effects, linear relationship, homogeneity of variance, and multicollinearity were met. All statistical analyses were conducted in R (R<ref type="bibr" target="#b298">Core Team, 2022;</ref> version 4.2.3).I fitted three general linear models (GLM), estimated using maximum likelihood, to predict the following measures of flight performance (1) average flight distance, (2) average flight duration and, (3) average flight speed with the independent variables body size (pronotum width), wing aspect ratio and wing loading (formula: 𝑓𝑓𝑙𝑙𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤ℎ𝑙𝑙 𝑝𝑝𝑙𝑙𝑎𝑎𝑓𝑓𝑏𝑏𝑎𝑎𝑚𝑚𝑎𝑎𝑤𝑤𝑝𝑝𝑙𝑙 𝑚𝑚𝑙𝑙𝑎𝑎𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑎𝑎𝑙𝑙 ~ 𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑦𝑦 𝑚𝑚𝑤𝑤𝑠𝑠𝑙𝑙 + 𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤 𝑎𝑎𝑚𝑚𝑝𝑝𝑙𝑙𝑝𝑝𝑙𝑙 𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑙𝑙𝑤𝑤𝑏𝑏 + 𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤 𝑙𝑙𝑏𝑏𝑎𝑎𝑏𝑏𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤). Standardized parameters were obtained by fitting the model on a standardized version of the dataset. 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs) and p-values were computed using a Wald t-distribution approximation.</figDesc></figure>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>There were 620 total responses to the questionnaire. Most respondents were Female (n = 422), European (n = 474), from Auckland (n = 267), in the 25 -34 age bracket (n = 222), with a postgraduate university education (n = 264), an individual income of between $50,001 -$70,000 (n = 121) and had an omnivorous diet (n= 473). In response to the question "have you eaten insects before?", 367 (59.2%) participants responded 'Yes'. The demographic breakdown of participants is presented in Table <ref type="table">4</ref>. The sample is not representative of the New Zealand population for the characteristics of gender, ethnicity, age and education and so generalisations for the whole of New Zealand should not be made when interpreting the results.</p><p>Specific Beliefs/Attitudes Towards Insects (Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>)</p><p>The participants' specific beliefs and attitudes relating to the consumption of insects is shown in Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> with disgust, risk, benefits, ethics and naturalness measured using nine items.</p><p>Participants were grouped by those who have eaten an insect before ("Yes" group) and those who have not eaten an insect before ("No" group). Disgust was measured with the statement "eating insects is disgusting". The yes group tended to disagree (66%) with this statement more than the no group (31%). Participants' perceptions of risks associated with eating insects was measured with three statements "eating insects will increase risk of infectious disease", "insects contain harmful toxins" and, "insects carry harmful microbes". Both groups showed similar patterns in response to these statements with a majority of participants selecting neither agree or disagree in response to the toxins and microbes statements. In the statement which specifically mentions the consumption of insects ("eating insects will increase risk of infectious disease"), the majority of participants disagreed with this statement (71% &amp; 63%). Statements investigating benefits of eating insects ("insects are highly nutritious" and "eating insects is good for the environment") received majority agreement from both groups (92% vs. 75%; 77% vs. 58%), however there was a greater degree of uncertainty found in the "No" group (7% vs. 20%; 20% vs. 31%). Ethics statements included "insects are capable of feeling pain" and "killing insects is immoral", the majority of both groups agreed that insects feel pain (52% vs. 56%) but disagreed that killing insects is immoral (67% vs. 55%). Finally, for the statement "it is not natural for humans to eat insects" the majority of participants in both groups disagreed (84% vs. 70%) although there was a difference between groups in those who agreed with the statement (5% vs. 15%).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Abstract</head><p>Molecular fingerprinting of food items can provide information on the species, geographic location and quality of an organism making it a useful tool for identifying food fraud, provenance and assessing quality. Metabolomics is frequently used for this purpose due to its ability to identify and quantify metabolites at a high resolution. This study investigates the efficacy of untargeted GC-MS metabolic profiling using two different derivatisation techniques, MCF and TMS, to fingerprint an edible insect species -the huhu grub (Prionoplus reticularis)along a latitudinal gradient. Huhu grubs, the larvae of Aotearoa New Zealand's largest longhorn beetle, are a culturally significant and commonly eaten insect throughout its range. I found that the accuracy of a random forest model trained on the TMS-derived metabolite profile was superior compared to MCF. I found several compounds, including arabinose and urea, that had a weak, linear correlation with latitude. Compounds with high relative abundance in this species were mannose and trehalose, which are known to be important for freeze tolerance in other species, and exhibited a surprising trend along the latitudinal gradient which warrants further research. Proline and alanine were the most abundant amino acids present, and these compounds are known to be important metabolites for flight in adult beetles. I suggest that future research should investigate the metabolomic signatures of temporal and dietary variations in this species, which would further validate the use of metabolomic fingerprinting in this species. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Allometry</head><p>Full allometric statistical outputs are provided in Table <ref type="table">2</ref> and <ref type="table">Figure 4</ref>. In summary, the wing length and area and tibia length of P. reticularis exhibited negative allometry for males and isometry for females. Antennal length of P. reticularis exhibited negative allometry for both males and females. Ninth flagellomere length exhibited isometry in both males and females. Wing aspect ratio exhibited very low correlation with pronotum width (wing aspect ratio male, r2 = 0.063, female, r2 = 0.071). Wing loading exhibited isometry for males and negative allometry for females. Note: F9 = ninth flagellomere. Wing area has been reduced to one dimension by square root prior to log transformation.</p></div>

I investigated antennal ultrastructure morphology and sexual dimorphism in this species using scanning electron microscopy. I identified several sensilla that were only present in males: sensilla filiformia, sensilla auricillica, wall pore hairs and distal sensilla chaetica. These sensilla are known to have chemosensory and mechanosensory functions in other insect groups, suggesting these senses play an important role in male mating strategies.</p><p>Above this protrusion is a small, sharp spur, mirrored on both the lateral and medial faces. The ventral surface of the antennae is densely pitted, with each pit containing several sensilla. The dorsal, medial surface has fewer pits, usually containing a sensillum. The terminus of the ninth flagellomere is rounded and laterally compressed with well-defined pits. The male flagellomeres are densely covered in sensilla filiformia with flagellomeres 6 -9 at least as long if not longer than flagellomeres 1 -5. The female flagellomeres do not have the sensilla filiformia found in the males, however they are densely pitted and flagellomeres 6 -9 are reduced, being smaller than flagellomeres 1 -5. Average (arithmetic mean) measurements for individual sensilla length are presented in Table <ref type="table">17</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sensilla filiformia</head><p>The flagellomeres on the male antennae are densely covered in long, aporous, ciliated sensilla filiformia that are not present on the female antennae (Figure <ref type="figure">36 A</ref>). I was only able to distinguish one type of sensilla filiformia present, characterised by their wavy, ciliated and flexible appearance, frequently entwining around one another (Figure <ref type="figure">36 D</ref>). These structures give a slight pubescent appearance to the male antennae that is visible to the naked eye. Longitudinal striations run from the base of these sensilla up to around one third of the length of the structure. Several sensilla filiformia were broken at the base or apex which revealed a hollow structure through its length (Figure <ref type="figure">36 C</ref>). The sensilla are situated in shallow insertions and surrounded by two to three corrugated openings (Figure <ref type="figure">36 B</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sensilla on the Ninth Flagellomere</head><p>On the ninth flagellomere of males, I found several different sensilla types that emerge from inside deep pits surrounded by cuticular collars (Figure <ref type="figure">41</ref>). Two of the sensilla appear to be similar to sensilla basiconica but inset into the cuticle. I tentatively label these as sensilla basiconica broad (Figure <ref type="figure">41 B</ref>) and thin (Figure <ref type="figure">41</ref> C &amp; D) however further examination using transmission electron microscopy is required.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>I described the sensilla ultrastructures present on the antennae of male and female P. reticularis providing the first ultrastructure investigation of an endemic prionine and first investigation of a prionine in the Meroscelisini tribe. The most abundant antennal sensilla present on the antennae of both sexes, sensilla basiconica, are associated with chemoreception further supporting the importance olfaction plays in this species perception of its environment <ref type="bibr">(Edwards 1961;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b277">Pawson et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>I found evidence of sexual dimorphism in the antennal sensilla, with several sensilla types only found on the male antennae. The most abundant ultrastructure, present only in males, were sensilla filiformia suggesting that these sensilla are important in male behaviour. Also present only in males, but in low numbers, were sensilla auricillica, wall pore hairs and distal sensilla chaetica. Grooved peg sensilla were common on male antennae but rarely seem on females.</p><p>Sensilla auricillica showed a multiporous surface and are proposed to be involved in the reception of female produced sex pheromones. The sensilla chaetica of the female antennae featured much deeper, more pronounced striae than male sensilla chaetica. Whilst the functional significance is unknown, the sensilla chaetica may be related to the female assessing physical characteristics of suitable oviposition sites, as I have observed female P. reticularis using their antennae (and ovipositors) to interact with substrates prior to laying eggs.</p><p>There are only two studies investigating the antennal ultrastructures of the Prioninae, both</p><p>showing highly unusual antennal ultrastructures when compared to other cerambycid subfamilies. The antennae of both sexes of P. reticularis were covered in the sensory pits reported in the other two prionines studied <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">(Dvořáček et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b156">Haddad et al., 2023)</ref> and contained a sensillum similar in structure to the sensilla described variously as coeloconica <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">(Dvořáček et al., 2020)</ref> and unidentified prionine sensilla <ref type="bibr" target="#b156">(Haddad et al., 2023)</ref>.
