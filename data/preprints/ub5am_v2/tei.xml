<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>The accuracy of psychological assessment is critical to effective clinical practice and reliable psychological research. However, traditional self-report measures have significant limitations, including well-documented response biases such as social desirability, acquiescence, extreme responding, and central tendency biases <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Paulhus, 1984)</ref>, as well as issues with fixed response formats and interpretation variability <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Schuman &amp; Presser, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Schwarz, 1999)</ref>.</p><p>These limitations are particularly relevant when assessing complex psychological constructs like Future Self-Continuity (FSC). FSC, the perceived connection between one's present and future self, consists of three interrelated components: similarity (the belief that one's future self will resemble their current self), vividness (the clarity and detail with which one can imagine their future self), and positive affect (a positive assessment of one's future self) <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Han et al., 2025;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Sokol &amp; Serper, 2020)</ref>. High levels of FSC are associated with increased motivation, goal-directed behavior, better long-term planning and decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bartels &amp; Urminsky, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Ersner-Hershfield et al., 2009)</ref>, improved self-regulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Blouin-Hudon &amp; Pychyl, 2015)</ref>, and greater life satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Reiff et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>The multifaceted nature of FSC, particularly the subjective assessment of components like vividness (where individuals may have vastly different internal experiences and interpretations of the concept), makes it especially vulnerable to the limitations inherent in traditional self-report measures. To overcome these assessment challenges, innovative approaches are needed.</p><p>Natural Language Processing (NLP), a branch of artificial intelligence focused on understanding and generating human language, offers a potential alternative to traditional self-report assessment <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Boyd et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Tausczik &amp; Pennebaker, 2010)</ref>. Large Language Models (LLMs), a type of advanced deep learning model, trained on massive amounts of text data, can understand context, process natural language fluently, and identify subtle patterns in text <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Alizadeh et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Fischer &amp; Dörpinghaus, 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr">Fischer et al., 2024)</ref>. Earlier NLP methods like LIWC <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Boyd et al., 2022)</ref> were limited to analyzing pre-defined linguistic features such as pronoun use and emotional tone words. In contrast, LLMs' deep learning architectures can analyze complex patterns of meaning across entire transcripts, enabling a more holistic assessment of psychological constructs.</p><p>Using LLMs and NLP may offer significant advantages over traditional written responses.</p><p>Speaking is often more natural and comfortable than writing, as writing is often a more formal and less frequent activity that typically occurs in more artificial environments <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Anwar &amp; Ahmed, 2016)</ref>. Thus, verbal responses can be more spontaneous, less filtered, and a more authentic reflection of thoughts and feelings. This is particularly relevant when discussing personal, sensitive topics. Additionally, verbal responses may be less susceptible to response biases.</p><p>Therefore, the current study aims to validate a novel NLP-based method of assessment derived from the analysis of verbal responses to open-ended prompts. This is the first application of LLMs to assess a psychological construct like FSC through the analysis of verbal responses elicited from a theoretically grounded structured interview. We hypothesize that the NLP-derived FSC scores will be significantly correlated with scores from a traditional, well-established FSC measure, the Future Self-Continuity Questionnaire (FSCQ; <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Han et al., 2025;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Sokol &amp; Serper, 2020)</ref>, providing support for the convergent validity of this new NLP-based assessment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>Participants (N = 164) were recruited via CloudResearch, utilizing their "whitelisted" Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) worker pool. Their ages ranged from 20 to 73 years (M = 38.85, SD = 11.20), with 54.9% identifying as male and 43.9% as female, and 56.7 having a Bachelor's degree or higher. The majority of the sample was White (67.7%) and included individuals with varying levels of psychological distress. Further demographic details, including socioeconomic status and detailed ethnic breakdown, are available in the protocol paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Sokol et al., 2025)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures</head><p>Future Self-Continuity Questionnaire (FSCQ). The FSCQ is a 10-item scale assessing the perceived connection between one's present and future self <ref type="bibr">(Sokol &amp; Serper, 2019)</ref>. It measures three components-Similarity, Vividness, and Positive Affect-using a 6-point Likert scale. Participants provided informed consent before completing the FSCQ online. They then recorded verbal responses to the 15 prompts using Vocaroo (www.vocaroo.com), a web-based audio recording service. Participants were compensated $3.34, with a potential $2.00 bonus for high-quality audio recordings of sufficient length. The average recording duration was 15 minutes and 42 seconds (SD = 9 minutes 15 seconds), ranging from 2 minute 13 seconds to 1 hour 3 minutes 6 seconds.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Analysis</head><p>Audio recordings were checked for overtly identifying information (e.g., names, addresses). As none was found, no further redaction was necessary. They were then transcribed using Microsoft Word automatic transcription, after which each transcript was checked against the recording. The corrected transcripts were then analyzed using the Claude 3.5 Sonnet API <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Anthropic, 2024a)</ref>, selected for its demonstrated intelligence, exceeding prior models in benchmarks relevant to nuanced natural language understanding and reasoning <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Anthropic, 2024a)</ref>, and for its strong adherence to safety protocols <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Anthropic, 2024a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Anthropic, , 2024b))</ref>. A specific prompt was engineered to assess overall FSC and its subcomponents (Similarity, Vividness, and Positive Affect) on a 1-6 scale using detailed rubrics for each dimension that were developed based on FSC theory and research (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Sokol &amp; Serper, 2020)</ref>. The prompt was engineered to provide specific instructions and a standardized output format, while the rubrics were designed with detailed descriptors for each score level to enhance scoring reliability. See Appendix for the full prompt and rubrics.</p><p>Analyses were conducted using Python 3.8 with the Anthropic package (version 0.3.4) and R 4.4.1.. The prompt template was standardized (see Appendix). Default API temperature (1.0) and Top-p settings were used. Maximum token length was set to 2000. Transcripts were processed in batches using the Anthropic API's batch processing feature. The system prompt containing scoring instructions was provided first, followed by each transcript as a user message. The API returned structured assessments following a standardized format that included analyses and numerical scores for overall FSC and each subcomponent.</p><p>The model initially used was claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620 (API cost: $0.011 per transcript; $1.77 total). To further validate the NLP-based assessment, the analysis was replicated using an updated version of the same model, claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022 (API cost: $0.009 per transcript; $1.54 total). The two versions of the NLP-FSCQ were highly correlated (see Results).</p><p>All subsequent analyses utilize scores derived from the updated model.</p><p>The NLP analysis generated an overall NLP-FSCQ score and individual subscale scores.</p><p>Convergent validity was assessed via Pearson correlations between the traditional FSCQ and NLP-FSCQ total scores. Correlations between corresponding subscales were also examined. A Bland-Altman plot assessed agreement between the two measures across the score range.</p><p>Moderated regression analyses tested whether response length moderated the relationship between FSCQ and NLP-FSCQ scores.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> presents descriptive statistics and correlations for all primary variables. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> presents correlations between NLP-FSCQ scores derived from the initial June 2024 Claude 3.5 Sonnet model and the updated October 2024 version. These correlations are very high, ranging from r = .54 to r = .92 (all ps &lt; .001). The total FSC scores from the two versions, in particular, are almost perfectly correlated (r = .91, p &lt; .001). These very high correlations provide strong evidence for the robustness of the NLP-based assessment across different model iterations. Subsequent analyses utilize scores derived from the updated claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022 model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>NLP DERIVED ASSESSMENT OF FUTURE SELF CONTINUITY</head><p>The traditional FSCQ total score and the NLP-FSCQ total score were moderately correlated, r(162) = .57, p &lt; .001, 95% CI <ref type="bibr">[.45, .66]</ref>. Correlations between corresponding FSCQ and NLP-FSCQ subscales were: Similarity, r(162) = .49, p &lt; .001, 95% CI <ref type="bibr">[.36, .60</ref>]; Vividness, r(162) = .35, p &lt; .001, 95% CI <ref type="bibr">[.21, .48</ref>]; and Positive Affect, r(162) = .62, p &lt; .001, 95% CI <ref type="bibr">[.52, .71</ref>]. Moderated regression analyses showed response length did not significantly moderate convergent validity for the total FSC score (interaction p = .959, ΔR² = .000) or its subscales (all interaction ps &gt; .05, all ΔR² &lt; .013). In addition, the Bland-Altman analysis (mean difference: -0.73; 95% limits of agreement: -2.85, 1.39) revealed no significant proportional bias (r = -.053, p = .497) and normally distributed differences (Shapiro-Wilk W = 0.987, p = .136), indicating acceptable agreement between measures (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>The study's aim was to demonstrate and validate a novel NLP-based assessment of future self-continuity (FSC) derived from verbal responses against a traditional measure of FSC. Our findings of a significant moderate positive correlation between traditionally measured FSC and the NLP-measured FSC support the new assessment method's validity. The Bland-Altman analysis supported convergent validity based on consistent agreement across the measurement range with no systematic bias. The replication of the NLP method using an updated version of the LLM model (Claude Sonnet 3.5 version 10.22) also supports the new assessment method's robustness. Finally, the lack of significant moderation by response length across total scores and subscales demonstrates that response length does not affect the NLP-FSC's convergent validity and supports its validity and use without requiring standardizing response duration.</p><p>Although the moderate correlation between these measures of FSC provides evidence of convergent validity, the medium effect size suggests that while the NLP measure is tapping into the same construct, the richness and spontaneity of verbal responses, and LLM's ability to respond to subtle patterns in language may enable this method to capture unique aspects of FSC not fully captured by traditional self-report measures. This can be seen in the varying strengths of the relationships, with positive affect being the highest, which people explicitly recognize about themselves, and a self-report may have an easier time assessing, while vividness was lower. It may be that the vividness of one's future self is inherently different when speaking it out loud versus rating it on a scale. People may not easily be able to accurately assess if their future is vivid without a clear internal comparison group, but when they describe their future, its vividness is apparent in the clarity and detail. Therefore, the LLM picks up on those nuances of language that the FSCQ might miss. If this is correct, the lower correlation may paradoxically reinforce the importance of the novel assessment method. This is the first application of LLMs in the psychological assessment of future self-continuity using verbal responses elicited from a theoretically based structured interview. This approach may have potential for use in multiple domains of psychological assessment, including other forms of identity, such as self-esteem, but also mood, personality, and mental health. It has significant potential advantages over traditional self-report measures due to the spontaneity, reduced susceptibility to Likert item response biases, greater ecological validity in its use of natural language, and potential to capture the nuances of the underlying psychological constructs.</p><p>However, there are significant limitations to this study. The use of an online MTurk sample that was also predominantly White, USA-based, and English-speaking limits generalizability. The findings would be strengthened with cross-validations in diverse populations. In addition, while recording verbal responses may reduce certain response biases like central tendency, they may introduce others, such as performance anxiety or social desirability. Finally, current technology and understanding of NLP and LLMs are limited, with LLMs acting as "black boxes" where it is challenging to know precisely what the model is picking up on in its assessment of the construct. Furthermore, while the method was robust against the update in the model, future models may yield varying results.</p><p>Future research should seek to refine the NLP method, including experimenting with different prompts and LLMs, and exploring the integration of other modalities, such as video, in addition to audio. This should be combined with investigating how ongoing advancements in LLM technology, particularly in the areas of nuanced language understanding and bias mitigation, might further enhance the accuracy and reliability of this assessment method. In addition, future studies should attempt to apply this NLP-based assessment method to other psychological constructs, such as personality traits, mood, and mental health. It can also be applied to the prediction of future states and mental health outcomes. Preliminary evidence from our ongoing longitudinal study (N=164 at Time 1, N=100 at Time 2 [15-month follow-up]) suggests NLP-derived FSC scores predict future suicidal ideation severity, planning, and hospitalization.</p><p>In conclusion, this study demonstrates the convergent validity and robustness of a novel NLP-based assessment of Future Self-Continuity. By capturing subtle patterns in verbal expression overlooked by traditional self-reports, this method has the potential to significantly enhance research and clinical practice. For example, low NLP-derived FSC vividness could signal the need for interventions like guided imagery or narrative therapy to improve their motivation and long-term well-being. More broadly, this work supports using NLP and LLMs to enhance psychological assessment and, thereby, to better understand and support mental health.  3: Moderate sense of FSC.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Appendix: LLM Prompt and Scoring Rubrics for Future Self-Continuity Assessment &lt;background&gt; Future self-continuity (FSC) refers to the psychological connectedness people have with their future selves-the sense of persistence of selfhood from the present to the future. It represents the degree to which a person identifies their future self as being the same person as their current self.</p><p>FSC has three subcomponents:</p><p>1. Similarity to the future self: How similar one's current self is to their future self in terms of beliefs, values, personality, and other aspects of identity.</p><p>2. Vividness of the future self: How vividly an individual can imagine their future self and project themselves into the future. 2. Assign a score between 1 and 6 for the overall FSC and each subcomponent (Similarity, Vividness, and Positivity). Scores can include up to 3 decimal places (e.g., 3.425) for precision.</p></div>			</div>
