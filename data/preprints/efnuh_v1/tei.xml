<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Prior research indicates that social functioning is impacted by both social engagement and affective experience regarding social interactions. The goal of this study was to examine the extent to which each component, as well as their interaction, contributes to social dysfunction in a combined nonclinical and transdiagnostic psychiatric sample. A sample of young adults (n=144) spanning the social dysfunction spectrum completed measures that capture different forms of psychopathology relevant to social dysfunction, from which two dimensions -namely Social Negative Affect (SNA) and Social Disengagement (SD) -were extracted using Principal Components Analysis. Participants additionally completed a variety of clinician-rated and self-reported social functioning measures that were aggregated into one overall social functioning score. Hierarchical regression was used to examine the unique contribution of SNA and SD and their interaction on overall social functioning. SNA and SD explained unique variance (Δr 2 =46.3%), indicating that elevated SNA and SD levels predicted worse social functioning. The SNA-by-SD interaction was positive and explained significant additional amounts of variance (Δr 2 =2.9%), indicating a less-than-additive effect on social dysfunction. These effects remained significant after controlling for intellectual functioning. The findings suggest that examining social behaviors and affect simultaneously is important for understanding social functional outcomes in clinical populations.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1.">Social Dysfunction in Clinical Populations</head><p>Social dysfunction is a major source of impairment and diminished quality of life in several mental illnesses, including schizophrenia-spectrum disorders, autism, and social anxiety <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Blanchard et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bottema-Beutel et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Davila &amp; Beck, 2002)</ref>. Social dysfunction is characterized by diminished engagement in satisfying interpersonal relationships and activities and with elevated challenges navigating interpersonal conflicts. It is, therefore, a key transdiagnostic feature of psychopathology and an important intervention target. Yet, current treatments fail to substantially improve social dysfunction in psychiatric populations, calling for a deeper understanding of the mechanisms leading to social dysfunction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2.">Behavioral and Affective Indicators of Social Dysfunction</head><p>Numerous factors contribute to social dysfunction, obscuring clear treatment targets. The literature emphasizes how altered social engagement contributes to social dysfunction. Consequently, social dysfunction is often quantified based on the frequency and quality of social interactions. For example, the schizophrenia literature emphasizes objective reductions in social contacts/activities as key features of social disability <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Green et al., 2018)</ref>. In addition, social functioning measures emphasize level of engagement with friends, family, and new social contacts (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Cornblatt et al., 2007)</ref>. Measuring direct behavioral engagement in social interactions is thus integral to understanding social functioning, particularly given its role in the size and quality of one's social world. However, it is well known that affective experiences regarding social interactions -which appear to be partly (albeit less explicitly) reflected in social functioning assessments -also play a major role in social functioning <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Tso et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Tso et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Barkus, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Kemp et al., 2025)</ref>. For instance, anxiety about possibility of rejection can result in fewer meaningful relationships or ineffective strategies for managing interpersonal conflict. Furthermore, several disorders known for social dysfunction -such as social anxiety, autism, and schizophrenia -involve elevated negative affect and/or diminished positive affect toward social activities <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Barkus, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Hintzen et al., 2010)</ref>. Therefore, social functioning involves both behavioral and affective factors. Delineating the impact of each is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of social dysfunction in psychopathology.</p><p>In addition to their individual effects, social behaviors and affect interact <ref type="bibr">(Moore &amp; Isen, 1990)</ref>, manifesting broader social dysfunction. For example, social withdrawal or avoidance inherently removes reinforcing aspects of social engagement (e.g., social support, positive affect) and can increase negative expectations or emotions regarding future social interactions (e.g., social anxiety). Decreased enjoyment and increased anxiety about social situations then result in further social withdrawal or avoidance. Over time, these interacting patterns are reciprocally reinforced. Alternatively, each factor may already be detrimental to social functioning. For example, if someone with significant social anxiety tries to engage socially without adequately addressing anxiety (e.g., utilizing "safety" behaviors, such as speaking rarely), they will not experience meaningful interactions that improve social functioning. Clarifying unique and interacting mechanisms of social functioning is therefore necessary for improving understanding of social dysfunction and identifying targets in treatment. Here, we took a crucial first step to examine these relationships at a single point in time. Confirming their cross-sectional relationships will lay the foundation for future research to further characterize and delineate their dynamics temporally.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3.">Goals and Hypotheses</head><p>This study examined the extent to which affect and behavior regarding social activities, and their interaction, contribute to social functioning in a cross-sectional, transdiagnostic sample with varying levels of social dysfunction. We hypothesized each identified component would explain unique variance in social functioning. We expected their interaction would explain additional variance, suggesting a combination of these factors explains social functioning over-and-above either factor alone.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Method</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Participants</head><p>Participants (n=174) ages 18-30 completed psychopathology measures in a study on mechanisms of social dysfunction. However, 30 participants were dropped due to failing to complete at least one measure constituting each of the three examined psychopathology domains, resulting in a final sample of 144 participants. Demographics of the sample are as follows: M age=23.72, SD=3.75; 69.4% female; 20.1% Asian, 4.2% Black/African American; 70.8% White; 4.9% Multiracial; 4.2% Hispanic.</p><p>Eligibility and selection criteria are provided in Supplementary Text 1. Participants were selected across the full range of social dysfunction, from absent/minimal to severe levels of social dysfunction.</p><p>This sampling strategy was employed to capture a broad range of social functioning that cuts across diagnostic statuses, thereby providing an examination not limited to any individual diagnostic category.</p><p>Although participants were not selected based on diagnostic status, this sample was enriched with forms of psychopathology that are highly comorbid and are characterized by prominent social dysfunction. This recruitment strategy ensured recruitment of different social-dysfunction presentations, allowing discernment of shared transdiagnostic features. Specifically, this sample was enriched in social anxiety disorder (n=35), autism spectrum disorder (n=10), psychotic spectrum disorder (n=14), various comorbidities of these diagnoses (n=28), and subclinical levels of these diagnoses (n=19), in addition to a non-clinical group (n=38) identified as having no social dysfunction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Measures and Procedures</head><p>Institutional Review Boards approved this study at the University of Michigan (Reference number: HUM00174935, Approval date: 02/25/2020) and The Ohio State University (Reference number: 2023H0055, Approval date: 04/03/2023). All procedures were performed in compliance with relevant laws and institutional guidelines, and the privacy rights of human subjects have been observed.</p><p>Participants provided informed consent prior to completing the study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.1.">Psychopathology Measures</head><p>This study examines measures capturing three relevant psychopathology dimensions (autism, social anxiety, psychosis proneness). These psychopathology dimensions and measures were selected due to their widely studied overlap with social functioning, and because they capture behavioral (e.g., clinician ratings of one's level of eye contact during social interactions) and affective (e.g., self-report ratings of social anxiety levels) indicators of social responses. Supplementary Text 2 provides a brief description of the training and reliability procedures for clinician-rated measures.</p><p>Autism measures included the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS; <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Hus &amp; Lord, 2014)</ref> and Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ; <ref type="bibr">Baron-Cohen et al., 2001)</ref>. The ADOS is a clinicianadministered measure, whereas the AQ is a self-report measure. Social anxiety measures included the Social Phobia Inventory (SPIN; <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Connor et al., 2000)</ref> and Social Anxiety Disorder Dimensional Scale (SADD; <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">LeBeau et al., 2012)</ref>, which are both self-report format. Psychosis proneness measures included the Peters Delusion Inventory (PDI; <ref type="bibr">Peters et al., 1998)</ref>, Cardiff Anomalous Perception Scale (CAPS; <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bell et al., 2006)</ref>, and Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS; <ref type="bibr">Andreasen, 1984)</ref>. The PDI and CAPS are self-report measures, and the total number of endorsed items on each measure (not other subscores) was used for analyses for consistency with the other psychopathology measures. The SANS is a clinician-rated measure of negative symptoms of schizophrenia-spectrum disorders. Sum scores from each measure were z-scored, and higher scores indicated greater levels of the respective psychopathology characteristic.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.2.">Social Functioning Measures</head><p>Two self-report and two clinician-rated measures of social functioning were administered to provide a comprehensive assessment. Clinician-rated measures of social functioning were the Mental Illness Research, Education, and Clinical Center's Global Assessment of Functioning Social Functioning scale <ref type="bibr">(Niv et al., 2007)</ref> and the Global Functioning: Social subscale <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Cornblatt et al., 2007)</ref>. Higher scores indicate higher social functioning.</p><p>Participants completed two self-report measures of role and social functioning: the Social Adjustment Scale (SAS; <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Gameroff et al., 2012)</ref> and Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS; <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Mundt et al., 2002)</ref>. Although each measure contains items examining role and social functioning, only social items were evaluated to provide a "social functioning" score on each scale. Higher scores indicate lower social functioning, but were re-coded to the opposite direction for consistency of interpretation with the clinician-rated measures.</p><p>Scores on all social functioning measures were z-scored and then averaged to provide a composite social functioning score.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.3.">Intellectual Functioning</head><p>Participants completed the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(McCrimmon &amp; Smith, 2013)</ref>, which examines verbal comprehension and perceptual reasoning. We calculated the Full-Scale IQ-2 (FSIQ2) to provide a score of intellectual functioning or neurocognitive ability. This allowed us to examine whether results were robust to the impact of intellectual functioning, which can also impact social functioning.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.">Statistical Analyses</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.1.">Principal Components Analysis</head><p>Missing values were imputed using Bayesian PCA (pcaMethods package in R) for psychopathology measures and clinician-rated social functioning, respectively. No imputation was needed on self-reported social functioning measures, as all participants completed the SAS and WSAS.</p><p>We conducted a principal components analysis (PCA) on the seven psychopathology measures to extract factors characterizing social difficulties. PCA provided a useful method of parsimoniously integrating distinct but overlapping psychopathology constructs to distinguish unique variance from behavioral and affective contributors to social dysfunction. Using the psych package in R, three components were extracted following examination of scree plots from parallel analysis. These factors accounted for 83% of the total variance in a PCA (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). Upon inspection of the factor structure, two components appeared to capture elevated negative affect regarding social interactions and diminished social engagement, which are the focus of the present study (the third factor reflected psychosis proneness and was not examined further).</p><p>The first component had strongest loadings from the SPIN, SADD, and AQ. Conceptually, this component is primarily characterized by the report of internal experiences regarding everyday, particularly social, tasks. That is, the SPIN and SADD capture self-reported affective responses to social situations. The AQ captures a broad range of autism features, yet emphasizes internal experiences such as social preferences and reactions shared with social anxiety. Thus, this component represents selfreported affective experiences in social situations and is labeled hereafter as Social Negative Affect (SNA). Higher scores indicate greater levels of negative affect or negative internal experiences regarding social situations.</p><p>The second component had the strongest loadings from the ADOS and SANS. The ADOS, which was computed using the recommended revised algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Hus &amp; Lord, 2014)</ref>, emphasizes social communicative skills and behaviors that are exhibited to an interviewer in socially engaging laboratory tasks. The SANS emphasizes diminished interest, motivation, and engagement in social interaction as well as diminished outward affective expression as interpreted by an interviewer in a social research setting. Thus, we conceptualized this second component as representing social behavioral difficulties we now label as Social Disengagement (SD). Higher scores indicate greater levels of social communicative difficulties, and by extension, lower levels of social engagement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.2.">Hierarchical Regression Analysis</head><p>We used hierarchical regression analysis to examine SNA and SD's independent contributions and interaction in predicting social functioning. SNA and SD were entered at Step 1 to evaluate their respective contributions to social functioning, and their interaction term was entered at Step 2 to evaluate its contribution above-and-beyond the main effects. To ensure that differences in social functioning were not better explained by neurocognitive difficulties that co-occur with psychopathology, we repeated these analyses while controlling for FSIQ2 scores.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Descriptive Statistics</head><p>Descriptives for all measures are provided in Supplementary Table <ref type="table">2</ref>. As expected, participants scored across a broad range of psychopathology severity and social functioning.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Contributions of SNA and SD to Social Functioning</head><p>Results of hierarchical regression analyses are presented in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>. When entered at Step 1, SNA (β=-.57) and SD (β=-.37) each explained significant variance in social functioning, totaling 46.3% of variance, all p's &lt; .001. At Step 2, their interaction explained additional variance (β=.19, Δr 2 =2.9%, p=.006). Thus, elevated levels of SNA and SD each statistically predicted worse social functioning, and their positive interaction indicated a less-than-additive effect on social functioning (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). All results remained unchanged when we controlled for IQ at Step 1 (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">3</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p>Behavioral engagement and affective responses to social situations are known to impact social functioning, which is supported by this study. Examining both simultaneously offers a more comprehensive understanding of social dysfunction in psychopathology; for example, our results show that when there are elevated difficulties in both social-behavioral engagement and social-affective experience, their combined impact on social functioning is smaller than expected from their individual effects. This may reflect a suppression effect where the effect of each factor becomes less harmful when both are present, indicating substantially overlapping (but not redundant) dysfunction between these components.</p><p>Although definitions of social functioning more explicitly include behavioral engagement, it has been long understood that negative affect also impacts quality of life and functioning <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Tso et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Tso et al., 2012)</ref>. Dominant cognitive-behavioral perspectives characterize social functioning as arising from combinations of behaviors, thoughts, and emotions in response to a social interaction. For example, experiencing social rejection may result in thoughts about not being likable and increase anxiety in social situations, leading to social withdrawal. In turn, these reactions and outcomes are likely to reinforce each other, such that continued social avoidance results in missed opportunities for contradictory evidence, more persistent beliefs about being unlikeable, and ultimately worse social anxiety. The cognitive modeling literature (e.g., Fulawka &amp; Pachur, 2024) expands upon this, showing that affective responses a person expects to have are a stronger motivator of behavior than monetary outcomes. Moreover, this may be particularly evident for anticipated negative affect and diminished anticipated positive affect, which are relevant to social isolation. These conceptualizations align with our results in that these distinct behavioral and affective experiences may be so intertwined that, once social functioning drops due to either factor, difficulties in the other factor have a smaller additional impact. Therefore, our results provide some delineation of when behavioral engagement and affective experience matter most for social functioning and provide information about specific, personalized points of intervention. Failure to consider both behavioral and cognitive/affective features of social difficulties contributes to inadequate treatment of social dysfunction in psychiatric populations. In cases where social dysfunction is identified, providers must be wary to consider and address both social negative affect and social disengagement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Limitations and Future Directions</head><p>Many factors contribute to the heterogeneity of social dysfunction <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Yanos &amp; Moos, 2007)</ref>. This study examined behavioral and affective contributors, but not their interaction with other relevant factors, such as social ability (i.e., social cognition). For example, diminished social cognition may correspond with inaccurate interpretations of others' internal states (e.g., interpreting neutral expressions as threatening) and/or receiving more negative responses from others (e.g., conflict), which each can correspond with subsequent negative affective experiences and social disengagement.</p><p>Therefore, future studies should evaluate how unique, overlapping, and interacting factors across multiple levels predict social dysfunction. Additionally, studies would benefit from recruiting larger samples of different diagnostic groups, to examine whether the impact of behavioral and affective social difficulties on social functioning differs based on diagnostic status.</p><p>Although this study delineates the impact of behavioral engagement, affect, and their interaction on social functioning, we cannot determine causality given its cross-sectional design.</p><p>However, the reciprocal relationship among these factors is conceptualized to unfold over time. Thus, future research should examine temporal relationships of these factors in clinical versus non-clinical populations to better disentangle their effect on social functioning. For example, if an individual has high levels of social negative affect, it is understandable that they may isolate more, leading to fewer social contacts and diminished social engagement over time. Nonetheless, this cross-sectional study builds upon prior work showing that negative affect in social situations uniquely impacts social functioning <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Kemp et al., 2025)</ref> and provides preliminary support for conducting more complex examinations. </p></div>
