<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This work introduces the concept of an "experiential space", a space of all possible sensory experiences. Indeed, an experience is represented as a point in "experiential space" and is given by the output of a "binding function" applied to the solution to a neural network coding equation, introduced in "Predicate Coding" (Bonal, 2025,[3]), for the sensory nervous system at a given time.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>There is a fundamental difficulty, in the fields of neuroscience, psychology and cognitive science, to describe how different properties of perception, through different sensory modalities, yield a single unified conscious experience. This is often labeled the "Neural Binding Problem". Such a difficulty, however, comes with nuances. Indeed, Feldman (2012, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>), divided the issue in the four distinct problems:</p><p>1. General Coordination 2. Visual Feature-Binding 3. Variable Binding 4. Subjective Unity of Perception This work provides a mathematical model aiming to address "4. ", i.e. the "Subjective Unity of Perception", which Revonsuo (1999, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>) defines as follows: "How are [...] phenomenally unified entities, constructed by the brain as neurally unique entities, considering that the neural mechanisms necessary for creating different phenomenal contents (e.g., color, movement, vision, audition, touch) are distributed all around the cortex." - <ref type="bibr">(Revonsuo, 1999, [17]</ref>) .</p><p>In order to do address this issue, this work builds upon "Predicate Coding" <ref type="bibr">(Bonal, 2025,[3]</ref>), to bind the stimuli-encoded values yielded by the sensory nervous system during a given time interval, to a trajectory in "experiential space", i.e. the space of all possible experiences. In doing so, the model effectively turns a distributed vector of the encoding-neural activity into a singular unified point in experiential "space". This allows to give a formal resolution to neural binding regarding the subjective unity of perception, as it unifies distributed encoding values into a point or trajectory within the space of all possible experiences. It is to be noted, however, that the suggested answer to the "Subjective Unity of Perception" presented here is aiming to resolve a formal issue, i.e. how can such unity be mathematically and computationally assessed, not the mechanistic issue of surrounding such subjective unity.</p><p>There have been several approaches aiming to resolve the neural binding problem, including the "synchronization hypothesis" (von der Malsburg and Schneider, 1986, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>), feature integration theory <ref type="bibr">(Treisman, 1998, [21]</ref>) (Treisman and Gelade, 1980, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>), and the enhancement of firing rates <ref type="bibr">(Roelfsema, 2023, [18]</ref>). However, these approaches mainly address "1-3.", and "4. " is often disregarded as too philosophical and empirically intractable.</p><p>Yet, some theories of consciousness, have aimed to address more firmly the problems arising from subjective unity of perception from a distributed neural system. For instance, through Integrated Information Theory, Balduzzi and Tononi <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Balduzzi and Tononi, 2009</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>), have defined a "qualia space", which aims to assess the "quality" of an experience, and thereby also addressing its unity. The "experiential space" introduced in this work is rooted in a Neural Encoding model, not a consciousness model, whereas the "qualia space" (Balduzzi and Tononi, 2009, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>) is rooted in Integrated Information Theory <ref type="bibr">(Tononi, 2004, [20]</ref>), which does not directly address neural encoding.</p><p>Finally, when understanding the experiential space as a readout of neural activity it bears similarity to "representational similarity analysis" (Kriegeskorte et al., 2008, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>) (Dimsdale-Zucker et al., 2018, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>), "neural population geometry" <ref type="bibr">(Chung et al., 2021,[6]</ref>) <ref type="bibr">(Chen et al., 2025, [5]</ref>) and "perceptual manifolds" <ref type="bibr">(Seung et al., 2000, [19]</ref>) <ref type="bibr">(Chung et al., 2018, [7]</ref>), as it aims to translate neural activity into formal descriptions of sensory experience. However, the mapping from neural activity to the "experiential space" is here done through the framework of Predicate Coding <ref type="bibr">(Bonal, 2025, [3]</ref>), which holds precise ontological commitments, and assigns predicate values to each neuron at a given time, therefore understanding neural activity through the lens of such predicates, in a deterministic way. Nonetheless, elements of each of those models, appear within the "experiential space": (i) the process relating neural activity to meaningful and computationally tractable values builds upon insights provided by representational similarity analysis <ref type="bibr">(Kriegeskorte et al., 2008, [12]</ref>) (Dimsdale-Zucker et al., 2018, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>), (ii) the concept of an "experiential space", containing all possible experiences yielded by neural activity builds upon insights provided by both neural population geometry <ref type="bibr">(Chung et al., 2021,[6]</ref>) <ref type="bibr">(Chen et al., 2025, [5]</ref>) and perceptual manifolds (Seung et al., 2000, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>) <ref type="bibr">(Chung et al., 2018, [7]</ref>) . Yet, none of the formalism of any of these models appear in this work, as it borrows its formalism and fundamental ontology from Predicate Coding <ref type="bibr">(Bonal, 2025, [3]</ref>).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Background</head><p>The mathematical model introduced in this paper aims to describe how different encoding values, coming from different neurons, yield the unity of sensory experience, In order to do so, the model will rest upon "Predicate coding" <ref type="bibr">(Bonal, 2025, [3]</ref>), according to which each neuron is tuned to properties of stimuli which can be represented by many-valued logic predicates with fuzzy logic (≈Åukasiewicz) semantics.</p><p>The model will here first describe the sensory nervous system as a network of interconnected neurons, each tuned to many-valued logic predicates applied to stimuli.

Moreover, an experience E at a time interval [t 0 , t n ] is trajectory a through the experiential space.

Indeed, let us define the output of Code (1) (net sensory.[t,t+k] , x) as a tuple of values Œ∫ i , each corresponding to a neuron in the vertices set V sensory.[t,t+k] of the sensory nervous system network:</p><p>Code (1) </p><formula xml:id="formula_19">(net sensory.[t,t+k] , x) = (Œ∫ 1 , ..., Œ∫ |V sensory.[t,t+k] | )<label>(19)</label></formula><p>Where </p><p>Such that A is to be assessed experimentally, with neurons neur u.[t,t+k] in V sensory.[t,t+k] significantly correlating (p &lt; 0.005) with the presentation of stimuli with high-valued P i.j in P set (P i.j (x) ‚â• 0.8 ).</p><p>Finally, B is defined as the tuple of dimensions of experiential space e P i.j</p><p>where each P i.j is a predicate in P set , such tuple yields an experience point E t i : B(Code (1) (net sensory.[t,t+k] , x)) = (e P i.j</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">) P i.j ‚ààPset = E t i<label>(21)</label></formula><p>Moreover, in order to ensure that the values from Code (1) (net sensory.[t,t+k] , x), which are in [0, 1] V sensory.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p>The mathematical model introduced in this work allows for a description of a unified sensory experience, from neural activity analyzed through the lens of Predicate Coding <ref type="bibr">(Bonal, 2025, [3]</ref>). Indeed, it aims to provide a mathematical solution to the fourth instance of Feldman's Neural Binding Problem taxonomy (2012, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>), i.e. the subjective unity of perception, through the unification of diverse neural activity throughout the sensory nervous system, into a coherent unified experience, as a trajectory within "experiential space". However, while this model gives a mathematical readout from neural activity to phenomenal sensory experience, a major mystery still remains: the causal link between neural activity and phenomenal experience, which can be seen as a instantiation of the philosophical mind-body problem <ref type="bibr">(Chalmers, 1997, [4]</ref>) <ref type="bibr">(Descartes, 1641, [8]</ref>).</p><p>Indeed, one could aim to treat Binding function B as more than just a readout, and understood as a form of "communicative" link between the sensory nervous system and and an abstract experience, yielding phenomenal perception. However, if one aims to interpret the mathematics presented in this work in such a way, one problem arises: How can such link instantiate itself in an experimentally discoverable manner? For instance, the communicative link between motor neurons in the brain and voluntary somatic control can be traced back to corticospinal tracts <ref type="bibr">(Heffner et al., 2008, [11]</ref>) <ref type="bibr">(Ueno et al., 2018, [23]</ref>) <ref type="bibr">(Usuda et al., 2022, [24]</ref>). Presuming the existence of such a link would either require a complete reductionist approach, reducing phenomenal activity to neural activity, which would partly dismiss the problem rather than answer it, or accepting the existence of a link between a physiological process (neural encoding) and an abstract experiential space, which is empirically challenging and hard to falsify.</p><p>Hence, while this model aims to provide a clear mathematically solution to the presence of a unity of phenomenological sensory experience from diverse neural encodings, if one aims to extend the purpose of this readout to serve as "communicative" link, the philosophical mind-body problem arises.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_1"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>, |V sensory.[t,t+k] | is the cardinality of V sensory.[t,t+k] , and each Œ∫ i is the code for neuron neur u.[t,t+k] in V sensory.[t,t+k] .
