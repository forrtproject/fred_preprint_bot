<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Several affective and clinical theories argue that our thoughts and feelings are tightly intertwined, such that changing how we think changes how we feel. For example, constructionist theories posit that emotions arise from a combination of physiological arousal and its cognitive interpretation <ref type="bibr">(Schacter &amp; Singer, 1962;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Barrett, 2006)</ref>, and appraisal theories contend that cognitive appraisals of events, agents, or objects trigger emotional experiences <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Clore, Ortony, &amp; Collins, 1988</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Gross's (1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">2015)</ref> process model of emotion regulation extends these ideas by illustrating how reinterpreting (i.e., reappraising) one's situation can alter the downstream experience and expression of emotion. Clinically, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Beck's (1967)</ref> cognitive theory argues that maladaptive thought processes (especially about oneself, the world, and the future) contribute to depression. Substantial empirical data support each of these theoretical accounts. Cognitions are indeed more negative in depressed than non-depressed individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Gotlib &amp; Joormann, 2010)</ref>, identical physiological arousal can yield different emotional and behavioral reactions depending on one's cognitive interpretations <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Schachter &amp; Singer, 1962;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Lindquist &amp; Barrett, 2008)</ref>, and cognitive reappraisal is highly effective at reducing negative emotions across self-reported, neural, and physiological levels of analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Lazarus &amp; Alfert, 1964;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Gross, 2002</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Gross, , 2015;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Webb et al, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Ochsner et al, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Buhle et al, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Morawetz et al, 2016)</ref>. Indeed, use of reappraisal has been linked to greater psychological wellbeing, positive affect, and mental health <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Gross &amp; John 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Dawel et al, 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Kam et al, 2024)</ref>, and it is a key therapeutic strategy used in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Beck, 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Despite this robust evidence, recent work has raised important questions about how emotional change is measured in reappraisal studies. More specifically, our typical strategies for measuring affective states may insufficiently attend to subtle distinctions between different types of valence (i.e., the negativity or positivity of one's affective state, a core dimension of emotion; <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Barrett, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Russell et al, 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Watson &amp; Tellegen, 1985)</ref>. Recent work has decomposed valence into two empirically dissociable constructs: Affective valence, or the hedonic quality of an emotional experience, and semantic valence, or the cognitive evaluation of a situation as positive or negative <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Itkes et al, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Itkes et al, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Hamzani et al, 2020)</ref>. Notably, when participants are explicitly asked to rate either affective or semantic valence, their responses diverge. For example, ratings of affective valence better predict physiological responses (e.g. heart rate, facial EMG, and electrodermal activity) to affective stimuli than ratings of semantic valence <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Hamzani et al, 2020)</ref>, and ratings of affective valence (as well as associated physiological responses) habituate over repeated exposure to emotional images, whereas semantic ratings do not <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Itkes et al, 2017)</ref>.</p><p>To date, cognitive reappraisal studies have not attended to these different constructs. In fact, there is high variability in how studies measure reappraisal effectiveness (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). Many studies ask participants to report "how they feel" or "how negative their emotional experience is" <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Ochsner et al, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Adam et al, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Morawetz et al, 2016)</ref>. Although this may seem to capture affective valence, this instruction unfortunately may not sufficiently coach participants to rate only their emotional experiences rather than their cognitive evaluations of stimuli. In fact, when valence rating instructions are "ambiguous" as to semantic or affective valence, ratings fall between affective and semantic ratings rather than aligning with affective valence <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Hamzani et al, 2020)</ref>. In contrast, some cognitive reappraisal studies seem to assess semantic (rather than affective) valence, as they ask the participants to rate how positively/negatively they evaluate the stimulus <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Phan et al 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Van Reekum et al, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr">Winecoff et al, 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Given that these subtle differences in wording track empirically dissociable constructs (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Itkes et al, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Hamzani et al, 2020)</ref>, this methodological variability is not trivial in the conclusions we draw from these studies. Specifically, we do not know 1) whether reappraisal changes both affective and semantic valence, or 2) the extent to which default valence rating instructions in reappraisal tasks measure affective experiences or cognitive evaluations. This draws into question how strongly we can assume that cognitive reappraisal designs assess changes in participants' actual emotional experiences, the construct that most studies are presumed to test.</p><p>Here we address this gap through two preregistered studies (Study 1: osf.io/varht, Study 2: osf.io/6etx8) in which participants completed classic cognitive reappraisal tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Ochsner et al, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Nook et al, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr">2021)</ref>, but we manipulated (between-subjects in Study 1 and within-subjects in Study 2) whether participants reported on their affective valence, semantic valence, or default/ambiguous valence (using instructions commonly used in cognitive reappraisal research). We preregistered the hypotheses that cognitive reappraisal would reduce negative and increase positive valence ratings across all conditions, but reappraisal will more strongly influence semantic valence ratings than affective valence ratings. Addressing how reappraisal affects these different types of valence ratings can guide methods used in reappraisal studies, provide further evidence that affective and semantic valence are dissociable constructs, and eventually improve our understanding of which interventions might shift internal feeling states. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head><p>Participants. Two hundred and five participants were recruited on Prolific. Fifty participants were excluded due to failing preregistered attention checks, leaving N = 155 usable participants (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref> for demographics). However, for transparency, results using the full sample are shown in Supplemental Materials. The pattern of results was replicated using the full sample, mitigating concerns that these exclusions biased results. Preregistered attention checks consisted of randomized scale instructions (e.g., "Please select the rating all the way to the left") embedded within the valence rating trials. Participants were eligible if they were 18 years or older, fluent in English, located in the United States, and had at least a 95% approval rating on previous tasks. Participants were randomly assigned to the affective (N = 50), default (N = 54), or semantic (N = 51) conditions (detailed below).</p><p>We set our target sample size through a power analysis using the pwr package in R <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Champely, 2020)</ref>. To achieve 80% power (at α = .05), prior work suggested that a sample size of 19 would be required to detect differences in self-reports of affective and semantic valence in response to repeated exposure <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Itkes et al, 2017</ref>; η²p = 0.314), and a sample size of 15 would be required to detect a main effect of reappraisal <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Nook et al, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr">η²p = 0.37)</ref>  In the affective condition, participants were presented with the definition of affective valence (i.e. the hedonic value of an image, or how the image makes subjects feel). Participants were instructed to distinguish between the positivity/negativity of their feelings and the positivity/negativity of the image's content and to report specifically on their feelings while viewing the image. For example, if participants knew that the picture had negative content but they did not feel anything, they were instructed to report that they did not experience strong feelings. In the semantic condition, participants were presented with the definition of semantic valence (i.e. a cognitive evaluation of how positive or negative the content of the image is).</p><p>Again, participants were instructed to distinguish between what they felt and what the image's content and to report only how positively/negatively they judged the content of the image to be, regardless of how they felt. In the Default condition, participants did not receive specific instructions on either of these two constructs. Instead, they were simply asked to rate how positive or negative they felt in response to each image, which is a common way of measuring valence in reappraisal studies (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Krendl et al, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Hayes et al, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Nook et al, 2021)</ref>.</p><p>After receiving their assigned Valence Instructions, all participants completed a classic cognitive reappraisal task where they rated their affective responses to pictorial stimuli from the Open Affective Standardized Image Set (OASIS; <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Kurdi et al, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Ochsner et al, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Nook et al, 2021</ref>; Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>). Two image sets (20 images each) were used, and we counterbalanced assignment of list to conditions. These sets were reproduced from <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Nook et al (2020)</ref> and were matched on valence (p =.899), arousal (p =.750), and content (for more information, see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">S1</ref> of <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Nook et al, 2020)</ref>. As such, each participant rated 40 images in total (20 in the Reappraisal condition and 20 in the Look condition), and no participant viewed the same image more than once.</p><p>On Look trials, participants saw the word LOOK above an image, instructing them to simply view the images and provide valence ratings according to their assigned valence condition. On reappraisal trials, participants saw the word CHANGE above the image, instructing them to reinterpret the meaning of each image in a way that made them feel better.</p><p>Each image was displayed for 10 seconds, after which participants had 4 seconds to provide their negative rating, and 4 seconds to provide their positive rating. The screen proceeded if they had not responded in this time, leading to some missing data (average of 9.29% of trials in Study 1, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>). Between trials, participants viewed a fixation cross for 5 seconds. The order of the images, Look/Change conditions, and rating scales (positive/negative) was randomized.</p><p>Following the experiment, all participants completed a set of questionnaires and demographic questions.</p><p>Table <ref type="table">3</ref>.

These analyses were conducted separately for positive ratings and negative ratings. Both models included a random intercept for participant ID to nest trial-level ratings within participants. We then subjected this model to an ANOVA to determine main effects and interactions of each of our factors. Although we preregistered analyzing negative and positive valence ratings separately, we observed that these were strongly correlated within-subject (r = -.70, p &lt; .001)</p><p>and that results overall did not differ across them. We thus present these results in the Supplemental Materials and in the main text present analyses of "unidimensional valence", which was calculated by subtracting trial-level negative ratings from positive ratings. Thus more positive unidimensional ratings indicate more positive affect and more negative unidimensional ratings indicate more negative affect.</p><p>We hypothesized a significant main effect of Reappraisal, such that ratings would be less negative/more positive in the Change condition than the Look condition. In addition, we expected to see a significant Reappraisal x Valence Instructions interaction, indicating that the framing of the instructions impacted the outcomes of reappraisal. We interpreted the findings of the Reappraisal x Valence Instructions interaction with a specific focus on whether reappraisal had a greater impact on changing semantic ratings over affective ratings following reappraisal.</p><p>We conducted contrast analyses to compare reappraisal effects across conditions. We hypothesized that reappraisal would lead to the greatest changes in Semantic valence, smallest changes in Affective valence, and that the Default condition would be between these two. We based this latter hypothesis on the notion that cognitive reappraisal primarily involves changing the way participants construe the meaning of the image <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Gross, 1998)</ref>, but reappraisal may be less effective at modulating core physiological responding that forms the ingredients of hedonic experiences <ref type="bibr">(Troy et al, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Hamzani et al, 2020)</ref>.</p></div>

Forty participants were excluded due to preregistered attention checks, leaving N = 105 usable participants (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref> for demographics). However, for transparency, the results using the full sample are shown in Supplemental Materials. The overall pattern of results was the same in the unfiltered sample, however, the interaction only marginally significant (p = .054), likely reflecting the poor data quality of participants who failed attention checks (see Supplemental Materials for more information). As in Study 1, attention checks consisted of randomized scale instructions (e.g., "Please select the rating all the way to the left") embedded within the valence rating trials. Participants were eligible if they were 18 years or older, fluent in English, located in the United States, and had at least a 95% approval rating on previous tasks.</p><p>Using 80% power and α = .05, our a priori power analyses indicated that a sample size of 35 would be required to detect within-subjects differences in self-reports of affective and semantic valence <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Olteanu et al, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr">η²p = 0.19)</ref>, and a sample size of 15 would be required to detect within-subjects differences due to reappraisal <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Nook et al, 2021</ref>; η²p = 0.37). However,  <ref type="table">3</ref>). However, in Study 2 participants were instructed to provide both affective and semantic ratings for all stimuli.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">to</formula><p>Only one set of OASIS images <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Kurdi et al, 2017)</ref> from Study 1 (20 images) was used for this study, as all participants saw these 20 images twice, once in a baseline passive viewing phase and once in a reappraisal phase (adapted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Nook et al., 2021</ref>; Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>). In the Passive Viewing phase, participants were instructed to simply view the images and provide affective and semantic valence ratings (one for negative, one for positive). After participants provided their baseline ratings, they completed the second Reappraisal phase. Participants were instructed to reinterpret the meaning of each image in a way that made them feel better before providing their ratings. Each image was displayed for 10 seconds, after which participants had 8 seconds to provide their affective or semantic ratings (separate scales for positive and negative valence), and 8 seconds to provide the remaining valence ratings (semantic/affective; separate scales for positive and negative valence). The interstimulus interval was 5 seconds. Trial order and order of affective/semantic ratings were randomized for each subject within each condition. Following the experiment, all participants completed a set of questionnaires and demographic questions.</p><p>Analyses. To test our preregistered research questions, we conducted linear mixed effects analyses of unidimensional trial-level valence ratings, with Reappraisal (Look vs Change: within-subjects) and Valence Instructions (Affective vs Semantic: within-subjects) as predictors. Given that results did not differ across negative and positive ratings in Study 1, we shifted our preregistered analyses to focus on unidimensional ratings, calculated by subtracting the negative ratings from positive ratings. We again expected to see a significant main effect of Reappraisal, indicating less negative/higher positive ratings in the Change condition than the Look condition across Valence Instructions. In addition, we expected to see a significant interaction between Reappraisal and Valence Instructions, showing that the framing of the instructions impacts the outcomes of reappraisal. We focused our interpretation of this interaction on our hypothesis that reappraisal would have a greater impact on changing semantic ratings over affective ratings. We conducted contrast analyses to compare reappraisal effects across conditions. For thoroughness, we present exploratory analyses of negative and positive ratings separately in the Supplemental Materials.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>When we ask people to change their thoughts to change their feelings (i.e., use cognitive reappraisal), does it matter what we measure when determining their regulatory success? Here we integrated cognitive reappraisal research with recent insights into the complexities of valence <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Itkes et al, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Hamzani et al, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Wang et al, 2021)</ref>. Across two preregistered studies, we found that reappraisal more strongly influenced semantic valence ratings (i.e., cognitive evaluations of images) than affective valence ratings (i.e., hedonic experiences). Additionally, "default" valence ratings (i.e., instructions used in prior studies)</p><p>behaved more like semantic than affective valence ratings. Effects replicated across withinperson and between-person designs. These results (i) provide additional evidence that cognitive evaluations and affective experiences are distinct facets of valence, (ii) demonstrate that this distinction has deep implications for how we measure and interpret valence change in reappraisal studies and (iii) spur new directions for emotion regulation research.</p><p>One possible explanation for increased malleability of semantic evaluations is that reappraisal primarily operates through reinterpretation processes which directly target semantic representations. Thus, reappraisal may be more effective at changing what an event means than how it feels, highlighting a potential dissociation between affective and cognitive aspects of emotion regulation. This aligns with recent work distinguishing between generation and implementation of reappraisals <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Waugh et al, 2022)</ref>. Reappraisal generation involves creating new interpretations of a situation, whereas reappraisal implementation involves applying them to modify one's emotional response. Our findings may reflect these stages, such that participants more easily and effectively generate reappraisals that shift how they think about stimuli, but the implementation of reappraisals to change their feelings is on average harder, slower, and/or less effective. Future work could more directly test whether reappraisal generation affects only semantic representations, while reappraisal implementation also extends to affective experiences.</p><p>A second explanation for our results is that affective ratings tap participants' core affect (i.e., one's constantly internal affective state integrating bodily, contextual, and cognitive inputs; <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Russell, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Barrett, 2017)</ref>. If affective ratings reflect the sum of many different contributors beyond one's appraisal of just one visual stimulus, we would expect that changing just that one input would yield a smaller change in affect than in their evaluation of that stimulus. Indeed, the process model of emotion regulation emphasizes reappraisal as changing the stimulus meaning, but also acknowledges that affective experience is influenced by current experience (attention, bodily state; <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Gross, 2015)</ref>. Consistent with this, research indicates that affective experiences are not only shaped by cognitive processes, but also by trait factors, stress, and situational demands <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Aldao &amp; Dixon-Gordon, 2014)</ref>. Together, these accounts provide initial explanations why reappraisal may more readily influence semantic evaluations than hedonic affect, but these prompt further research on the mechanisms by which reinterpretations translate (or fail to translate) to core affective states.</p><p>We also found in Study 1 that "default" instructions behave more like semantic than affective ratings. Even though the instructions we used asked participants to report how they feel, when we did not specify between affective and semantic valence, participants' responses seem to reflect semantic more than affective ratings. This suggests that prior studies that did not provide such a distinction for their participants likely overestimated how strongly reappraisal modifies actual affect. This has many important implications. For example, clinical and at-risk samples have shown small or inconsistent differences from healthy controls in their reappraisal success in tasks like these <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Visted et al, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Picó-Pérez et al, 2017)</ref>, and recent work has suggested that reappraisal capacity is unrelated to depressive and anxiety symptoms <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Andrews et al, 2023)</ref>. This contrasts with theoretical accounts that emphasize reappraisal as a key vulnerability factor in psychopathology and assume reappraisal efficacy differs between clinical and healthy populations <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Beck, 1967;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Beck &amp; Clark, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Aldao, Nolen-Hoeksema, &amp; Schweizer, 2010)</ref>. If default valence ratings primarily reflect cognitive evaluations, these discrepancies may stem from measurement issues. Recognizing this distinction is critical for interpreting past findings and improving future research on emotion regulation in clinical samples.</p><p>Our results also add to the growing body of work showing that semantic and affective valence are dissociable (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Itkes et al, 2017</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Itkes et al, , 2019;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Hamzani et al, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Wang et al, 2021)</ref>.</p><p>Thus, reappraisal appears to be a "wedge" scholars can use to dissociate these constructs. In addition, in Study 2 we observed that semantic valence ratings were overall more negative than affective valence ratings, revealing that at baseline, images were evaluated as more negative than they were experienced. These findings suggest that affective/semantic distinctions are important even when estimating normative emotional responses to stimuli: Images may "appear" to have greater impact on felt emotional experiences than they actually do, depending on rating instructions.</p><p>Although our findings highlight the importance of distinguishing semantic from affective valence in emotion regulation, our study is not without limitations. First, we used staged, standardized images as stimuli. Although this approach gives us strong experimental control, it does not reflect the complexity and personal meaning of real-life situations that are often autobiographical and socially situated. In addition, we used Prolific to recruit our participants.</p><p>Although our sample was well-balanced on gender, it lacked diversity with regard to characteristics such as age, nationality, cultural background, race, and ethnicity. Therefore, our findings may not generalize to broader populations. Finally, our results relied on self-report measures, which are subject to biases in introspection and demand characteristics. Even though self-report is the most commonly assessed measure of emotion, incorporating physiological and behavioral indices could provide a more comprehensive image of how reappraisal influences affective experiences.</p><p>These findings open promising directions for future research. Although not directly tested here, our results raise intriguing questions about how semantic and affective representations of valence interact at the individual level. In particular, the "alignment" of semantic and affective representations may have implications for emotion regulation and mental health. For example, individuals with depression and anxiety tend to maintain both persistent negative affect and negatively biased interpretations <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Gotlib &amp; Joormann, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Everaert et al, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Hirsch et al, 2016)</ref>, suggesting that coupling between feeling and evaluation could be relevant to psychopathology. Moreover, individual differences in interoceptive accuracy and focus <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Garfinkel et al, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Murphy et al, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Ainley &amp; Tsakiris, 2013)</ref> may influence how closely these processes align. Clarifying the role of semantic-affective alignment thus represents an important new direction for understanding variability in emotion regulation efficacy and vulnerability to affective disorders.</p><p>To conclude, recognizing that semantic and affective shifts in emotion regulation can dissociate underscores the need for more precise assessments of reappraisal outcomes and for interventions that target both affective and cognitive components of emotion. Future research should examine how individual differences, such as psychopathology or semantic-affective coupling, influence reappraisal ability and whether modifying the alignment between semantic and affective representations of valence serves as a mechanism of effective emotion regulation.</p></div>

The order will vary across trials, so pay attention to which one you're answering!</figDesc><table /><note><p>[two practice trials]</p></note></figure>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Practice instructions</head><p>For this experiment, you will see a series of images and be asked to rate [how they make you feel / how they make you feel / what you think of them.] Each image will be presented along with either the word LOOK or the word CHANGE above the image. These are instructions that ask you to interact with the image in a certain way, and we'll teach you what they mean. Let's walk through an example!</p><p>Look/Change practice [put up picture with LOOK above] Here is a picture with the word LOOK above it. LOOK means you should simply observe the image naturally. Don't try to change your reactions at all.</p><p>[put up picture with CHANGE above] Here is another picture with the word CHANGE above it. CHANGE means you should try to make yourself feel better about the image by reinterpreting the scene so that it means something different to you. For example, you can create a story or context around the image that changes how you feel about it. Try doing that now.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Practice instructions 1) Valence instructions (affective/semantic)</head><p>In this experiment you will see two sets of pictures. In this first set, we want you to make a set of ratings about the picture. Each picture contains a scene or event, and we will ask you to report 1) how positive or negative you feel when looking at the picture and 2) how positive or negative the event in the picture is.</p><p>Your ratings should reflect how you feel and think when you see the image, without trying to change your feelings or thoughts.</p><p>Now, making ratings like these are not always easy, as it's not always clear what to report about when asked these questions. In these instructions we will explain to you what we mean when we ask you to report about your feelings and the picture.</p><p>We want you to rate two different things: 1) how you feel inside and 2) what you think about the meaning of the picture. We want you to distinguish between these things and rate each of them on different scales. 1) When we ask you to rate how negative/positive you feel, we only want you to rate the actual feeling that you experienced inside while viewing the picture, not what you expected to feel or what you think about the contents of the image. 2) When we ask you how negative/positive the image is, we only want you to rate the picture's contents, regardless of your feelings about those contents.</p><p>Let's walk through an example. You might look at a picture of a car accident and not feel strong emotions inside, but you might think that car accidents are negative scenes. On this trial, then, you should rate little negativity when we ask how you feel, but you would give a higher negativity rating when we ask what you think about the picture.</p><p>In addition to rating negativity, you will also be rating positivity. So you will make 4 ratings for each picture.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2) Rating scales practice</head><p>Now we'll let you practice using the rating scales. You will have 8 seconds to respond to each.</p><p>[put up rating scales]</p></div>
