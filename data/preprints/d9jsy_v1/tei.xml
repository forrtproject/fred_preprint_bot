<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Food sustains human life, but household food consumption impacts negatively on the environment. Therefore, many studies in the literature focus on sustainable food consumption. However, these studies are quite fragmented and study only some aspects of food consumption. By applying the thematic analysis approach to available studies in the literature, this research aims to build a framework covering all three phases of food consumption: the acquisition phase (purchasing ingredients), usage phase (cooking, eating, sharing leftover food), and disposal phase (food waste). The framework proposed in this research can become a more comprehensive reference source for future studies in sustainable food consumption topics. In specific, policymakers can use this framework to design effective campaigns/policies to promote sustainable food consumption practices of their residents. Future researchers can reference this framework to conduct more comprehensive studies on sustainable food consumption topics.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Trends of the increasing global population, rising extreme climate, decreasing agricultural labour, and reducing agricultural land have been pressing huge strains on the food systems all over the world. To ensure food security and healthy diets for future generations, it is more necessary than ever to transform food systems toward sustainability. A food system includes all activities relating to the whole process from productionprocessing -distribution -preparation -and consumption of food <ref type="bibr">(FAO, 2020)</ref>. Among those stages, food consumption is one of the most important ones. On the global scope, food consumption has serious implications for both public health and environmental quality <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Carrus et al., 2018)</ref>. However, the current food consumption behaviours have many sustainability challenges.</p><p>To answer the research question "What factors should researchers/policymakers take into consideration when studying/investigating sustainable food consumption behaviours of households?", I use the thematic analysis approach to review studies in the literature. After reviewing relevant studies in the literature, I found many of them focus on the acquisition phase of food consumption. In specific, they studied sustainable food choices or purchasing behaviours, e.g., attitude toward sustainable products, the intention or actual purchasing organic food/ local food, fair trade products, etc. Another major trend of these studies is sustainable eating patterns, for example, reducing (red) meat consumption, moving toward a plant-based diet, substituting meat with hybrid meats, or vegetarian motivations, etc. Some recent studies also focus on household food waste while only a few studies the usage phase of food consumption.</p><p>Consumption is not exhausted in mere purchases of products or services <ref type="bibr">(Geiger et al., 2018)</ref>. It means that sustainable food consumption is not simply by purchasing (or intent to purchase) sustainable food products. What if a high percentage of organic and local products -considered sustainable food -are bought by consumers and then end up in a bin (food waste)? And what if the "sustainable" ingredients are cooked by an "unsustainable" method (e.g., waste too much energy when cooking)? We cannot simply conclude that the food consumption behaviour of one consumer is sustainable or unsustainable by just looking at their purchasing behaviour (or even their eating patterns). For this reason, the proposed framework in this research will cover all three phases of food consumption and can become a more comprehensive reference for future researchers/ policymakers when conducting their sustainable food consumption studies/policies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Literature review + Consumers' motivations and their food choices</head><p>After reviewing the literature, Verain et al. summarise factors promoting sustainable food consumption including "health motives, environmental motives, naturalness, and taste" <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Verain et al., 2015)</ref>. It is widely agreed in the literature that when choosing food, consumers will be strongly affected by egoistic motivations such as freshness, healthiness, quality of food, etc. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Annunziata &amp; Mariani, 2018)</ref>. Respondents in the study of <ref type="bibr">Kovacs &amp; Keresztes (2002)</ref> confirmed that freshness, healthy products, and the intrinsic properties of food are important for their food choices <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Kovacs &amp; Keresztes, 2022)</ref>. In addition, food choices are also affected by social and emotional factors <ref type="bibr">(Steenkamp, 1997</ref><ref type="bibr">cited in Kovacs &amp; Keresztes, 2022)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>+ Awareness of sustainable food consumption</head><p>Studies in the literature reveal that consumers lack/ have low awareness of healthy eating and sustainable consumption (de <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Koning et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Gao et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Mancini et al., 2017)</ref>. Most of them are even unaware of the relationship between food consumption and climate change <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Ozkaya et al., 2021)</ref>, for example, only 10% of Americans in the survey of Truelove &amp; Parks recognised the impact of meat consumption on climate change <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Truelove &amp; Parks, 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Consumers tend to overestimate packaging's impacts on the environment. Specifically, they believed decreasing the use of excessive packaging is the most important in sustainable food consumption <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Lea &amp; Worsley, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Mancini et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Tobler et al., 2011)</ref>. On the other hand, they underestimate the effect of meat production on the environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Lazzarini et al., 2016)</ref>, and "only meat products from overseas were seen as very environmentally unfriendly" <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Lazzarini et al., 2016)</ref>. According to Jungbluth, Tietje, &amp; Scholz, compared to the impact of meat production, transportation and packaging of food products are relatively low on the environment (Jungbluth, Tietje, &amp; Scholz, 2000 cited in <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Simeone &amp; Scarpato, 2020)</ref>. Among meat types, beef (and other ruminants) "convert resources less efficiently" than pigs and other poultries: "Three times more feed is needed to produce one kilogram of beef compared to pork and, consequently, more cropland is used" <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Lazzarini et al., 2016)</ref>. However, consumers have a low awareness of this problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Lazzarini et al., 2016)</ref>.</p><p>When investigating the awareness of consumers on organic foods, Lee &amp; Hwang found that "consumers who believe that organic foods are safe and eco-friendly may also believe that overall quality of organic foods is high, which increases value perceptions" <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Lee &amp; Hwang, 2016)</ref>. In their study, Annunziata &amp; Mariani proved that the segment of egocentric-oriented consumers is larger than sustainability-oriented consumers <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Annunziata &amp; Mariani, 2018)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>+ Food credence attribute and product labels</head><p>Studies in the literature reveal that food attributes such as freshness, price, quality, taste, familiarity, convenience <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Hoek et al., 2017)</ref>, safety, naturalness, healthiness, and environmentally friendly <ref type="bibr">(Kovacs et al., 2022)</ref> affect consumers' food choices. Among those attributes, freshness and taste are the most two important ones <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Annunziata &amp; Scarpato, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Campbell-Arvai, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">de Koning et al., 2015)</ref>, followed by price and safety and healthiness <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Kovacs &amp; Keresztes, 2022)</ref>. Environmental and social attributes are considered secondary <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Annunziata &amp; Scarpato, 2014)</ref>. Annunziata and Mariani concluded that consumers are following an egoistic approach and attaching more value to quality and health attributes than environmental and social sustainability <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Annunziata &amp; Mariani, 2018)</ref>. The products' elements that cannot be verified by consumers are called credence attributes. These intangible attributes include environmental safety, product origin, social benefits, production conditions, etc. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Kovacs &amp; Keresztes, 2022)</ref>. "Organic" is also a credence attribute <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Lee &amp; Hwang, 2016)</ref> because consumers cannot evaluate the claimed quality of organic products on their own. Healthy and other sustainability attributes of food products cannot be observed and experienced by consumers, therefore, are credence attributes <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Van Loo et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Since consumers cannot observe credence attributes of sustainable food products (even after their purchasing or consumption), eco-labels play a vital role in promoting these products into the market <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Daugbjerg et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Lazzarini et al., 2016)</ref>. For such reason, food product labelling systems in developed countries are expanding quickly. However, different labelling systems in these developed countries confused consumers <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Hebrok &amp; Heidenstrøm, 2019)</ref> and another problem is the mistrust of consumers on labels <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Annunziata &amp; Scarpato, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Haider et al., 2022)</ref>. Consumers have problems understanding product labels and label does not provide clear indications for their decisions, therefore, they rely on the best-known brands (do not read the label but choose the leading brand) or rely on slogans on the label <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Mancini et al., 2017)</ref>. In some cases, consumers buy food directly from local producers, and labelling becomes unnecessary <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Mancini et al., 2017)</ref>. Time constraint when shopping at stores is one of the main reasons leading to little attention on products' labels; for these consumers, information about the products are obtained via media, newspapers, and the previous phases of consumption <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Mancini et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p>According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Daugbjerg et. al. (2014)</ref>, the product label will have the desired outcome if consumers understand the label's meaning and trust in it <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Daugbjerg et al., 2014)</ref>. Exposing labels in the shop, and perceiving and understanding them is not enough, label information needs to enter into consumers' decisionmaking <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Grunert, 2011)</ref>. Moreover, consumers must not make any inferences beyond what labels mean and buy the products because of these wrong inferences. Although some attributes such as animal welfare, nutritional quality, and no residues. etc. are credence attributes, other attributes such as taste, juiciness, tenderness, etc. are experience characteristics and can be disconfirmed after consumption <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Grunert, 2011)</ref>. In his study, Grunert warned that if consumers infer an eco-label beyond its actual meaning, these inferences will be disconfirmed after their consumption and leading to mistrust of the labels and avoiding sustainable products with eco-labels in the future <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Grunert, 2011)</ref>. In his research, Grunert concluded that "the product must be eco-labelled. But ecolabelling is not enough. Consumers must notice, read and understand the eco-label, and should not make inferences that are too far off with regard to what the label actually stands for" <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Grunert, 2011)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>+ Consumers' attitudes and intentions toward sustainable food consumption</head><p>The theory of reasoned action was first built by <ref type="bibr">Fishbein &amp; Ajzen in 1975.</ref> This theory assumes that human beings usually behave reasonably from their information and beliefs about the particular behaviour of interest <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Fishbein &amp; Ajzen, 2009)</ref>. The theory of reasoned action states that attitude toward the behaviour, perceived norm, and perceived behavioural control of people will form their behavioural intentions. In turn, behavioural intentions predict the actual performance of the behaviour: "the stronger the intention, the more likely it is that the behaviour will be carried out" <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Fishbein &amp; Ajzen, 2009)</ref>. However, lacking actual control (such as a lack of requisite skills and abilities, and the existence of environmental controls) will prevent people from translating their behavioural intentions into actual behaviours <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Fishbein &amp; Ajzen, 2009)</ref>.</p><p>Expanding the theory of reasoned action, in 1985, Ajzen introduced the theory of planned behaviour. In this theory, Ajzen defined behavioural intention as "an intention to try performing a certain behaviour", and successful performance of the intended behaviour "is contingent on the person's control over the various factors that may prevent it", so "intentions can only be expected to predict a person's attempt to perform a behaviour, not necessarily its actual performance" <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Ajzen, 1985)</ref>. In the theory of planned behaviour, behavioural intention is a function of (1) attitude toward trying, and (2) subjective norm about trying; and intention is an immediate determinant of an attempt to perform a behaviour of a person <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Ajzen, 1985)</ref>. Many researchers applied the theory of reasoned action/ the theory of planned behaviour in their sustainable food consumption studies. Therefore, plenty of studies in the literature focus on attitudes, intentions toward the behaviours, and intentionbehaviour gaps.</p><p>Literature synthesised in the study of Annunziata &amp; Mariani shows that consumers' attitudes toward organic products are influenced by main attributes such as resource-saving, low-energy inputs, and the absence of chemicals; animal welfare, better conditions for farm workers, public health concerns; fair prices for producers, and support for small farms and rural communities <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Annunziata &amp; Mariani, 2018)</ref>. Consumers' attitudes regarding local food are influenced by the short distance between producers and consumers; better conditions for farm workers, building trust and social relationships in the local food system, strengthening local identity (via linking to the tradition and culture of a specific geographical area); job opportunities for local people, support small local producers, fair prices for farmers and producers <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Annunziata &amp; Mariani, 2018)</ref>. Consumers who do not believe in logos/labels of sustainable attributes of food products will not translate their positive attitudes into behavioural intentions <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Annunziata &amp; Scarpato, 2014)</ref>.</p><p>The study by Annunziata &amp; Scarpato in 2014 found that consumers who do not trust labels or sustainable claimed information of food products will not tend to translate their positive sustainable attitudes into a behavioural intention <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Annunziata &amp; Scarpato, 2014</ref>). People's beliefs about personal or social desirability also possibly influence behavioural intentions toward sustainable food products <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Vermeir &amp; Verbeke, 2008)</ref>. The empirical study of Vermeir &amp; Verbeke about food consumption of Belgium young adults shows that 50% of the sustainable dairy products consuming intention was explained by 4 factors: "personal attitudes, perceived social influences, perceived consumer effectiveness, and perceived availability" <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Vermeir &amp; Verbeke, 2008)</ref>. The more involved with and the more concerned about the potential impact of sustainable foods, the more intention to buy those foods <ref type="bibr">(Bisonette and</ref><ref type="bibr">Contento, 2001 cited in Vermeir &amp;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Verbeke, 2008)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>+ Perceived self-efficacy and perceived behavioural control</head><p>Perceived self-efficacy is the self-evaluation of one person regarding his/her ability to successfully execute an action in a particular situation <ref type="bibr">(Bandura, 1982</ref><ref type="bibr">cited in Fozouni Ardekani et al., 2021)</ref>. In the literature, perceived self-efficacy is proven to affect behavioural intention effectively and is used as a factor in many sustainable food consumption studies. For example, consumers' self-efficacy has been used in the model of Fozouni Ardekani et al. as the self-assessment of consumers about their capabilities to adopt genetically modified foods <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Fozouni Ardekani et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>Perceived behavioural control includes inner control (self-efficacy) and external perceived difficulty factor (perceived barriers) <ref type="bibr">(Sparks et al., 1997</ref><ref type="bibr">cited in Vermeir &amp; Verbeke, 2008)</ref>. An example of an external perceived difficulty factor is the perceived availability of products. <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Vermeir &amp; Verbeke (2008)</ref> defined perceived availability as consumers' thinking that they can easily obtain or consume a certain product. Therefore, low perceived availability will hamper the intention to buy sustainable products <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Vermeir &amp; Verbeke, 2008)</ref>. Another example of an externally perceived difficulty factor is consumers' eating habits and knowledge. Specifically, consumers who are unfamiliar with meat substitute food, lack cooking skills, and do not know the negative impact of meat on the environment, etc. are barriers to meat reduction in the diet <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Verain et al., 2015)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>+ Changing eating habits and food practices toward sustainability</head><p>Food consumption policies should further investigate eating habits to encourage consumers to shift to new sustainable food consumption patterns <ref type="bibr">(Scalvedi et al., 2018)</ref>. Eating meat is the habit of many consumers, especially male consumers. In their study, de Koning et al. quote one respondent: "Eating less meat is difficult to do in my family because my husband only eats meat", and so many Vietnamese men consider meat the main portion in their meals <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(de Koning et al., 2015)</ref>. Eating meat habits will make them more reluctant to eliminate/ reduce meat in their meals compared to shifting to consuming more sustainable types of meat <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Vanhonacker, van Loo, Gellynck, &amp; Verbeke, 2013</ref><ref type="bibr">cited in Verain et al., 2015)</ref>. Eating ready-to-eat meals has become increasingly popular, especially for those with busy lifestyles. Pucci et al. found that ready meals can save time and people who eat them think it is convenient and can spend time doing other things than cooking <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Pucci et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>Changing an individual's food preferences and habits is challenging <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Pucci et al., 2021)</ref>. Changes in the food practices of consumers are often linked to changes in their circumstances, for example, having children or moving to retirement <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Pucci et al., 2021)</ref>. In other words, the eating habits of one consumer can be affected by the eating habits of the people they live with. For example, one respondent in the study of O'Neill et al. confirmed that "her boyfriend was vegetarian and he had influenced her eating habits" <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(O'Neill et al., 2019)</ref>. It means the eating habits of each individual can affect the whole family's eating habits. O'Neill et al. found that consumers' food shopping behaviours, eating habits, and cooking practices can be impacted by changing circumstances of their daily life (such as getting married, having a new son/daughter, having a new full-time job, and moving to retirement), learning from other people, or being persuaded by public events/ campaigns <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(O'Neill et al., 2019)</ref>. "The rhythms of family life and an ethics of care in providing 'proper' food for one's family influence what is eaten" <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Pucci et al., 2021)</ref>. Relocation from urban to rural areas can also trigger changes in consumption practices <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Pucci et al., 2021)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>+ Barriers to sustainable food consumption</head><p>Although behavioural intentions control actual behaviours, not all intentions are translated into actual behaviours <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Ajzen, 1985)</ref>. Barriers toward sustainable food consumption can be classified into three groups: product-related barriers, consumer-related barriers, and food-market-related barriers. In the product-related barrier group, high price of sustainable products (organic products) is the most mentioned barrier in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Haider et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Lee &amp; Hwang, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Mäkiniemi &amp; Vainio, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Nguyen et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Terlau &amp; Hirsch, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Verain et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Vitterso &amp; Tangeland, 2015)</ref> but Lee &amp; Hwang found that high price is not a barrier for "heavy buyers" of organic food. Another barrier is the bad taste of sustainable products <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Mäkiniemi &amp; Vainio, 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Regarding the consumer-related barrier group, eating habit is one of the main barriers to sustainable food consumption. Consumers want to eat the same way as their habits <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Mäkiniemi &amp; Vainio, 2014)</ref>. They are unaware/disbelief of the environmental effects of food production <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Mäkiniemi &amp; Vainio, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Verain et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Vitterso &amp; Tangeland, 2015)</ref> or see no benefit from eating more sustainable and lack motivation to consume sustainable food <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Vitterso &amp; Tangeland, 2015)</ref>. Moreover, consumers also do not trust sustainable labels and certifications <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Annunziata &amp; Scarpato, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Mäkiniemi &amp; Vainio, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Terlau &amp; Hirsch, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Vitterso &amp; Tangeland, 2015)</ref>. Some consumers said that they lack cooking skills for plant-based products, therefore, have difficulties when moving to this kind of eating pattern <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Hielkema &amp; Lund, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Vanhonacker et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Vitterso &amp; Tangeland, 2015)</ref>. Busy lifestyle makes people "try to save time in the field of nutrition in order to gain time for their leisure-time activities" <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Pfeiffer et al., 2017)</ref>, therefore, they perceive time barriers: do not have time to prepare sustainable diet or to read and care information of sustainable labels in the food stores <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Mancini et al., 2017)</ref>. Another barrier in this group relates to "food neophobia" <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Hielkema &amp; Lund, 2021</ref>) -people's avoidance of eating new foods -which means difficult to transform into other eating patterns.</p><p>Finally, in the food-market-related barrier group, poor supply (difficulty in finding these products when shopping) is the most popular barrier <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Annunziata &amp; Scarpato, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Haider et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Mäkiniemi &amp; Vainio, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Terlau &amp; Hirsch, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Vitterso &amp; Tangeland, 2015)</ref>.

However, existing studies on sustainable food consumption topic are still quite fragmented, and most of them focus on single aspects of sustainable food consumption only <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Annunziata &amp; Mariani, 2018)</ref>; many empirical studies in the literature focus on the acquisition phase (purchasing food) only <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Annunziata &amp; Mariani, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Annunziata &amp; Scarpato, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Carfora et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Pucci et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Vecchio &amp; Annunziata, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">von Meyer-Höfer &amp; Spiller, 2013)</ref>. Consumption is seen as a phenomenon that comprises different phases, and the consumption process is commonly distinguished into three main phases: acquisition, usage, and disposal <ref type="bibr">(Geiger et al., 2018)</ref> <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> . It means that sustainable food consumption is not simply by purchasing (or intent to purchase) sustainable food products. What if local products -considered sustainable food -are bought by consumers but then consumed in unsustainable ways (for example, generating too much food waste, or using too much energy while cooking)? Therefore, when studying sustainable food consumption, researchers should analyse the whole process of food consumption to have a comprehensive and deeper view of the topic. However, as far as my knowledge goes, no study on the sustainable food consumption topic incorporates all three phases in their studies. To filling this gap in the literature, this research will build a framework covering all three phases of food consumption: acquisition phase (purchasing ingredients), usage phase (cooking, eating), and disposal phase (sharing leftover food, food waste).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Table 1: Strategy, inclusion, and exclusion criteria of the document search</head><p>At first, I used the broad search strategy: "sustainab* food consume*" OR "sustainab* agri* food consum*" OR "food consum* sustainab*" OR "agri* food consum* sustainab*" on Web of Science and Scopus databases to find relevant articles. A raw dataset of 699 documents published from 1999 to 2022 was found (356 documents from Web of Science; and 343 documents from Scopus. After setting inclusion and exclusion criteria (see Table <ref type="table">1</ref>), the total number of documents was reduced to 422 (284 documents via Web of Science and 138 documents via Scopus) and after deleting duplicate ones, the remaining were 335 documents (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). These 335 documents were further screened based on the titles and abstracts. We eliminated the documents that are not relevant to the food consumption topic, articles about ready-to-eat food (such as fast food, food in restaurants, etc.), articles about food policies of countries, and articles that do not have the English version. Finally, we selected 68 documents (most of them are empirical studies) to further read and synthesise in this article (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). To prepare for the backward search, I conducted a similar search strategy as in Table <ref type="table">1</ref> but set the inclusion criteria of "review article". There were 36 literature review articles found (17 from the Web of Science and 19 from Scopus). After deleting 12 duplicate ones, and then applying title and abstract screening, there were 8 literature review articles on sustainable food consumption topics left. These 8 literature review articles were selected for backward search by looking at their reference lists, comparing these lists with 68 selected documents (avoid duplicating), using Google Scholar to retrieve the documents, and then screening the targeted articles based on the titles and abstracts. From a backward search, I found 143 relevant articles and these documents were further screened based on the titles and abstracts. Finally, I selected 21 documents (most of them are empirical studies) to further read and synthesise in this article (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</p><p>Among 68 selected documents, I found the ones having high citations, then using Google Scholar, I applied citation search (forward search) on these high citation articles, setting date criteria from 2000 to 2023, and retrieving documents from the first 10 pages of Google Scholar, I found 110 relevant articles (after discarding the duplicated ones). Then these articles were further screened based on titles and abstracts. Finally, I selected 15 documents to further read and synthesise in this article (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</p><p>When screening the above articles, I realized that most of these articles focus on the acquisition phase of food consumption, some recent studies also focus on household food waste while only a few results regarding the usage phase of food consumption. In specific, most of these articles mainly studied sustainable food choices or purchasing behaviours, e.g., attitude toward sustainable products, the intention or actual purchasing organic food/ local food, fair trade products, etc. Another major trend of these studies is sustainable eating patterns, for example, reducing (red) meat consumption, moving toward a plant-based diet, substituting meat with hybrid meats, or vegetarian motivations, etc. This finding helps me understand why the current systematic literature review articles on the sustainable food consumption topic only focus on the acquisition phase.</p><p>As mentioned above, sustainable food consumption is not simply by purchasing (or intent to purchase) sustainable food products. What if a high percentage of organic and local products -considered sustainable food -are bought by consumers and then end up in a bin (food waste)? And what if the "sustainable" ingredients are cooked by an "unsustainable" method (e.g., waste too much energy when cooking)? We cannot simply conclude that the food consumption behaviour of one consumer is sustainable or unsustainable by just looking at their purchasing behaviour (or even their eating patterns). Instead, researchers and policymakers should apply a more comprehensive approach in their sustainable food consumption studies/policies.</p><p>To provide a more comprehensive reference on this topic, I conducted another search in Web of Science and Scopus database (do not set date constraints) to find more relevant documents in the usage phase. Usage of food at the household level can be divided into two phases: preparing/cooking food and storing food. Therefore, I set two following search strategies: (1) ("household cooking" OR "home cooking") AND (sustainabl*); (2) ("food storage") AND (home OR household) AND (sustainabl*). After deleting duplicate documents, and applying titles and abstracts screening, I found another 11 documents to further read in this literature review (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</p><p>I also used Google Scholar to search for more studies about food waste topics. Interestingly, most of the articles found when searching with the keywords "food waste" and "household" studied the whole process of food consumption: from planning what to buy, storing food at home, and cooking, to disposing, and food waste. After applying the title and abstract screening on these articles, I found 30 documents regarding household food waste to further analyse and synthesise in this article. Documents were searched and screened from September 2022 to February 2023. Finally, all 145 selected documents were selected to further read for this article.</p></div>

Co-cooking can help resolve the food waste issue generated by "cooking a lot at one time and then just reheat the food for the next meal" (of busy lifestyle women). Co-cooking also help household reduce food expenses <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Mansor et al., 2022)</ref> as well as the energy used in food storage and household cooking. These analyses implied the vital role of the sharing economy in transforming to more sustainable food consumption at home. However, as far as I know, while many studies are focusing on food sharing as a channel for sharing leftover food, there are still limited numbers of studies in the literature on study sharing economy (coprocurement, co-cooking) in the food consumption sector.</p></div>

Understanding family members' preferences, knowing how much each member of the family usually eats <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Hebrok &amp; Heidenstrøm, 2019)</ref>, what food they like, etc will help the "chef of the family" cook tasty dishes, and serve the right portion per meal, and therefore, reduce household food waste. As far as I know, there are limited studies in the literature investigating these factors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.4.">Storing food and household food waste</head><p>As mentioned above, some studies in the literature reveal that planned shopping with a shopping list can help reduce food waste. Examining the fridge &amp; pantry to check the food stocks before creating the shopping list is an important step to help avoid food waste. In their study, McCarthy &amp; Liu proved that a high percentage of food was put in the garbage bin because people forgot about food left in the fridge <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(McCarthy &amp; Liu, 2017)</ref>. However, consumers with busy lifestyles usually do not plan their food shopping and have no time to check the fridge &amp; pantry before shopping, therefore, they "are more likely to purchase foods that are already available at home" <ref type="bibr">(Ganglbauer et al., 2013</ref><ref type="bibr">cited in Nabi et al., 2021)</ref>. Households with women who have full-time employment, high education, high income, and less time to manage food at home are an example of this consumer segment <ref type="bibr">(Mohsenin and Mohajer, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr">Alibaigi, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr">Ahmadi Nadooshan, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr">and</ref><ref type="bibr">Shahnoushi et al., 2012 cited in Lin &amp;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Guan, 2021)</ref>.

While organic food consumers are expected to waste less food "to avoid the monetary loss associated with wasting quality food" <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(McCarthy &amp; Liu, 2017)</ref>, other studies show that healthy lifestyle consumers are afraid that leftover food harms their health, so they will not eat leftover food <ref type="bibr">(Savelli et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">van Geffen et al., 2020</ref><ref type="bibr">cited in Mansor et al., 2022)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.">A framework for future studies</head><p>Based on what is found from the thematic approach, following, I will propose a framework to evaluate the sustainable food consumption of households in future studies. The sustainable food consumption process in this framework (see Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>) will start from purchasing ingredients (acquisition phase) to cooking and eating (usage phase) and food waste (disposal phase) "to meet daily household food needs wisely and environmentally friendly". Storing behaviours play an important role in the whole process because good storing practices can help reduce food waste.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 4: A framework for sustainable food consumption studies</head><p>In the acquisition phase, we should start with the question: "Whether or not the households consume sustainable products?". These sustainable products can be organic, local products, seasonal food products, etc. Another question in this phase is: "Whether or not the households apply sustainable behaviours before and during purchasing food ingredients?". Sustainable behaviours before purchasing are meal planning and shopping planning with the shopping lists.; the sustainable behaviours during purchasing are avoiding bulk purchasing, avoiding "just in case" purchasing, etc.</p><p>The usage phase includes two stages: cooking and eating. In the cooking stage, we should take into consideration: "whether or not households apply sustainable practices in energy use for cooking?", such as the types of energy and the cooking appliances they use, the cooking methods they apply while cooking; whether are they trying to save energy while cooking; are they cook a lot at one time? Another question that can be asked in this stage is: "Are they good at cooking?". In other words, the frequency of burnt/ over-cooked food, cooked food that does not taste good, or wasting ingredients while cooking.</p><p>In the eating stage, we should ask: "Whether or not households adopt sustainable eating patterns?". Sustainable eating patterns can be curtailing the quantity of food in portions, reducing (red) meat consumption, or substituting meat with hybrid meat or pulse-based protein. Another question in this stage is: "whether or not households apply sustainable practices in the eating stage?" Specifically, do they eat leftover food, share or eat sharing food, etc.?</p><p>Finally, the disposal phase will be illustrated by the food waste issues (how much food is wasted? what kind of ingredients are wasted? As mentioned above, good storage practices can help reduce food waste. Literature shows that bulk purchasing (especially without planning) will contribute hugely to household food waste. However, if bulk-purchasing households preliminary process the ingredients after purchasing and store them properly (for example storing them in glass/plastic containers in the fridge properly), they can avoid food waste generated from their bulk purchase behaviours. Similarly with cooking a lot at one time and treating leftover food, the role of food storing is very important in reducing food waste.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Implications</head><p>Transforming towards a more sustainable food consumption is considered as an important solution to tackle the rapid increase in food demand and mitigate climate change effects on the food system. Therefore, in the future, I predict that more and more studies regarding these topics will be conducted all over the world.</p><p>To encourage the transition to sustainable food consumption of households, policymakers not only should focus on promoting sustainable food product consumption (such as organic food, local food, etc.) but also should take into consideration all stages of food consumption with a final target on reducing greenhouse gas emission of the food consumption process and minimising food waste of households. By referencing the proposed framework in this article, policymakers can build the annual "household food consumption sustainability index" for their countries. They can design the indicators to evaluate the current levels of sustainability in each phase of the food consumption process. By observing these annual household food consumption sustainability indexes (subindexes, and indicators), they can have more detailed views of the comprehensive picture, and therefore, can design effective campaigns/ policies to promote sustainable food consumption practices among consumers.</p><p>This framework can also contribute to the academic world by driving future studies in sustainable food consumption topics from mainly focusing on purchasing behaviours and sustainable eating patterns to a more comprehensive approach that covers all phases of food consumption with an emphasis on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and minimising food waste of households. Based on the research interests, future researchers in the field can investigate any phase, or smaller stage(s) in each phase of the consumption progress. However, if a researcher is interested in "sustainable food consumption" in general, he/she should incorporate all three phases in his/her study with a focus on food waste generated from this process of food consumption.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusions</head><p>Inputs of this article mainly come from the Web of Science and Scopus databases and some documents collected Google Scholar search engine, therefore, it is inevitable to miss the relevant documents in the literature. Food consumption includes home cooking, eating out, eating ready-to-eat food/ processed food products, etc. To simplify the content of sustainable food consumption so that can build an easy-to-apply framework for future practitioners (especially policymakers in developing countries), this research only focuses on the sustainable home cooking process of households. This is another limitation of this research.</p><p>Food sustains human life, but household food consumption impacts heavily on the environment. To ensure food security and healthy diets for future generations, it is more necessary than ever to transform food systems toward sustainability. Sustainable food consumption is not simply by purchasing sustainable food products. However, a majority of studies in the literature focus on the acquisition phase of food consumption only. In the future, to design policies promoting sustainable food consumption of households, policymakers should investigate the whole food consumption process from acquiring, using, and disposing of food to meet daily household food needs wisely and environmentally friendly.</p><p>By covering all phases of food consumption, this research has built a comprehensive framework for future studies on sustainable food consumption topics. Policymakers can easily use this framework to build indicators that support designing effective pro-sustainability campaigns/policies in the food consumption sector. Researchers can reference this framework to conduct more comprehensive studies on sustainable food consumption topics in the future.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Search strategy to find inputs for the article Since I only searched documents in the Web of Science and Scopus databases, it is inevitable to miss the relevant documents in the literature but not in these two databases.
