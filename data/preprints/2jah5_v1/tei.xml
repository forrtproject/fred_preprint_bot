<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>The plasmonic properties of metal nanoparticles with a high density of free electrons, Me-PNP (Au, Ag, Cu, etc.), are of great interest in terms of increasing the efficiency of solar cells, photoelectrocatalytic hydrogen generators, and biosensors <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. However, the catalytic activity of typical plasmonic metals (Au, Ag, Cu, Al) for H2 production is comparatively low <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</p><p>Therefore, hybrid plasmonic nanostructures are created in which the plasmonic properties of Me-PNP are combined with additional improved catalytic properties of non-plasmonic metal catalysts (Pt, Ru, Rh, Ni), which in many cases are not present in single-component analogs. The hybrid plasmonic system exhibits increased catalytic activity due to a combination of efficient absorption of light by plasmonic nanoparticles and the transfer of concentrated energy to the charge carriers of the catalyst. In such systems, the decay of plasmonic resonances changes in favor of non-radiative heat generation, compared to radiative processes (scattering) <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</p><p>Moreover, hybrid plasmonic structures exhibit increased chemical stability due to the formation of stable chemical bonds between the boundary atoms of the interface. Thus, enhanced light absorption due to the local field of Me-PNP and the increased injection rate of hot carriers from the plasmonics to the catalytic metal improves H2 production.</p><p>Enhanced light absorption by the interface and a corresponding shift in the spatial distribution of absorption toward the catalytic metal increases the lifetime of excited catalyst carriers, thereby increasing the efficiency of H2 and O2 evolution reactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</p><p>Thus, the catalytic activity of plasmonic metals can be improved by combining plasmonic metals with conventional catalytically active metals, the inclusion of which can help reduce the activation energy of a reaction step or improve the dynamics of hydrogen generation on the catalyst surface. Combining the two metals reduces the chemical potential of charge carrier transfer across the interface and increases the efficiency of H2 and O2 gas separation reactions and their recovery <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. The plasmonic properties of Ni-PNP nickel nanoparticles are weaker than those of plasmonic metals (Ag, Cu, Al) <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, as Ni-PNP exhibit stronger plasmon damping due to strong magnetic polarization <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, but they are less demanding to manufacture. The main advantage of Ni is its good catalytic properties in the hydrogen evolution reaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> and low cost.</p><p>To this end, we investigated the possibility of using Ni-NP nickel nanoparticles <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> to create a Ni-PNP/PS nickel plasmonic structure based on porous silicon (PS) as a supporting semiconductor core <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. As is known <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, porous silicon nanocrystallites (nc-PS) are excellent catalysts for H2 evolution in water photoelectrolysis reactions.</p><p>PS with a periodically changing surface structure and possessing the properties of a diffraction grating <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> is attractive for the creation of a periodic structure due to its high porosity and the potential possibility of obtaining a plasmonic structure using a relatively simple electrochemical method of etching and deposition of a plasmonic-active metal -metal-stimulated etching <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. In addition, nickel silicide NiSi, formed on the surface of PS (at the Ni-PNP/nc-PS interface), exhibits protective properties against corrosion in a wide range of pH 5-pH 11 <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</p><p>Porous silicon, consisting of an ensemble of oxidized wide-bandgap (Eg = 1.8 -2.9 eV) silicon nanocrystallites (nc-Si), occupies a special place in silicon technology, which still remains dominant in the electronics industry <ref type="bibr">[14]</ref>. The high energy of porous silicon nanocrystallites nc-Si/PS <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[15]</ref> determines the high catalytic activity of PS, which is twice as high as the catalytic activity of the Pt electrode in the hydrogen evolution reaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[16]</ref>.</p><p>Porous silicon PS, containing nanoparticles of plasmonic metals Me-PNP, is, in essence, plasmonic nanostructures Me-PNP/PS, localizing the scattering and absorption of light near The free-electron oscillation frequencies of Me-PNPs are sources of localized plasmonic resonance radiation. The porous PS structure is used as a supporting framework for plasmonic PNP nanoparticles. By controlling the morphology, shape, and size of the pores, as well as the conductivity type of the silicon framework in the form of p-type silicon for the photocathode, the PS structure can be tailored for efficient photocatalysis of a specific hydrogen evolution reaction at the cathode, making them promising systems for achieving high hydrogen production selectivity. The developed PS surface allows for the concentration of plasmon-activated catalytic centers on the electrode surface near the region of plasmon resonance enhancement, increasing the efficiency of the H2 evolution reaction in the pores near the plasmonic Me-PNPs. Furthermore, during the formation of the Ni-PNP/PS nickel plasmonic nanostructure, chemically stable silicide coatings form on the pore surface, increasing the stability of such structures in H2 evolution reactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[16]</ref>.</p><p>The main drawback of plasmonic structures based on Me-PNP/PS porous silicon is the lack of periodicity in the arrangement of pores or nanocrystallites of porous silicon, nc-Si/PS. We have demonstrated the feasibility of creating a strictly periodic Ni-PNP/PS nickel plasmonic structure by masking the surface of a c-Si single crystal using optical lithography and subsequent pore formation in a single-step metal-assisted electrochemical etching process. This paper presents the results of the fabrication of uniform periodic plasmonic Me-PNPs/por-Si structures by masking the wafer surface using optical lithography, and followed by the formation of pores and the deposition of plasmonic-active metal nanoparticles (Me-PNPs) in a single-step metal-assisted electrochemical etching (MACE) process. The photoluminescence properties of the nickel plasmonic Ni-PNP/PS structure formed on the basis of the Ni+ ion-implanted textured surface (SiO2/c-Si) of silicon wafers by the deposition of nickel nanoparticle (Ni-NPs) in a single-step process of the formation of the periodic porous silicon (PS) structure and the deposition of Ni-NP nanoparticles by the combined EMACE method-a combination of electrochemical (EC) and MACE of single-crystal silicon c-Si-are also investigated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental Procedure</head><p>In this work, we used p-Si (100) single crystal wafers, 10 ohm cm, with a diameter of 100 mm and a thickness 500 mkm of grown by the Czochralski method. The samples were preliminarily thermally oxidized at 1000 °C in an oxygen atmosphere for 100 min to form a 500 nm thick layer of thermal silicon oxide (SiO 2 therm .) on the surface. A checkerboard texture with alternating areas 100 × 100 μm2 of thermal SiO2 and crystalline c-Si (SiO 2 therm. /c-Si) was created on the oxidized silicon surface by using optical lithography for masking and opening the oxide layer, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. The SiO2 layer was used as a protective window during etching of pores in c-Si and as an optical window of the silicon photoelectrode, transparent to sunlight, during photoelectrolysis of water <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. To form an ohmic contact, a 300 nm thick aluminum layer was deposited on the back side of the wafer using magnetron sputtering, and followed by annealing at 400 °C for 30 min under a vacuum of 5 ⋅ 10 -5 Torr.   It is evident that uniform pores of virtually identical sizes form in the exposed areas of crystalline c-Si silicon; the pore diameters are commensurate with their depth (Fig. <ref type="figure">4d</ref>). This is achieved due to the action of long-range elastic-deformational stress forces arising at the c-Si/SiO2 interface due to differences in their structures <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[15]</ref>, which causes the formation of uniform pores in the near-boundary region. As these forces weaken, non-uniform pores form,  Thus, creating alternating c-Si/SiO 2 interface boundaries by pre-masking the silicon wafer surface using optical lithography allows for the formation of uniform pores. This will overcome the main drawback of porous silicon for formation of the Me-PNP/PS plasmonic nanostructurethe lack of periodicity in the arrangement of pores or nanocrystallites of porous silicon, nc-Si/PS and to create of periodic plasmonic structures on porous silicon by depositing plasmonic metal nanoparticles on them.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results and Discussion</head><p>On the SEM-image of the nickel plasmonic structure Ni-PNP/PS clearly shows nickelcontaining areas and areas of pure porous silicon without nickel, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7a</ref>. Area 001 does not contain Ni lines in the EDS (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7b</ref>) and corresponds to purely porous silicon PS, and the EDspectrum of area 002 shows the presence of Ni peaks (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7c</ref>), which indicates porous silicon with nickel content, PS&lt;Ni&gt;. This is also confirmed by brightness of the SEM images of region 002, which is bright, than the region 001, because the intensity of secondary reflected electrons increases with increasing average atomic number <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[17]</ref>; it is higher for Ni (59) than for I (28).</p><p>Therefore, region 002, containing PS&lt;Ni&gt;, has a higher brightness than the pure PS layer without Ni, region 001. It should be especially noted that in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6a</ref>, in region 002, a rectangular region is clearly observed, which appeared due to the silicide layer formed during thermal annealing of the contacts at 400 •C. The X-ray spectrum of this sample (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7</ref>) shows the presence of NiSi lines, characteristic of nickel silicides <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[16]</ref>.</p><p>0.00 1.00 2.00 3.00 4.00 5.00 6.00 7.00 8.00 9.00 10.00 This silicide layer is characterized by high chemical stability <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[16]</ref>.  When illuminated with a red LED, the porous region exhibits a brighter luminescence (Fig. <ref type="figure">9a</ref>) than the unetched region (Fig. <ref type="figure">9b</ref>). The reflectance spectra of these samples show that the reflection of light with an intensity of … in the wavelength range of 200 -1100 nm for the matte surface of the original silicon substrate is at the level of 70%, for porous silicon from 10% to 50% depending on the porosity, and for the plasmonic structure 2-3% in the UV region, 5-7% in the visible region (400 -700) nm and up to 15% for long wavelengths &gt; 800 nm.</p><p>That is, the reflectance spectra indicate that the luminosity is due not to the reflectivity of the surface of the samples, but to the radiative properties of the plasmonic structure of Ni-PNP/por-Si.</p><p>As is known <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[18]</ref>, the nature of the enhancement of the optical signal of photoluminescence and Raman scattering of light by plasmonic structures is due to the resonant excitation of plasmons, Free electron vibrations in metal nanoparticles, the intensity of which depends on the morphology of the nanostructures, the electron density of the plasmonic nanoparticles, and the dielectric environment. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">11</ref> shows the Raman spectra for crystalline (c-Si) and porous silicon with and without nickel, prepared by different methods. The highest intensity of the Raman peak Ipor-Si(EMACE) = 54,000 rel. units is observed for the por-Si(EMACE) sample at a Raman shift frequency of ˅ = 520.32 cm-1, formed by the combined method (MACE + EC). The high intensity of the Raman peak indicates a higher pore density and an increase in the concentration of scattering centers <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[19]</ref>.</p><p>The Raman spectra also show that samples with higher porosity have a higher Raman peak intensity at a high frequency shift, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5a</ref>. The highest Raman peak intensity Iν = 54,000 counts at a frequency of 520.32 cm-1 is observed for the sample fabricated by the EMACE method. For the MACE sample, the intensity and frequency values are 33,000 counts and 519.66 cm-1, respectively. The sample fabricated by the EC method exhibits values of 17,000 counts at 519.11 cm-1. The Raman peak intensity for c-Si is 2,000, and the corresponding frequency is 519.11 cm-1. The Raman spectra of c-Si and PS exhibit a characteristic resonance peak due to electron-phonon scattering, the intensity and frequency of which depend on the concentration of scattering centers and, consequently, on the pore formation conditions. The high-frequency shift and the decrease in the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the main peak due to the increase in the peak intensity are most significant in the sample fabricated by EMACE. This phenomenon is attributed to the increase in the number of Raman centers in nanocrystalline silicon <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[18]</ref>. Since the samples fabricated by EC and EMACE exhibit similar levels of porosity (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">11</ref>), the enhancement of the Raman signal cannot be attributed solely to the increase in porosity. Even a small amount of metal content can be crucial in enhancing the Raman peak intensity. Note that the Raman spectra for all samples show no Ni-related nanoscale features at 550 cm-1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[20]</ref>. A possible additional source of Raman peak enhancement is the doping of substitutional (NiSi) and interstitial (NiI) nickel atoms incorporated into the silicon matrix. Since the high rate of nickel absorption into silicon has been previously documented in numerous experiments <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[21]</ref>, we simulated substitutional (NiSi) and interstitial (NiI) defects <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[22]</ref>.</p><p>The simulation details are the same as in our recent work <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[23]</ref>. As shown in Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">12a</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">12b</ref>, the electronic structure of the substitutional nickel impurity exhibits the same peak at the Fermi level as silver (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">12c</ref>). Since silver nanostructures exhibit Raman peak enhancement, we can attribute the increase in Raman peak intensity in the EMACE-prepared sample to changes similar to those of silver in the local electronic structures of the Ni-doped silicon matrix. To verify the possibility of carbon nucleation, described for cz-Si <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[24]</ref>, and the formation of some ordered carbon structures, Raman spectra were obtained in the range from 1000 to 2000 cm-1 in the sample with the highest carbon content (EMACE). The results of the measurements demonstrate the presence of some carbon-carbon bonds in the spectra (see inset in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">11a</ref>) without the distinct D and G peaks typical of layered carbon structures <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[25]</ref>. Based on the low Raman signal from these carbon structures and the absence of peaks corresponding to an ordered carbon structure, we can conclude that these carbon structures do not affect the enhancement of the Raman signal.</p><p>Moreover, the Raman peak intensity of the sample prepared by EMACE is almost twice that of the samples prepared by EC (33,000 counts versus 17,000 counts) <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[19]</ref>.</p><p>Thus, preliminary masking of the silicon wafer surface allows for the formation of uniform pores. This avoids the main drawback of porous silicon as the backbone of the Me-PNP/PS plasmonic nanostructure-the lack of periodicity in the arrangement of pores or nanocrystallites of porous silicon, nc-Si/PS.</p><p>This allows the creation of periodic plasmonic Ni-PNP/PS structures using single-step EMACE etching, which involves masking the surface of a single-crystal silicon with a photomask and then forming pores by etching c-Si.</p></div>
