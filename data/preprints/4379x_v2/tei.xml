<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Resilience and Drinking Behaviors in Emerging Adults with Previous Extracurricular Participation</head><p>Few contemporary high school archetypes have entered the cultural consciousness quite like the "model student." As prestigious universities faced thousands more qualified applicants than available seats, admission committees used extracurricular involvement to predict future success. In response, student extracurricular participation grew at record rates <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Mayol-García, 2022)</ref>. However, data analysis of over six million college applications revealed that historically privileged demographics: White, high socioeconomics, and private school educated reported significantly more extracurricular participation, leadership positions, and awards <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Park et al., 2023)</ref>.</p><p>Nevertheless, viewing extracurricular participation solely to impress college admissions would be reductive. The admissions shift toward valuing these activities emerged due to their long-documented association with positive developmental outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Agans et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Busseri et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Forneris et al., 2015)</ref>. It has been well-established that extracurricular participation is an impactful part of American students' development as it has repeatedly been linked to school success and decreased behavioral issues <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Martin et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Weitzman &amp; Chen, 2005)</ref>. Notably, extracurricular participation has been demonstrated as particularly developmentally beneficial for youths exposed to adverse events <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Mahoney &amp; Cairns, 1997)</ref>. While highly influential during adolescence, the long-term impact of extracurricular participation has yet to be thoroughly explored. There remain unanswered questions regarding the durability of these effects and whether such participation contributes to enduring behavioral patterns into emerging adulthood.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Emerging Adulthood</head><p>Emerging adulthood, ages 18-25, was conceptualized to describe shifting timelines for major life milestones across generations <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Arnett, 2014)</ref>. Though legally adults, individuals in this age range are typically in the early stages of establishing their adult independence. In the past, it was common to marry and have children during the mid-twenties; however today the average marriage age is 30 for US men and 28 for US women (U.S. Census <ref type="bibr">Bureau, 2023)</ref>. Despite the shift, typical US adults still leave their parents' homes between the ages of 18-19 and do not enter the workforce until their late twenties <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Arnett, 2014)</ref>. This delayed transition has created an extended developmental period characterized by increased autonomy, identity exploration, and self-focus. Across 300 interviews, Dr. Jeffery Arnett conceptualized emerging adulthood by classifying five typical developmental experiences: identity exploration, instability, self-focus, feeling "in-between", and optimism <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Arnett, 2014)</ref>. While an exciting time, this period is also associated with increased substance use. A 45 year-long longitudinal study found that substance use peaked during this time across generations <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Schulenberg et al., 2020)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Binge Drinking</head><p>Binge drinking has remained a common occurrence among emerging adults as supported by a nationally representative study of more than 50,000 college students. About two in five students reported drinking at binge levels at least once every two weeks <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Wechsler &amp; Kuo, 2000)</ref>. Intoxication has also been frequently found among young adults as 48% of college student drinkers reported that reaching drunkenness was their main motivation for drinking, 23% drank more than ten times a month, and 29% became intoxicated more than 3 times a month <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Wechsler &amp; Nelson, 2008)</ref>. Moreover, a clear association between binge drinking and frequent drinking has been established in this age range. In a survey of American college students, 64% of drinkers met criteria for both binge drinking and weekly drinking. Only 19% of drinkers qualified as binge drinkers alone and 17% were weekly drinkers only <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(DeMartini &amp; Carey, 2012)</ref>. Frequent binge drinking in emerging adulthood has been linked to neural structural changes, academic decline, increased criminal behavior, and future substance use disorder <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Pérez-García et al., 2022)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Adverse Childhood Experiences</head><p>In 1998, <ref type="bibr">Felitti et al. sought</ref> to determine if events in childhood correlated with later health complications. After analyzing health data from nearly 10,000 adults, the research team identified ten traumatic childhood experiences that had a significant dose-response relationship with later serious health complications. Over 50% of respondents reported one or more Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs), while around 25% reported two or more ACEs. People who reported four or more ACEs were 4-12 times more at risk for substance use disorder, depression, and suicide; 2-4 times more at risk for smoking, sexually transmitted diseases, and poor health; and 1.4-1.6 times more at risk for obesity <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Felitti et al., 1998)</ref>. This study marked the first empirical linkage between childhood experience and later health outcomes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Challenges Linked to ACEs</head><p>Since the original publication, studies across healthcare, education, and social science disciplines have used Adverse Childhood Experiences to quantify childhood adversity. ACEs have consistently correlated with negative physical, mental, and interpersonal consequences if left without intervention <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Howell et al., 2021</ref>). An analysis of over 1000 children in the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study found that 55% of the children were exposed to at least one ACE and 12% experienced more than three <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Jimenez et al., 2016)</ref>. Generational ACE impact literature from <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Howell et al. (2021)</ref> suggested that ACEs limit skills acquisition opportunities and lead to self-blame or externalizing behaviors. ACE exposure was found to correlate with lower social emotional learning capabilities, low affection parent-child relationships, and more frequent behavioral and emotional problems during childhood <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Howell et al., 2021)</ref>. A 2024 meta-analysis found that ACE-exposed young adults reported significantly more psychosocial problems than their peers <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Silva et al., 2024)</ref>. These internal struggles have been shown to externalize as risk taking behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Felitti et al., 1998)</ref>. Adults with higher ACE exposure displayed significantly decreased emotional regulation and self-regulation abilities which have been linked to poor decision making <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Silva et al., 2024)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Positive Youth Development</head><p>After the ACE study solidified that health consequences can originate from disrupted childhood development, researchers sought ways to protect the process. Educators soon recognized the significant amount of time children spend in school, and research began emphasizing childhood development enhancements through school-based programming. This initiated the Positive Youth Development (PYD) movement which holds the position that all children hold innate strengths that can be intentionally developed <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Martin et al., 2013)</ref>. The goal of PYD is not to eliminate challenges but instead introduce age-appropriate challenges that allow youths to practice positive personal agency <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Romer &amp; Hansen, 2021)</ref>. The leading model of PYD, known as the five characteristics or "5 C's," describes five core traits needed to facilitate holistic youth development. These C's are connection, competence, character, caring, and confidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Lerner, 2004)</ref>. Collectively, these traits have helped youths foster relationships, hone cognitive and motor skills, solidify moral judgment, display empathy, and build self-esteem. One longitudinal study demonstrated that these five traits helped youths successfully navigate challenges which in turn promoted well-rounded development <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bowers et al., 2010)</ref>. Furthermore, research found that individual positive development most effectively occurred when expressing these characteristics through community interactions, making prosocial approaches crucial for development <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Romer &amp; Hansen, 2021)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Extracurricular Participation</head><p>For school aged children, extracurricular activities are any regularly occurring, planned activities that occur outside of required academics. Although not required, extracurricular participation has become a staple of the American education system. As of 2015, over 80% of 7-12 graders participated in at least one organized extracurricular activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Grover et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>The most popular include athletics, arts, special interest clubs, and service-based organizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Grover et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Researchers have identified seven factors of extracurricular activities that contribute to beneficial adolescent development. These factors include physical and psychological safety, supportive interpersonal relationships, regular structure, opportunities for social belongingness, skill building challenges, self-efficacy discovery, and collaboration between school, family, and community <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Gardner et al., 2012)</ref>. Given the theoretical similarities between these factors and PYD's 5 C's, increasing extracurricular participation has become a core Positive Youth Development intervention.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Benefits Linked to Extracurricular Participation</head><p>Research has sought to validate PYD's approach by quantifying participation benefits.</p><p>One longitudinal study collected 5 C's, behavioral, and extracurricular data from 927 students during middle and high school. Students who consistently participated in extracurricular activities scored significantly higher on all five characteristics, particularly competence and connection. However, the findings on participation and behavioral decisions were mixed. More involved students did not report significantly less substance use but did refrain from risky behaviors more often than less involved peers <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Agans et al., 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Academically, activity outside of the classroom has positively correlated with performance inside the classroom. In a study of 643 students spanning from elementary school through high school, extracurricular participation correlated positively with class participation rates, adaptive motivation, meaningful class engagement, and academic satisfaction after controlling for socioeconomic status <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Martin et al., 2013)</ref>. Furthermore, extracurricular participation has also been found to encourage school completion. In another longitudinal study following 392 students from 7 th grade until 12 th grade, at-risk students who participated in extracurricular activities dropped out of school significantly less than at-risk peers who did not participate <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Mahoney &amp; Cairns, 1997)</ref>. A more recent study of 545 students had similar results.</p><p>Students who regularly participated in extracurriculars had significantly less risk of dropout, but those who attended activities infrequently had similar dropout rates to students who did not participate at all <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Thouin et al., 2022)</ref>. Crucially the threshold for this protective factor was attainable for most students as students only had to participate in one activity for at least two hours weekly to significantly decrease dropout risk <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Thouin et al., 2022)</ref>.</p><p>Importantly, environments that included adult mentors who engaged with the participants were found to facilitate social-emotional learning more effectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Almeida et al., 2023)</ref>.</p><p>Mentors provide leadership to extracurriculars, often being the person to define an activity's culture. A mentor's positive or negative dynamic with participants has been shown to be one of the determining factors in youths' decision to continue participation <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Dworkin, 2007)</ref>. Even within participating samples, youths who had strong mentorship bonds with teachers had significantly higher academic achievement and lower disciplinary action compared to youths without bonds <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Crosnoe et al., 2004)</ref>. Likewise, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Choi et al. (2015)</ref> found that the most successful mentors built authentic rapport with their participants which engendered mutual trust. With this bond, mentors integrated prosocial lessons such as good sportsmanship and conscientiousness into their coaching. Participants and their parents endorsed increased participant confidence, competence, and life skills that translated on and off the field <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Choi et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>From a PYD perspective, it is hypothesized that these behavioral benefits are facilitated through the self-regulation skills developed during extracurricular participation. Self-regulation is one's ability to mediate internal states despite external stimuli. This homeostatic responsibility extends across psychobiological processes including controlling circadian rhythms, behavioral reactivity, and goal-directed action <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Gestsdottir &amp; Lerner, 2007)</ref>. Proponents of PYD suggest that extracurricular activities allow self-regulation skills to develop through providing a safe environment for youth to experiment with self-directed behavior and appropriate adaptive coping to activity-based challenges. It is believed that this process is behaviorally reinforcing as positive adaptive self-regulation is rewarded through successful goal completion <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Gestsdottir &amp; Lerner, 2007)</ref>. Participants echoed this sentiment reporting more ease building relationships, collaborating with people of diverse backgrounds, and resisting peer pressure <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Forneris et al., 2015)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">A Gestsdottir and Lerner (2007)</ref> study of over 1,000 extracurricular participating youths found self-regulation scores positively correlated with the 5 C's of PYD and negatively correlated with known risk behaviors. A follow up analysis of 2,357 high schoolers indicated that self-regulation ability once again correlated with PYD signifiers and negatively predicted substance use, depression symptoms, and problem behaviors in youth <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Gestsdottir et al., 2010)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Challenges from Extracurricular Participation</head><p>While research has shown extracurricular activities offer adolescents benefits across academics and personality development, participation may also have social consequences.</p><p>Bullying within peer groups and unsupportive adult leaders were the leading causes of dissatisfaction. Youths reported quitting extracurriculars as a result and thus lost access to the possible developmental opportunities <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Dworkin, 2007)</ref>. Additionally, some extracurriculars may expose participants to performance pressures and associated mental health risks. US youth who played team sports displayed significantly lower conduct problems, anxiety symptoms, depression symptoms, peer conflict, and concentration issues than youths who did not participate. However, youths who played individual sports showed significantly greater anxiety and depression scores, social withdrawal, and attention issues <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Hoffmann et al., 2022)</ref>. Another study found sports participation as a whole was not associated with internalizing symptoms however increased frequency and perceived incompetency were positively associated with internalizing symptoms amongst athletes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Carter et al., 2023)</ref>. Finally, extracurricular participation may reinforce socioeconomic advantages. In a study of music and athletic-based extracurriculars, it was found that youths from families with higher education levels experienced greater cognitive benefits than peers who came from less educated families <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bering &amp; Schulz, 2024)</ref>. While research has shown that extracurricular participation particularly enhances development for participants with higher ACE exposure, socioeconomic status may prevent children from fully committing to activity participation <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Gardner et al., 2012)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Resilience</head><p>Resilience is a non-fixed trait that allows a person to adapt, overcome, and thrive after facing adversity <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Connor &amp; Davidson, 2003)</ref>. Self-efficacy often precedes resilience as selfefficacy's goal-directed decision-making abilities are essential for resilience <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Hamill, 2003)</ref>.</p><p>Beyond its definition as a personality trait, resilience has also been hypothesized to be a measure of an individual's ability to successfully cope in high stress situations. Unmanaged chronic stress can lead to negative health implications and lower quality of life <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Felitti et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Felix et al., 2019)</ref>. Resilience may be crucial to overcoming adversity without gaining increased risk for poor life outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Campbell-Sills et al., 2006)</ref>. A representative undergraduate sample had their coping styles, personality traits, and resilience assessed. Coping styles were split between task-oriented and emotion-oriented coping. While both types of coping correlated with resilience, task-oriented coping correlated more significantly <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Campbell-Sills et al., 2006)</ref>. Moreover, through the creation of the Connor Davidson Resilience scale (CD RISC), it was found that resilience was strongly negatively associated with stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Connor &amp; Davidson, 2003)</ref>. These findings further endorse resilience's active role in coping.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Resilience in Context of ACE-Exposed Individuals</head><p>As ACE exposure positions people in high stress environments, it is necessary for individuals to effectively cope. However, research has shown that resilience was less likely to naturally develop in individuals with ACE exposure <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Howell et al., 2021)</ref>. Longitudinal studies assessing ACE exposure and life outcomes found that ACE exposure significantly negatively correlated with both resilience and posttraumatic growth in adulthood. Moreover, these deficits were greater in individuals who were exposed to ACEs at younger ages <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Howell et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>Evidence has suggested resilience is a key factor against the negative developmental consequences of ACE exposure. In studies particularly addressing ACE-exposed youth, resilience significantly correlated with decreased stress symptoms and predicted age-appropriate development. These were meaningful findings as that same study found that ACE-exposed youth reported significantly greater trauma symptoms and qualified for a PTSD diagnosis more frequently than non-exposed youths <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bethell et al., 2014)</ref>. This protective factor has been observed in emerging adulthood. <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Schaefer et al. (2018)</ref> found resilience correlated with prosocial attitudes in ACE-exposed people as they transitioned to college. These emerging adults with greater resilience also reported higher optimism, posttraumatic growth, and improved familial bonds.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Drinking Behaviors Related to Resilience</head><p>Trauma exposure studies have explored resilience as a protective factor against substance use. For three years, 1,810 adolescents were surveyed annually about substance use, family risk factors, and adverse events. Regardless of the number of adverse effects faced, those who reported higher resilience also reported significantly less substance use <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Wills et al., 2001)</ref>.</p><p>Likewise, a buffering effect was found between resilience and alcohol use in the aftermath of trauma. Over 6,000 students were surveyed throughout their college years on alcohol use, alcohol use disorder symptoms, resilience, and newly occurring traumatic experiences. Those who reported a newly occurring traumatic experience also reported significantly more alcohol use and alcohol dependence. However, for those who reported higher amounts of resilience, increased alcohol use reported after new trauma was significantly reduced <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Cusack et al., 2023)</ref>.</p><p>These findings suggest that resilience may decrease the stress induced motivations that increase drinking behaviors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Current Study</head><p>While PYD research has frequently studied current adolescent extracurricular participants, there is limited research into the duration of developmental impacts. Particularly there is interest in whether these attitudes and behaviors developed during high school last through the highly transformative period of emerging adulthood. Self-efficacy and selfregulation have been identified as general contributors to lifelong well-being and their development has been directly linked to extracurricular participation <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Agans et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Forneris et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Gestsdottir &amp; Lerner, 2007)</ref>. Across psychology and education research, self-efficacy and resilience have been repeatedly found to have a strong positive correlation in high school students and emerging adults, with some results suggesting these traits may strengthen each other <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Hamill, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Konaszewski et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Qamar &amp; Akhter, 2020)</ref>.</p><p>The Positive Youth Development theoretical framework assumes that personality and behavioral patterns developed during adolescence have lasting impact into adulthood. While the current study aims to add to the literature in this regard, other studies have previously provided findings to support this trajectory. <ref type="bibr">Haider and van Stumm (2022)</ref> found emerging personality traits like conscientiousness recorded during adolescence correlated with greater academic attainment and performance in emerging adulthood. When compared to intelligence and socioeconomic status, personality traits during adolescence were found to be the strongest and most consistent predictors of adult life outcomes. Furthermore, a 12-year longitudinal study recorded adolescents' personality trait development and educational careers path yearly. It was found that those who developed greater amounts of emotional stability, conscientiousness, and extraversion reported significantly greater income, job, and career satisfaction during adulthood <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Hoff et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>Only a single study, by <ref type="bibr">Gardener et al. (2008)</ref>, has examined how previous extracurricular activity in high school affected life outcomes in emerging adults. This study limited its focus to educational and occupational attainment. The project evaluated data from the National Education Longitudinal Study, which consisted of a nationally representative sample of 24,599 8th graders surveyed again in 10th grade, 12th grade, and eight years after high school graduation. It was found that students who participated in school sponsored extracurricular activities during high school reported significantly higher grades and college attendance even after accounting for previous grades and confounding socioeconomic variables. Intensity of participation mattered as well. For every year of extracurricular participation in high school, the odds of being employed full time after graduation increased by 8% and those who participated for at least two years during high school had a 54% greater chance of attending college. Overall, students who participated more frequently in extracurricular activities attained greater educational and occupational outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Gardner et al., 2008)</ref>.</p><p>The current study aims to build upon the previous literature by examining both the attitudes and behaviors of those who participated in previous extracurricular activity as they enter adulthood. Notably, this study investigates the duration and specific behavioral manifestations of the developmental benefits that have been previously associated with involvement, both of which are unexplored within Positive Youth Development literature.</p><p>Additional examination of extracurricular participation and positive youth development impact will be evaluated in context of childhood adversity. It is hypothesized that resilience, educational attainment, and less frequent binge drinking in emerging adulthood will positively correlate with the amount of previous extracurricular participation. Moreover, it is expected that ACEs will positively correlate with more frequent binge drinking and lower educational attainment, if not paired with extracurricular participation and increased resilience. As such, resilience is hypothesized to be a direct outcome of adolescent extracurricular participation and a mediator between extracurricular participation and positive outcomes in emerging adulthood.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample</head><p>The sample contained emerging adults ages 18-25 (N = 281). Of the respondents, 60.5% identified as female, 38.4% identified as male, and 1.1% identified as non-binary. As for ethnic identity, 64.1% of respondents were White, 12.5% were Asian American, 10.8% were Black, 9.3% were Latino, 1.5% were Pacific Islander and 1.8% identified as other. All participants entered their age to verify only emerging adults were participating (M = 21.85, SD = 2.17).</p><p>The collected sample was made of particularly high achieving emerging adults, possibly due to self-selection bias or internet recruitment sampling bias. To quantify achievement, educational attainment was defined as the highest level of education received, and college GPA data were collected. Of the respondents, 0.4% reported a partial high school education, 25.6% reported a completed high school education, 32.4% reported a partial bachelor's degree, 24.6% reported a completed bachelor's degree, 17.1% reported a partial graduate degree. This study was open to a wide spectrum of emerging adults to gain a greater perspective of life outcomes across US regions and backgrounds. Participants were able to voluntarily submit the name of the last educational institution they attended, including universities or vocational centers.</p><p>Participants originated from over 50 institutions including multiple Ivy League and R1 universities. Beyond three-fourths of the sample pursuing higher education, the average college GPA (M=3.61, SD=0.42) exceeded the typical population. The 50 th percentile was 3.70, and the mode was 4.0 on a 4-point scale. This expansive sample was made possible by online survey recruitment. The researcher used the online platforms LinkedIn, CampusGroups, Reddit, and Instagram to spread the survey to social circles of emerging adults. These adults were then encouraged to spread the survey to their networks of peers ages 18-25.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Materials</head><p>The survey contained 35 questions divided into 4 subsections. The first survey section gathered demographic information from the participants including gender, age, ethnicity, educational attainment, college GPA (if applicable), number of high school extracurriculars, number of years participated, type of athletic/ non-athletic activity, fraternity or sorority affiliation, and current group activity participation. Questions pertaining to the type of activity and intensity of participation were asked to remedy gaps in the literature specifically mentioned in previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Kort-Butler &amp; Martin, 2015)</ref>. As described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Fischer et al. (2020)</ref>, there have been multiple approaches to quantifying extracurricular participation. Given that each activity differs, and students have their own attendance records, successful measurements of participation reflect temporal and categorical involvement. As such, the current study collected data on the number of years participated in at least one extracurricular and how many different extracurriculars each respondent was involved in. The extracurricular participation questionnaire can be viewed in the Appendix at https://osf.io/spr52.</p><p>The second section contained the Connor Davison Resilience Scale 10 (CD-RISC 10) <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Connor &amp; Davidson, 2003)</ref>. This unidimensional scale has 10 items on which respondents choose their level of agreement on a 5-point scale. The options include not true at all (0), rarely true (1), sometimes true (2), often true (3), and true nearly all of the time (4). The sum of these items was taken to create an overall resilience score. Psychometrically, it was validated at three undergraduate institutions. The CD-RISC 10 has good internal consistency with a Cronbach's alpha of 0.86 <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Kuiper et al., 2019)</ref>. Third party review supports its use for resilience quantification <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Campbell-Sills &amp; Stein, 2007)</ref>.</p><p>The third section consisted of the Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE) scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Felitti et al., 1998)</ref>. This scale has 10 items listing possible adverse events. Respondents answer yes (1) or no (0) if that event happened to them during their first 18 years of life. The ACE scale has acceptable internal consistency with a Cronbach's alpha of 0.70 <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Oláh et al., 2023)</ref>. Research has shown that scores of 4 or more correspond significantly with negative health outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Felitti et al., 1998)</ref>. It is imperative to understand that this score is meant to assess trends and that no one score should be used to quantify a specific individual's risk <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Narayan et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>The final section held the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Concise (AUDIT-C) <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bush et al., 1998)</ref>. The AUDIT-C was modified from the full version to be able to assess risky drinking behaviors effectively but quickly. This is a three-item scale that asks how frequently people drink, the typical number of drinks consumed on days they do drink, and how often people drink 6 or more drinks in a single occasion <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bush et al., 1998)</ref>. The AUDIT-C has good internal consistency with Cronbach's alpha of 0.81 <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Reinert &amp; Allen, 2007)</ref>. Not only was this scale psychometrically validated for use, but it also performed more effectively than the full version for screening college aged samples <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bush et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">DeMartini &amp; Carey, 2012)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure</head><p>Prior to data collection, this study received institutional review board approval.</p><p>Participants were first directed to an informed consent page. After giving voluntary consent, participants completed a demographics questionnaire, extracurricular participation questions, the Connor Davison Resilience Scale 10 (CD-RISC 10), the Adverse Childhood Experiences Scale (ACE), and the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Concise (AUDIT-C). For the current study, participants' CD-RISC 10 scores were used to quantify their overall resilience, ACE scores were used to quantify adverse childhood experience exposure, and the sum of typical number of drinks consumed per night drinking and binge drinking frequency were used to quantify regular heavy drinking. Previous extracurricular participation (PEP) was determined by the number high school extracurricular activities reported by participants. Once data collection concluded, the researcher used statistical analysis software including SPSS, R, and lavaan packages to assess trends. Procedures included correlation calculations and path analyses. A path analysis was performed to fit participant data to a model which depicted a possible way previous extracurricular participation (PEP), resilience, and Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) can influence life outcomes and drinking behaviors in emerging adults.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Life Outcome Correlations</head><p>The researcher performed correlational analysis to determine if there were associations between previous extracurricular activity, resilience, and behaviors in emerging adulthood (see Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). Overall, 96.4% (n=271) of respondents participated in at least one extracurricular activity during high school. The number of previous extracurricular activities was found to positively correlate with resilience (r = .23, p &lt; .001) and current extracurricular participation (r = .66, p &lt; .001). The number of previous extracurriculars had a weak negative correlation with ACEs (r = -.19, p = .001). The number of years spent participating in extracurriculars was found to positively correlate with college GPA (r = .22, p = .001). Correlations found through this study's naturalistic approach suggest that relationships between previous extracurricular participation and life outcomes are present across widely varying activities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Resilience Correlations</head><p>Resilience was found to positively correlate with educational attainment (r = .24, p &lt; .001) and negatively correlate with binge drinking (r = -.23, p &lt; .001), regular heavy drinking (r = -0.21, p &lt; .001), and ACEs (r = -.20, p &lt; .001). These findings suggest that those with greater resilience tend to participate in extracurriculars more in high school, attain higher education, and participate in less risky drinking behaviors than people with less resilience. Moreover, when assessing the correlations of drinking behaviors, heavy drinking was found to correlate significantly with resilience at (r = -.21, p &lt; .001), but drinking frequency did not significantly correlate with resilience. These findings suggest those with high and low resilience tend to drink at a similar frequency, but those with higher resilience tend to drink in moderation when they do drink compared to those with less resilience. Age was not found to significantly correlate with resilience or drinking behaviors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ACEs Correlations</head><p>In addition to previously mentioned associations, ACEs were found to negatively correlate with years spent participating in extracurriculars (r = -.13, p = .03) and educational attainment (r = -.17, p = .006). ACEs positively correlated with binge drinking (r = .32, p &lt; .001) and regular heavy drinking (r = .33, p &lt; .001). The findings suggest that those with higher ACEs tend to participate in extracurriculars less frequently, attain higher education less frequently, be less resilient, and participate in riskier drinking behaviors more often than those with less ACE exposure.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Path Analysis</head><p>A path analysis was conducted to examine the relationships between PEP, ACEs, and resilience on high achieving emerging adults' life outcomes and risky drinking. The proposed path model expected resilience to mediate participation, ACE exposure, and life outcomes.</p><p>Participation and ACE exposure initiated indirect pathways in which resilience influenced later drinking behaviors and educational attainment. The model depicts this flow (see Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). The Comparative Fit (CFI) was .96 and Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI) was .91. Both values suggest the model is a good fit. However, the Chi-Square value for the model was significant 𝛸 ! (6) = 29.84, p &lt; .001, the Root Mean Square Error Approximation (RMSEA) value was 0.11, and the Standardized Root Mean Square Residual (SRMR) was 0.09, dampening the strong CFI and TLI. In all, the model suggests a moderate fit and does support the validity of previous extracurricular participation and ACE exposure, affecting life outcomes in emerging adulthood through resilience.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>The current study provides novel insight into how adolescent extracurricular activity may promote prosocial development with lasting protective effects on behavior and educational outcomes throughout emerging adulthood. Consistent with study hypotheses, significant positive correlations between PEP and resilience, educational attainment, and current participation in adulthood were found. However, resilience did not significantly correlate with college GPA. In the PEP-resilience analysis, resilience served as an outcome variable which established a direct effect between the two. PEP's significant positive correlation with resilience is particularly significant as it further supports existing literature's claims that youth programming can foster prosocial development <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Caldwell &amp; Witt, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Gestsdottir et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Gestsdottir &amp; Lerner, 2007)</ref>.</p><p>Exploring drinking behaviors, the current study hypothesized that high resilience would correlate with less risky drinking behaviors. This hypothesis was informed by previous studies that showed correlation between resilience, effective coping skills, and less frequent alcohol usage <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Antelo et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Wills et al., 2001)</ref>. It was expected that greater coping ability would decrease the need for substance assisted emotional regulation and thus drive down heavy drinking behaviors. Resilience correlated significantly with less binge drinking episodes in the current dataset. However, there was not a significant correlation between resilience and drinking frequency which contrasts with previous research <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Wills et al., 2001)</ref>. This pattern suggests that those with higher resilience may be motivated to drink for social benefit as opposed to coping needs. These findings align with a previous study which revealed that among those who had recent trauma exposure, those with higher trait resilience drank significantly less in the aftermath <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Cusack et al., 2023)</ref>.</p><p>As hypothesized, ACEs significantly correlated with increased risky drinking and less frequent extracurricular participation. These findings agreed with previous studies that showed high ACE individuals suffering from increased substance use, substance use disorder, and multimorbidity at higher rates than those not exposed to ACEs <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Felitti et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Senaratne et al., 2024)</ref>. This pattern of increased risk-taking behavior and substance use were specifically identified in adolescents <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Silva et al., 2024)</ref>. The current study depicts this identified population continuing their adolescent behavioral patterns into adulthood.</p><p>The resulting path analysis sought to validate patterns established through previous youth development research. The analysis did produce a moderate fit to the proposed model informed by Positive Youth Development theory (see Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). Previously, high self-efficacy was found to positively correlate with other prosocial attitudes and behaviors after successfully navigating challenges <ref type="bibr">(Bandura et al., 2003)</ref>. Proponents of the Positive Youth Development Theory expanded this idea and suggested that intentional programming could assist kids in developing prosocial traits by providing them a safe environment to build skills through overcoming group challenges <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Romer &amp; Hansen, 2021)</ref>. Longitudinal studies of kids participating in group extracurricular activities show children developing increased prosocial attitudes and successful development <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Busseri et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Forneris et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Gestsdottir &amp; Lerner, 2007)</ref>.</p><p>The current model sought to validate this premise by using resilience as a mediator of PEP, ACEs, and life outcomes. As a mediator, resilience could reflect pro-social development from PEP while also reflecting possible pro-social deficits from adversity exposure. Resilience was used as a proxy measure for self-efficacy given resilience has been found to be an advanced manifestation of self-efficacy and its protective effect for ACE-exposed populations <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Hamill, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Howell et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Schaefer et al., 2018)</ref>. The current study's CFI and TLI suggested a good fit while the RMSEA and SRMR values were mixed.</p><p>Generally, the CFI compares if data fits a proposed model better than a null model <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Kline, 2011)</ref>. The current study's .96 CFI suggests an excellent fit and implies meaningful relationships between variables. TLI is a similar fit index to CFI, but it also reflects the proposed model complexity <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Kline, 2011)</ref>. The current .91 TLI indicates a good fit suggesting the current paths explain the dataset to an acceptable degree. These findings hold significant weight as they support PYD's fundamental beliefs that activities can promote prosocial development and this involvement and prosocial trait development lead to better life outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Lerner, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Romer &amp; Hansen, 2021)</ref>.</p><p>The RMSEA estimates how well the model would fit the population when accounting for covariances <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Kline, 2011)</ref>. It is hypothesized this value was affected by its application to a particularly high achieving sample whereas the model was meant to reflect the general emerging adult population. Thus, these participants achieved favorable educational outcomes above the degree the model expected resulting in an increased error approximation <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Silva et al., 2024)</ref>.</p><p>Moreover, the strength of the model may have been weakened by neglecting prosocial traits besides resilience. Since SRMR reflects the average standardized difference between the observed and model-predicted outcomes, the slightly high (.09) value suggests that a contributing path may be missing <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Kline, 2011)</ref>. Similarly, the model's chi-square value was significant, which means the model has opportunity for enhancement. This supports the claim that resilience is only one part of the larger developmental process. Resilience is not the only prosocial trait linked to PYD and ACE buffering effects. The 5 C's are the leading model of PYD and are traits that have been shown to lessen ACE exposure effects. Connection has been shown to have a particularly strong buffering effect on anxiety, depression, and social disconnection in ACEexposed samples <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Crouch et al., 2019)</ref>. Overall, the consensus of the various fit statistics suggests that the current model is a moderate fit. While there may be room for further expansion, the present fit endorses previous research claiming extracurricular activities facilitate prosocial development that has lasting behavioral effects and buffers consequences from ACE exposure <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Lerner, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Schaefer et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Romer &amp; Hansen, 2021)</ref>.</p><p>Notably, the current study contributes to the scarce literature examining the long-term impact of extracurricular involvement. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Gardner et al. (2008)</ref> performed the first life outcome study which found adolescent extracurricular participation did significantly correlate to educational attainment, career, and civic engagement. However, Gardner did not explore trait outcomes. Building upon <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Gardner et al. (2008)</ref>, the current study's findings suggest that extracurricular involvement may indirectly encourage favorable life outcomes like higher educational attainment via directly developing resilience and prosocial traits that last into emerging adulthood.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations</head><p>Data occurred through internet-assisted snowball sampling and a single freerecall format due to location and testing duration limits. This sampling method created a large sample which improved statistical strength, but it may have limited generalizability. Similarly, this method was effective in reaching a geographically diverse sample, but possible selection bias from recruitment within internet social networks created a sample with particularly high college GPAs. There also may have been self-selection bias where possible participants only responded if they were confident with their academic performance in emerging adulthood. Given the sample of high-achieving emerging adults, the collected data most likely had restricted ranges for educational outcomes. For example, other studies had more drastic negative academic impacts for ACE-exposed individuals, yet the current study did not show a significant correlation between ACEs and GPA <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Mahoney &amp; Cairns, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Silva et al., 2024)</ref>. Since this study collected college GPA, those who may have had larger academic impacts may have self-selected out of attending college and thus this impact is not reflected in current data. Where GPA calculations may fall short, collected educational attainment data provides insight into participants who may have self-selected out of higher education. Moreover, the single recall format may have impacted data accuracy, especially for young adults retrospectively reporting adolescent extracurricular participation. While the study assumes accurate recall, improper recollection could have affected subsequent data analysis. The sample was restricted to US emerging adults, and results should only be generalized to that population. Likewise, the current study did not account for socioeconomics which has the potential to influence extracurricular participation and education <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Gardner et al., 2012)</ref>. Previous data controlling for socioeconomic status have supported the PYD framework, but status was not included in the current path analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Gardner et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Martin et al., 2013)</ref>.</p><p>Additionally, many correlations were found to be significant, but their strengths were not strong. Despite weak correlational strengths, these relationships were found to be naturally occurring across all extracurricular activities. Given the wide spectrum of accepted data and naturalistic approach, any significant effect provides meaningful theoretical support for these activities' potential.</p><p>Finally, the current study only collected data on resilience for prosocial traits. While literature links resilience to PYD and ACE exposure buffering, it is not the only prosocial trait to contribute to these outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Hamill, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Howell et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Schaefer et al., 2018)</ref>. The path analysis could have reached greater strength if a wider range of advantageous prosocial traits were included in the model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Directions for Future Research</head><p>It is the recommendation of the researcher for further research to be performed analyzing the longevity of extracurricular participation's benefits into emerging adulthood and how these activities can be intentionally utilized in schools to promote long-term success.</p><p>The current study had a single data collection period for a retrospective, self-report study.</p><p>Longitudinal study with multiple data collection points and more focused extracurricular inclusion parameters may result in more robust data. Data collection through tangible means such as employment and academic records is suggested to complement self-report data.</p><p>Likewise, exploration of other life outcomes such as employment, finances, and belief systems and expansion into other prosocial attitudes or socioeconomic status may provide insightful context. Elaboration self-efficacy measures may also provide insight into the development of these attitudes and behaviors. Specifically possible prosocial development to buffer binge drinking behaviors may encourage more responsible social drinking.</p><p>Furthermore, experimental research into adding intentional prosocial interventions into the framework of pre-existing extracurriculars could provide a means of accessible and readily engaged with prosocial development within schools. Socioeconomics can restrict youths from participation and receiving developmental benefits <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Gardner et al., 2012)</ref>. Despite varying levels of resources, most schools do provide funding for athletics and arts programming. Providing psychoeducation and basic, easy to implement resiliency skills to these established coaches and directors could provide an avenue to reach students in schools that are typically underserved. This research would be a proactive approach to providing schools with non-clinical, prosocial development tools. These resiliency skills could be taught to improve performance in the extracurricular activity. As they are employed during the activity, they are then adopted into the youths' repertoire and can be called upon when needed to handle the stressors of daily life.</p><p>Preliminary versions of this concept are already being tested within high school athletics <ref type="bibr">(Bryant, 2016)</ref>. Through the 2010s into early 2020s, some youth sport coaches started to adopt and use "mental skills" for their athletes. This involved quick lessons during practices on sport psychology tools such as visualization, goal setting, and mindful breathing for gametime use. This movement gained momentum within coaching circles and some coaches began to develop their own curriculums <ref type="bibr">(Bryant, 2016)</ref>. This pursuit does hold promise as systematic review of short, tool-focused sports psychology interventions did find these lessons provided meaningful enhancement for high performing athletes <ref type="bibr">(Reyes-Bossio et al., 2022)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>In all, the current study aimed to examine the impact of extracurricular activity and resulting protective factors' longevity into emerging adulthood. Specifically, resilience was explored as a possible protective factor developed within these extracurriculars that could be employed during emerging adulthood to achieve greater educational outcomes and resist risky drinking behaviors. Adverse Childhood Experiences were also examined within this dynamic as their occurrence is common throughout the school population and has been historically recognized as significant risk factors. Previous research provides many examples of resilience development through extracurricular participation and correlation with academic and behavioral benefits. These benefits extended to those who were exposed to multiple Adverse Childhood Experiences. However, there is a current lack of research into the longevity of these benefits. The current study hopes to minimize this literature gap. The results suggest that extracurricular participation and resilience do significantly correlate. Moreover, resilience had significant positive correlations with educational attainment and safe drinking behaviors even after adolescent participation ceased. The data was meaningfully fit to a model via path analysis that suggests that resilience developed through extracurricular participation and impacted by ACEs has a significant positive effect on educational outcomes and risk-adverse behavior into emerging adulthood. The findings may be valuable in encouraging more meaningful participation and the possible implementation of intentional prosocial skill-building lessons within established extracurriculars to enhance positive youth development in an accessible manner.</p></div>		</body>
