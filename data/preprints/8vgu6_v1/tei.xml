<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>International organizations (IOs) typically have large bureaucracies that handle the dayto-day operations of the organization, and these bureaucracies have a large influence on the ability of IOs to achieve their goals <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Eckhard and Ege 2017)</ref>. To staff these bureaucracies, IOs must hire staff from the pool of applicants that come from the member states of the IO. Ideally, the staff recruited for positions at an IO would be representative of the member states that the IO commits to working with. However, in reality it is often difficult to achieve perfect representation for each member state. This may be because of competitiveness of the IOs wages compared to member state wages, or because educational and professional opportunities are unevenly distributed across member states. Therefore, these organizations typically must decide whether they will prioritize hiring to maximize representation of members states (geographic representation) or based on qualifications of applicants alone. Some organizations, like the IMF and the World Bank, prioritize qualifications and focus on hiring candidates from top university programs <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Yi-chong and Weller 2018)</ref>. The European Union, on the other hand, explicitly prioritizes a geographic balance of staff members, although it qualifies that deviations from geographically representative guidelines are sometimes "necessary to prevent the risk of inefficiencies" <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Commission 2018</ref>).</p><p>The idea that there is a trade-off between bureaucratic capacity and geographic representation in international organizations (IOs) implies that geographic representation, while important for reasons of legitimacy and representation, has little to no effect on enhancing the capacity of these organizations. However, the importance of the knowledge and expertise bureaucrats have about their home states (first nationality) is understudied in the literature. IOs need to be informed on the political, economic, and cultural background of many (often vastly distinct) states in order to be effective. Nationals of a member state, therefore, will have an advantage when it comes to monitoring and implementing policy in their own state. Thus, IOs with geographically diverse and representative staff will have workers with "national expertise" from each member state, while an IO that does not have a representative staff will lack national expertise for some of its member states. This paper examines whether higher levels of national expertise lead to better information capacity.</p><p>I estimate the effect of national expertise on IO capacity in the context of the European Commission, the executive branch of the EU. The Commission oversees the implementation and administration of EU policies through various policy departments known as Directorates-General (DGs). The DG for Economic and Financial Affairs (ECFIN), is tasked with conducting and publishing economic forecasts to monitor market conditions in EU member states. ECFIN relies on the expertise of its diverse staff, who come from all member states, to produce accurate forecasts essential for monitoring economic conditions and potential violations of EU economic criteria (European Commision, ) . These forecasts are published biannually and are publicly available going back to 2011. I use the accuracy of these forecasts as a proxy for the information capacity of ECFIN. This measure of capacity is best suited for my analysis, because measures that rely on the academic or professional qualifications of bureaucrats in the commission arguably do not capture ECFIN's ability to be effective at its goals.</p><p>To proxy national expertise, I use first nationalities of ECFIN staff. I find that increasing national expertise leads to more accurate economic forecasts. In substantive terms, the effect of hiring an additional national to ECFIN leads to a 2.5-2.6% increase in revenue forecast accuracy and a 1.8-3.1% increase in expenditure forecast accuracy in the member state of the staff member's nationality. The effect of national expertise on forecast accuracy is largest for forecasts of member states with large economies and member states that are less wealthy, but suggestive evidence shows that even forecasts for small and rich economies in the EU can benefit somewhat from national expertise. This paper proceeds as follows. In section 2, I provide an overview on research that touches on bureaucratic capacity in IOs, and I explain the Commission's bureaucratic system. In section 3, I describe my empirical expectations given the theory I present.</p><p>I then outline my empirical strategy and the model specification used in my analysis.</p><p>Finally, section 4 shows the main results of this analysis along with interaction models that provide more detail about where national expertise is most effective.</p><p>It is widely acknowledged that the bureaucracies of IOs do influence policy making and governance decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Ege and Bauer 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Eckhard and Ege 2017)</ref>, so it is important to understand the factors that help these organizations function effectively. Research in international relations and public administration that examines the capacities of IOs typically focuses on the credentials of leaders <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Kille 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Murdoch, Trondal, and GÃ¤nzle 2014)</ref> or on the degree of independence IOs have from their constituent member countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Hawkins et al. 2006)</ref>. While these topics are worthy of study, they may reflect differences in organizational preferences (e.g., hiring preferences, reliance on member countries, etc.) more than the underlying capacity of an IO to achieve its goals. IOs need to be able to collect taxes, monitor member quotas, and carry out borrowing arrangements in order to fund themselves. They also need to be able to monitor the economic and political conditions of member countries in order to enforce policies. This type of capacity is sometimes referred to as "information capacity" in the state capacity literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Brambor et al. 2020)</ref>. Some research has been done examining the relationship between geographic representation (sometimes called "passport diversity") and bureaucratic expertise in IOs. In the context of the EU specifically, there is evidence that European Commission recruitment competitions that have nationality as a criterion put less emphasis on expertise requirements <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Christensen 2015)</ref> and that recruitment has become more generalist over time as geographic representation has become more important to the Commission <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Christensen, Bekerom, and Voet 2017)</ref>. However, as mentioned in the previous paragraph, changes in recruitment practices is an imperfect measure of the underlying capacity of the Commission.</p><p>Scholars have long argued that bureaucracies must be somewhat representative of their constituencies in order to be seen as legitimate <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Tilly 1975;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Weber, Roth, and Wittich 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Hood and Lodge 2006)</ref>. Recent research shows evidence that this might not need to come at the expense of expertise or efficiency. PÃ©rez-DurÃ¡n and Bravo-Laguna (2019) find that EU agencies (different from DGs) that are designed to be inclusive of member states do not have fewer experts with scientific training. Additionally, in a large meta-analysis of public administration research on representative bureaucracies in the US, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Ding, Lu, and Riccucci (2021)</ref> find that bureaucracies that work to hire staff that are demographically similar to the constituencies they serve can "bolster performance and productivity." The question of whether and to what extent representation matters in other contexts, like IOs, has not been examined.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Capacity in the EU</head><p>The European Commission is the executive branch or secretariat of the EU, and it is the largest employer in the EU. The Commission is responsible for implementing and administrating EU policies. To do so, the Commission relies on bureaucrats' expertise in order to fulfill its administrative duties efficiently and accurately. However, the Commission is also fundamentally committed to having a workforce that is representative in order "to be close to the citizens and to reflect the diversity of Member States" <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Commission 2018)</ref>.</p><p>The Commission recruits people to hire as staff through open recruitment competitions. For administrator positions, applicants first pass an array of tests that measure verbal and numerical skills, abstract reasoning, and situational judgement. Applicants who pass this pre-selection process are then asked to do case studies, group exercises, and interviews. After this second stage, those who are deemed capable of working at the Commission are put on a reserve list, which means they are eligible to be hired by any of the European institutions <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Christensen 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">EPSO 2010)</ref>.</p><p>The Commission is comprised of many policy departments (DGs) that are responsible for overseeing the executive functions of the EU, which includes proposing, implementing, and managing EU policy. The EU has many laws that require states to follow economic guidelines. As the Commission must ensure these laws are being followed across member states, it is important for the Commission to have accurate data about the economic conditions of member states that are gathered independently from member states themselves.</p><p>It is also important for the EU to have accurate forecasts on member country budgets, as countries that are in danger of violating economic criteria are to be put under surveil-lance (e.g., European <ref type="bibr">Commission (2024)</ref>). These forecasts are also taken seriously in European financial markets. Section C in the online appendix shows that government bond yields react to forecasts released by ECFIN (with joint significance tests showing a p-value of 0.001).</p><p>The DG for Economic and Financial Affairs (ECFIN) is responsible for conducting and publishing these forecasts and their accompanying reports (Economic and Financial Affairs -European Commission 2025). ECFIN's staff is mostly comprised of administratorlevel positions and includes staff members from almost every EU member state every year. 1 Because these forecasts are important for the EU, there is a large incentive for ECFIN to make forecasts that are as accurate as possible. This accuracy depends on both the economic modeling knowledge and field knowledge of ECFIN staff 2 (European Commision, ). Thus, if economic forecasts improve because of changes in the composition of staff, it should be attributable to ECFIN's higher capacity.</p><p>It is important to note that ECFIN staff are not typically assigned to work solely on their own state's economic analyses and forecasts. This is typically done to avoid potential conflicts of interest with work done in the Commission <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Kassim 2013)</ref>. To illustrate, I examine the nationalities of heads of ECFIN subdivisions that focus on specific member economies in the July 2024 official EU directory. There are three such directorates (ECFIN E, F, and G), which are broken down further to units that focus on 2-4 member countries. I use forebears.io to find the country where the surname has the highest density to approximate the nationality of the administrators. As shown in table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>, only one of the three subdivision directors is in charge of a sub-division that includes her nationality, and none of the unit heads are over a unit that includes their nationality.</p><p>The fact that ECFIN does not typically assign staff to work on their own state's economic forecasts is important. If staff were assigned to work only on their home state's economy, the connection between staff nationalities and informational capacity would be simple, i.e. adding resources to a specific forecast makes the forecast better. Knowing 1. Occasionally there is no one from Luxembourg on staff at ECFIN. See figure 1 for more details. 2. ECFIN has a unit specifically in charge of economic forecasts (ECFIN.A.3, Economic situation, forecasts, business and consumer surveys), but the work that goes into making accurate forecasts will be a combination of the work of many staff throughout the DG. I argue that having a representative workforce is beneficial for the functioning of ECFIN, given that the EU needs accurate information on each member state in order to function well. Obtaining information on the economies of member states will be least costly for staff that have connections and familiarity with the economic systems in these states. For example, many ECFIN staff previously worked in the financial sector or central bank of their home state.<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">3</ref> Additionally, familiarity with the history, language, and current events of the state will be beneficial. This expertise that staff members have of their own states means they can easily help with forecasts pertaining to their home state, even if they are not assigned to work exclusively on their home economy (as is often the case). Thus, having staff that are representative of the EU's member states could lead to more accurate forecasts. On the other hand, staff from countries with less advanced university education systems or less professional opportunities may be less experienced to take on the tasks that are required to generate accurate forecasts.</p><p>To test this empirically, I use data from the Commission to see whether the "national expertise" that staff have results in more accurate forecasts. I proxy national expertise as the first nationality of staff members at ECFIN. Using first nationality is a conservative measure of national expertise, as staff may have multiple nationalities or other ties to member states that are not their first nationality. Therefore, the results from my analysis will likely be a conservative measure of the effect of national expertise on the capacity of ECFIN.</p><p>As an illustrative example, consider the effect of hiring a highly skilled Irish staff member to ECFIN. If there is a significant relationship between hiring an Irish staff member to ECFIN (i.e. increased "Irish expertise") and improved Ireland economic forecast accuracy (controlling for the size/composition of ECFIN and other country specific factors), this would be evidence that the expertise the Irish staff member brings to Irish forecasts improves Irish-specific capacity. If this effect holds across all staff members, this suggests that having geographic representation as a factor in recruiting may be an important factor in building and maintaining information capacity at ECFIN. If there is no significant relationship as described above, then I would not find evidence that national expertise matters for bureaucratic capacity at ECFIN.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Model</head><p>To estimate the effect of national expertise on capacity, the equation of interest is given by log(y</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">2 if ct ) = Î² 1 N E ct + ÎX + Î if ct + Ïµ if ct<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where i represents economic indicators, f indicates the year being forecasted (e.g. EOY or 1-year forecast), c represents member countries, and t represents the time period in which the forecast was made. y ict is the forecast error variable described above. I use squared error to measure inaccuracy broadly rather than differentiating between positive or negative errors, and I log transform the squared error to account for differences in the sizes of economies (and outliers therein) and to approximate a normal distribution. N E (National Expertise) is the number of employees at ECFIN that are of first nationality c at time t. X is a matrix of observables, namely population (logged), GDP (logged), and GDP per capita. I log transform population and GDP in order to approximate normal distributions in these control variables. Î if ct represents a matrix fixed effects included for economic indicator, forecast period, member country, and the time period in which the forecast is made.</p><p>GDP and population are used as controls to roughly proxy the size and/or complexity of an economy. While the country fixed effects control for average country differences in economies, adding these variables allows me to also control for changes in economies over time. Including GDP per capita in the model roughly controls for the wealth of countries over time, which could control for differences in a country's workforce over time. Economic indicator fixed effects control for the differences in how difficult individual indicators may be to forecast as well as differences in scale (i.e. direct taxes will be a larger quantity than capital taxes in most countries). Forecast year fixed effects will control for the differences in difficulty of forecast periods (i.e. longer vs. shorter term forecasts). Country fixed effects control for country specific factors, such as the amount of economic experts that could work at ECFIN. Finally, time fixed effects will control for EU-wide time varying changes. Importantly, this will control for the total number of ECFIN staff in each time period as well as the differences in reporting contracted staff workers that occurs after 2014.</p><p>The coefficient of interest is Î² 1 , which I argue is the effect of national expertise on ECFIN information capacity. This coefficient represents the effect of adding one more national from a member state to ECFIN on the member state's forecast accuracy. As the outcome variable is logged, this will be in terms of the percent of error for a given member state's forecasts. For example, if Î² 1 = -0.015, then adding a national to ECFIN will have the effect of a 1.5% reduction in forecast error. It is important to note that this effect is an average for all member states and all economic indicators. Therefore, it is possible that the effect is heterogeneous across member states or economic indicators.</p><p>I address this in section 4.4.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Main model</head><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> and<ref type="table">figure</ref>  The effects estimated in table 3 do not show the average effect of increasing the size of ECFIN staff, as time fixed effects control for the total size of ECFIN in any given time period. These results are robust to removing time periods that may have been affected</p><p>by COVID-19 uncertainty. They are also robust to filling in periods with missing ECFIN data using linear and spline interpolation (see section D in the online appendix). Country fixed effects control for any systematic (time-invariant) differences in ECFIN staff. GDP, population, and GDP per capita roughly control for the size and wealth of a member economy. This may control for changes in quality of recruits over time, which the country fixed effects do not control for.</p><p>The point estimate of the effect of national expertise on revenue forecast accuracy is quite stable across models (between -0.024 and -0.026), while the magnitude of the effect in expenditure models varies from -0.018 and -0.031. As the outcome variable is log </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Randomization Inference</head><p>The models in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> show the results of ECFIN staff on their own member state's forecasts, but they do not take into account that the work ECFIN staff do will most likely improve other member states' forecasts as well. While I control for the general size of ECFIN staff, it is possible that the model is not picking up national expertise but rather something more broad. This could be knowledge of a specific region within Europe, familiarity with countries that have similar economic systems, or ties between higher education systems across countries. If this were the case, then strict geographic representation would not be crucial for improving capacity.</p><p>To make sure the effect I estimate is not one of these broader factors, I conduct a Monte Carlo simulation in which I randomly assign ECFIN staff members to EU state forecasts, using a combined model specification that includes both revenue and expenditure 1-and 2-year forecasts. In other words, I conduct simulations in which the staff of a certain nationality are randomly linked to the forecasts of a potentially different mem-  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Marginal Effects</head><p>The main model shows the general effect of national expertise on forecast accuracy.</p><p>However, this is effect is likely to be dependent on the current level of representation from a given member state. Member states that are already well represented would likely see much smaller gains in forecast accuracy from an additional staff member being added to ECFIN and vice-versa. Thus, the effect of adding an additional national to ECFIN should be larger if the member state was previously underrepresented and smaller if the state was previously overrepresented. In other words, I expect the effect of national expertise to be decreasing in member states' representation.</p><p>To test this expectation, I compare the actual ECFIN staff representation for a given member state to the level of representation suggested by the Commission's guide rate.</p><p>In a 2018 Report from the Commission <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Commission 2018)</ref>, guidelines are given for the percentage of Commission staff that should be employed from each member state, called "guiding rates." Based on the details from Annex 5 of the report, I find that these percentages are calculated by taking the average of three proportions: country's population as a percent of the EU's population, the percent of seats the country has in the European Parliament, and the percent of seats the country has on the European council. When I calculate this for the year 2017 (as in the report), my calculation is nearly perfectly correlated with the reported guiding rates (Pearson's r = 0.98). The slight difference seems to come from the report's rounding of percentages to the nearest tenth of a percentage point, while I do no such rounding.</p><p>I run the forecast models that exclude EOY forecasts made in November (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>, Panel B models) with the addition of a new variable I call Representation. This variable is the guiding rate for a member state (calculated as described in the previous paragraph)</p><p>substracted from the percentage of ECFIN staff from said member state. Formally, the model can be written as</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">log(y 2 if ct ) =Î² 1 N E ct + Î² 2 Representation c,t + Î² 3 N E ct * Representation ct + ÎX + Î if ct + Ïµ if ct<label>(2)</label></formula><p>This is identical to (1), with the addition of Representation c t and the interaction N E ct *</p><p>Representation ct in the model. The estimate of interest is the marginal effect of national expertise, which is the partial derivative of the equation with respect to N E. Formally,</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">ây âx 1 = Î² 1 + Î² 3 Representation ct .</formula><p>Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref> show the marginal effect described. Importantly, the effect of national expertise decreases in representation for both revenue and expenditure forecasts. For revenue forecasts, the effect goes from a large (-6.8%) and significant effect on forecast error for underrepresented member states (about -8 percentage points below the guiding rate) to an insignificant (and positive) effect on forecast error for member states that are highly overrepresented (about 13 percentage points above the guiding rate). For expenditure forecasts, the decrease in the marginal effect of national expertise is much less dramatic (from -2.4% effect to -1.9% effect) and the interaction term is not statistically significant.</p><p>Thus, it does seem that the effect of national expertise is decreases in a member state's representation, although this interaction effect is largely driven by the effect on revenue forecasts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Interactive models</head><p>This section explores potential heterogeneity in the effect of national expertise across member states. First, national expertise may be helpful for less wealthy economies, but the effect might be negligible for wealthy countries with higher legibility, more predictable economic trends, or easily observable political and cultural environments. To address this, I re-run the models in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> Panel 2 (which exclude EOY forecasts made in November)</p><p>with an interaction for GDP per capita quartiles. Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref> shows this interaction, where the gray points show model 1 (Revenue) and black points show model 2 (Expenditure).</p><p>As Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref> shows, all but one of the point estimates are negative. For the least Thick lines: 90% confidence intervals, thin lines: 95% confidence intevals wealthy states (GDP per capita quartile 1), the effect is the largest and I reject the null hypothesis of no effect in both models. For all quartiles, point estimates for revenue models are negative and statistically significant at Î± = 0.05. These estimates are also substantively large, ranging from a 2.2-3.6% increase in accuracy. For expenditure, the point estimates are generally closer to zero and imprecisely measured. However, the estimates are negative for all except the wealthiest quartile (where the estimate is 0.003). Taken together, these results suggest that even wealthy states can gain information capacity from more national expertise.</p><p>The effect of national expertise may also vary depending on the size of the economy of the member state. Larger economies are likely more difficult to forecast than small ones. To investigate this, I run the models in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> panel B with an interaction for GDP quartile. The results of these models are shown in Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref>. All but two point estimates are negative, although the estimates for smaller economies (quartiles 1 and 2) are imprecisely estimated. The revenue model coefficient for 1st quartile countries is positive and somewhat large (0.033), but it is very imprecisely estimated and not statistically different from any of the other revenue coefficients. The effect of national expertise on revenue increases for larger economies, while the effect on expenditure is roughly the same across quartiles. Thus, I find evidence that national expertise is most effective for larger economies, although this is largely driven by the effect on revenue forecasts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusion</head><p>The European Commission is committed to having a staff that is geographically representative of its member states. Some argue that this means the Commission must sacrifice efficiency and expertise in order to achieve geographic representation (Yi-chong and Weller 2018).

Model 1 shows the estimates for revenue forecasts and model 2 shows expenditure forecasts. Panel A includes all forecast periods, Panel B excludes EOY forecasts that were made in November, and Panel C excludes all EOY forecasts. All models include fixed effects for economic indicator, period being forecast, member country, and the time period in which the forecast was made. The standard errors are clustered by country.A negative coefficient for national expertise indicates that national expertise increases forecast accuracy, since the outcome is forecast error squared. All models in all panels show a negative coefficient for National Expertise. For each estimate except for model 2 panel A, these coefficients are significant at Î± = 0.05. The coefficient in Model 2, Panel A is significant for Î± = 0.1 (p = 0.09), but in Panels B and C the estimates are significant at Î± = 0.01 and the magnitudes are larger. Since I expect EOY forecasts to be more straightforward than longer-term forecasts, it is intuitive that national expertise plays a larger role in longer-term forecasts.</figDesc></figure>

First, ECFIN publishes forecasts on many economic indicators for all member countries twice a year, and this data is publicly available on their website as early as 2011. For other measures of bureaucratic capacity (e.g. educational attainment of ECFIN employees or recruitment procedures), getting coverage this comprehensive would be difficult and costly, if not impossible. Second, ECFIN is incentivized to minimize error for all member countries. This is in contrast to other potential measures of capacity (e.g. of the IMF's contributors and senior officers (A9 -A15/A15) and the majority of senior managers and above (A14/15 -B5) were from the US, Canada, or Western Europe (IMF 2024), which are less than 19% of the 191 IMF member countries. The Commission, on the other hand, requires geographic balance to be considered in recruiting and releases recommendations on the percentage of staff DGs should have from each member country. Do these requirements result in a lower functioning bureaucracy in the Commission?</p></note></figure>
