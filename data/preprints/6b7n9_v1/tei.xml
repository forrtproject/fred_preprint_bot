<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This study employs an explanatory sequential mixed-methods design to investigate the characteristics and predictors of the popularity of AI curriculum materials on TeachersPayTeachers.com (TpT), mapping their structure and identifying key drivers of adoption. Using data from the year 2023, we outline the characteristics of AI curriculum materials and then utilize regression and qualitative analyses to investigate the key drivers behind their popularity. Our findings show that plug-and-play formats-especially activities and worksheets-predominate TpT's AI curriculum materials, while a rising shift toward concise "crash course" modules enriched with critical-thinking elements underscores a move toward lessons that are both highly accessible and intellectually engaging. Regression results indicate that higher downloads are significantly associated with subject areas such as Computer Science -Technology and language learning, high school grade levels, and worksheet formats, with free curriculum materials attracting substantially higher engagement. A qualitative case analysis further substantiates these results by demonstrating the efficacy of a concise, well-structured design featuring clear objectives, interactive assessments, and PDF formatting. This study provides the first comprehensive mapping of AI curriculum materials on TpT and identifies popularity drivers, suggesting these resources effectively address educators' need for ready-to-use, low-prep AI lessons that fit neatly into a single class period.</p></div>

Platforms such as Times Educational Supplement (TES),</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>TRENDS IN AI CURRICULUM MATERIALS</head><p>Teachers Notebook, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Marketplace, and Amazon Ignite have emerged as prominent sources of curriculum. These online hubs are widely regarded by preschool to 12th grade (P-12) educators as dependable repositories of teacher-created materials designed for classroom application <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Sawyer et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Hu et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Opfer et al., 2016)</ref>. Many teachers both purchase and sell curricular materials via online platforms. This phenomenon, often termed online teacherpreneurship <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Shelton &amp; Archambault, 2018)</ref>, has experienced significant growth alongside the expansion of online educational marketplaces.</p><p>In 2006, the online educational marketplace TeachersPayTeachers.com was launched.</p><p>According to Teachers Pay Teachers (2025), the platform now features over 7 million teacher-created lessons and has facilitated over 1 billion curriculum material downloads. It offers educators a dedicated venue to upload, share, and sell original classroom materials. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Aguilar et al. (2022)</ref> reported that over 69% of transactions involve free curriculum materials downloads and that 92% of paid transactions are for items priced at $5 or less. Furthermore, excluding free listings and downloads, <ref type="bibr">Shelton and colleagues (2021)</ref> found that the average item price was $4.38, with the average transaction amount totaling $8.28.</p><p>Teachers frequently used TPT to gather and share classroom ideas, while TPT teacherpreneurs leveraged these online spaces to promote and sell their curriculum materials <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Schroeder et al., 2019)</ref>. In 2012, U.S. teacherpreneur Deanna Jump garnered attention as the first educator to earn one million dollars from selling her curriculum materials on TpT <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(CNN, 2012)</ref>. The success of these teacherpreneurs highlights the strong demand for teacher-created curriculum materials and suggests that the widespread use of TpT has significantly influenced both educators' pedagogical practices and the curriculum experienced by students.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>TPT AI Curriculum Materials</head><p>Drawing on the work of Shelton and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Carpenter &amp; Shelton, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Shelton et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Shelton et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Shelton &amp; Archambault, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Shelton et al., 2023)</ref>, we consider TpT AI curriculum materials as discrete, standalone instructional resources designed to support the teaching of AI-related content. These materials typically serve as supplementary components within a broader course, rather than forming a comprehensive curriculum. They appear in diverse formats-including activities, readings, worksheets, lesson plans, guides, and professional development modules-and are intended to target specific AI skills or concepts within educational practice.</p><p>While AI curriculum materials have proliferated, there remains little systematic research on their presence in online marketplaces. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Allman et al. (2024)</ref> found that AI curriculum materials on TpT nearly tripled in 2023 compared to 2022, reflecting a growing interest in AI within education. This rapid expansion highlights the need to map how these curriculum materials are structured in terms of key attributes such as grade level, resource type, subject, file type, cost, and downloads. A clear understanding of these attributes provides a baseline for future studies on how AI curriculum materials evolve in online marketplaces. As teachers increasingly source supplementary materials from online marketplaces like TpT <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Archambault et al., 2021)</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Collection</head><p>We employed web scraping to systematically extract publicly available data from TpT, following best practices outlined by <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Munzert et al. (2015)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Greenhalgh et al. (2020)</ref>. While our institutions did not classify this method as human subjects research, ethical considerations remained central to our approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Greenhalgh et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Henderson et al., 2013)</ref>. Following the guidelines of the SIGCHI Ethics Committee (2017), we ensured that no personally identifiable information was collected, and the research value justified the use of web scraping.</p><p>Our dataset comprises 1,607,767 entries from TpT for the year 2023, from which we identified 2,254 AI-related curriculum materials based on keyword filtering. Keywords used were "generative artificial intelligence," "generative AI," "artificial intelligence," "DALL-E," and "ChatGPT." The data collection process followed methodologies previously applied in educational technology research <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Shelton et al., 2021)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Cleaning and Processing</head><p>The data underwent a series of preprocessing steps to ensure analytical rigor. First, we removed duplicate entries and assigned each curriculum material a unique ID. We then selected key variables, including title, grade level, subject, resource type, file type, description, follower count, cost (discounted), and downloads. Multi-tag variables such as grade level, subject, resource type, and file type were expanded into separate binary indicators. Text preprocessing was applied to the description variable, including tokenization, stopword removal, punctuation filtering, and the elimination of special characters. Since the distribution of downloads was highly skewed, a logarithmic transformation was applied to normalize the data, making it more suitable for regression analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Analysis</head><p>This study employed a mixed-methods approach, specifically an explanatory sequential design, to explore the research questions. An explanatory sequential mixed-methods design begins with quantitative analysis to identify general trends and relationships, followed by qualitative analysis to provide deeper understanding and explanatory insight into these initial findings <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Creswell &amp; Plano Clark, 2017)</ref>. We selected this design because it allowed us to first statistically assess the characteristics and popularity of AI curriculum materials on TpT, then use qualitative methods to further interpret and contextualize these quantitative results.</p><p>For RQ1, we conducted a descriptive statistical analysis to explore the structure of AI curriculum materials on TpT. The frequency and distribution of AI curriculum materials were analyzed across key attributes, including grade level, resource type, and subject, with the top 15 tags examined in each category. Additionally, the distribution of file types was analyzed by identifying the ten most common file formats and reporting their frequency, percentage distribution, average discounted price, total downloads, and mean downloads per curriculum material. Last, a bigram analysis was performed on the curriculum material description to identify the 10 most frequently occurring two-word phrases and their percentages.</p><p>For RQ2, we investigated the drivers of AI curriculum material popularity on TpT using regression model with log-transformed download counts as the outcome. All predictors were entered as categorical factors via dummy coding. Specifically, subject area, grade level, and resource type were each represented by indicator variables for their fifteen most frequent tags (e.g., Science; English Language Arts; Computer Science; 4th-8th grade; Homeschool; Higher Education; Activities; Worksheets; PowerPoint Presentations), while file type was similarly coded for the ten most common formats (e.g., PDF, Google Slide, JPEG). We also included ten binary bigram flags to capture the presence of high-frequency two-word phrases in resource descriptions, and treated discounted cost as a four-level nominal factor (Free, Low, Medium, High) to assess the impact of pricing on download patterns. To complement these quantitative findings, we conducted a qualitative case study of the top 20 most downloaded AI curriculum materials, analyzing their design and content characteristics concerning key features identified in RQ1. These curriculum materials were examined in terms of grade level, subject, resource type, and file type, providing deeper insights into the composition of the most popular AI curriculum material on TpT. Furthermore, one representative case from this set was selected for a more detailed analysis, offering illustrative examples of trends in AI curriculum materials design and use.</p></div>

This association suggests that tailoring materials to distinct developmental stages may enhance their perceived relevance and utility among educators. Regarding resource types, formats such as PowerPoint Presentations (β = 0.53, t = 4.91, p &lt; 0.001), Worksheets (β = 0.31, t = 4.28, p &lt; 0.001), Research materials (β = 0.41, t = 3.37, p &lt; 0.001), and Thematic Unit Plans (β = 0.34, t = 2.05, p &lt; 0.05) significantly predicted higher downloads. This finding reflects a clear preference for curriculum material formats that are perceived as effective and user-friendly, thereby facilitating their integration into classroom instruction.</p><p>Cost emerged as a critical determinant of curriculum material popularity. We categorized cost_discounted into four levels-"Free" (0), "Low" (≤ 1), "Medium" (≤ 5), and "High" (&gt; 5)-and used "Free" as the reference. Relative to free materials, those in the Low (β = -1.73, t = -11.45, p &lt; .001), Medium (β = -1.72, t = -16.61, p &lt; .001), and High (β = -1.82, t = -15.72, p &lt; .001) cost categories all had significantly lower download counts. This inverse relationship suggests that even modest pricing may serve as a barrier to adoption, thereby emphasizing the critical role of affordability in the widespread utilization of AI curriculum materials on the TpT platform.</p><p>From the regression analysis, we identified significant predictors of downloads such as file type (with PDFs leading), subject areas (Computer Science -Technology, Career and Technical Education, and EFL/ESL/ELD), specific grade levels (11th-12th, 3rd-8th, and 5th-8th), resource types (including PowerPoint Presentations, Worksheets, Research, and Thematic Unit Plans), and cost (with low, medium, and high prices negatively affecting downloads compared to free curriculum materials). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Selection Criteria for the Top 20 Free TPT AI Curriculum Materials</head><p>Following from the findings from the regression analysis which identified significant predictors of downloads, we developed a procedure for selecting the most downloaded, free materials. Specifically, we first ranked all AI curriculum materials by their download counts to identify those with the highest levels of engagement, initially focusing on the top 100 entries. To ensure robustness, we applied a minimum download threshold (downloads &gt; 90) and excluded entries with unreliable metadata-specifically, those containing promotional content or advertisements that redirect users to external shopping platforms, as well as curriculum materials that mention AI but do not pertain to AI-related educational content. Recognizing that curriculum material tags on TpT are manually added by content providers, we then conducted a manual review of the shortlisted entries to verify the accuracy of their subject, grade level, and resource type labels. This step ensured that only curriculum materials with reliable and consistent metadata were retained. Finally, we refined the ranking to obtain a final sample of the top 20 free curriculum materials that captured a broad range of subject areas, grade levels, and resource types. Given that our regression analysis indicated that cost significantly influences download counts, our focus on free curriculum materials inherently controls pricing effects. From the 20 aforementioned materials, we selected one (titled "Artificial Intelligence -AI -Reading Comprehension Worksheets") on the basis of its contrasting yet complementary attributes relative to the other 19. Specifically, this material was chosen because it exhibits the highest cumulative download count (n = 2,378), with its PDF format-recognized as the most dominant file type on TpT-reinforcing its wide accessibility and appeal. Moreover, the curriculum aligns strongly with the significant predictors identified in our regression analysis; it is categorized under the subject area of Computer Science -Technology is targeted at grades 7-12 and is formatted as a worksheet-factors that were statistically associated with higher downloads. Additionally, dynamic tracking revealed that the download count increased from 817 in February 2024 to 2,378 by February 2025, corresponding to an average of 4.27 downloads per day. This robust performance substantiates its status as the most highly engaged curriculum material among the top 20 free AI curriculum materials.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Case Analysis of the Most Downloaded AI Curriculum Material</head><p>The curriculum material is titled "Artificial Intelligence -AI -Reading Comprehension</p><p>Worksheets" and centers on the provocative question, "Will Artificial Intelligence Take Over?" It outlines clear objectives:</p><p>• To identify the three main types of Artificial Intelligence,</p><p>• To compare and contrast Narrow AI and Real AI,</p><p>• To explain the diverse ways Narrow AI learns and functions, and</p><p>• To identify the possible pros and cons of Narrow AI.</p><p>This content design facilitates a foundational understanding of AI concepts and promotes critical thinking, an approach that resonates with the pedagogical preferences revealed in our quantitative analysis.</p><p>Delivered in PDF format, this curriculum material comprises 8 printable pages and includes an answer key that is readily accessible to teachers. Its clean, well-organized layout enhances usability, while the structured presentation of learning objectives and corresponding questions enables educators to seamlessly incorporate the material as either a primary lesson or a supplemental activity. Notably, three of the pages are dedicated to concise content segments that address key aspects of AI: defining what AI is, exploring what AI can do, and examining the impact of AI. The assessment design predominantly features multiple-choice questions aimed at evaluating comprehension, supplemented by True/False items that foster students' initial critical thinking regarding AI-related information, details see Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>. Overall, the content is highly structured and succinct, reflecting the emerging "crash course" trend identified in our topic modeling analysis of AI curriculum material descriptions.</p><p>User feedback further substantiates the practical value of this material. One reviewer commented, "This was a good curriculum material to use when I needed a 'filler.' Not too short, not too long. We had a good discussion about the topic, highlighting its balanced length and capacity to facilitate classroom discussions. Another educator described it as "an engaging AI curriculum material-perfect for building comprehension and introducing tech concepts. Highly recommend!", underscoring its effectiveness in conveying complex AI ideas in an accessible manner. In addition, a teacher noted that the lesson was "a great, easy-to-understand intro for middle or high school students" with clear objectives that effectively differentiated between types of AI and the distinctions between Narrow and Real AI. This educator also mentioned that the curriculum material worked well as a substitute plan in a coding class, providing sufficient TRENDS IN AI CURRICULUM MATERIALS structure for independent student work and sustained engagement. Furthermore, another reviewer emphasized that their students were actively engaged in the activity, which sparked insightful discussions about the role and use of AI and stated that they would use the product again. While a few minor concerns were raised regarding the alignment of the answer key with the reading materials, these issues did not detract from the overall positive reception and high practical value of the curriculum material.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>In this section, we summarize the key findings organized by research question and discuss their significance. We adopted an explanatory sequential mixed methods design <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Creswell &amp; Plano Clark, 2017)</ref>, first employing quantitative analyses to broadly characterize the AI curriculum marketplace on TpT and identify predictors of material popularity. Then, we conducted qualitative case studies to explore these quantitative findings in greater detail. This mixed-methods approach allowed us to comprehensively describe key trends and subsequently examine specific examples, enriching our understanding of how educators select and utilize popular AI curriculum materials.</p><p>For RQ#1, regarding the characteristics of AI curriculum materials on TpT, our analysis reveals that curriculum materials focused on Computer Science -Technology and English Language Arts are predominant, suggesting these disciplines are at the forefront of integrating AI concepts into the curriculum. Activities and worksheets are the most frequent resource types, indicating that educators prefer interactive and easily accessible materials that can be quickly integrated into their teaching practices. Although K-12 curriculum materials constitute the majority of the offerings, it is noteworthy that 46.54% of the AI curriculum materials are specifically designed for homeschool educators, reflecting a growing demand for AI tools in non-traditional educational environments. Our content-pattern analysis reveals a dual trend: AI curriculum materials are simultaneously catering to teachers' demand for low-prep, "crash course" style modules and integrating higher-order competencies, such as critical thinking, media literacy, and digital ethics. This suggests that future AI curriculum design should strike a balance between plug-and-play accessibility and opportunities for deeper exploration, enabling educators to deploy concise introductory lessons quickly while offering modular extension activities that guide students toward more in-depth inquiry and practice.</p><p>These findings are significant for several reasons. First, they extend the existing research base: previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Allman et al., 2024)</ref> provided only a high-level trend analysis of AI mentions on the TpT platform-tracking aggregate counts and year-to-year growth-but did not probe the internal structure of those resources. In contrast, our analysis of 2,254 AI-related materials uses systematic tag separation and descriptive statistics to map exactly how these curriculum resources are distributed across subjects, formats, and grade bands, offering the granular content profile that prior work lacked. In particular, we find that computer science and language-learning materials lead in AI adoption on the platform. Understanding these distribution patterns is critical for informing the development and adoption strategies of future AI curriculum materials and for guiding broader discussions on AI's role in shaping contemporary learning environments.</p><p>For RQ #2, the regression model (F = 10.5, R² = 0.34) underscored that AI remains centered in technical and language-learning domains. Materials tagged for EFL/ESL/ELD showed the strongest positive association with downloads (β = 0.37, p &lt; 0.001), with Career &amp; Technical Education (β = 0.28, p &lt; 0.01) and Computer Science -Technology (β = 0.22, p &lt; 0.01) also predicting higher uptake. By contrast, most other K-12 disciplines saw limited engagement. We further found that grade level-particularly high-school-and resource type (notably worksheets) significantly boost download counts. Cost emerged as a major barrier:</p><p>higher-priced AI materials experienced markedly fewer downloads, prompting our focus on the 20 most free curriculum materials for qualitative follow-up.</p><p>The selected AI curriculum material is the convergence of quantitative trends and practical efficacy observed in our study. The curriculum material's concise, "crash course" design-featuring clearly defined AI concepts, structured objectives, and assessment items that promote critical thinking-underscores its accessibility and pedagogical value. Dynamic tracking and positive teacher feedback further attest to its sustained engagement and practical utility, validating its representativeness within the broader landscape of TpT AI curriculum materials.</p><p>The worksheet's runaway popularity-2,378 downloads by February 2025-suggests it fills a reflect the practical application of these curriculum materials in classroom settings. To better assess their actual impact on learning outcomes, subsequent research should integrate data from classroom implementations and user interactions. Third, while the regression model identified significant predictors of downloads, it may not account for all possible factors influencing curriculum materials popularity. Variables such as marketing strategies and the degree of alignment with specific curriculum standards may also play critical roles. Future studies should explore additional variables to enhance the model's predictive power and provide a more nuanced understanding of educators' AI curriculum materials selection behaviors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Implications for Practice</head><p>This research has several practical implications for practice-in particular, for educators, and for the designers of materials (curriculum material developers and platform managers). For educators, the results underscore the importance of selecting curriculum materials that offer interactive, hands-on learning opportunities. Our analysis indicates that materials such as activities and "crash courses"-characterized by their concise structure and clearly defined learning objectives-can significantly enhance student engagement and comprehension. The detailed case analysis of the "Artificial Intelligence -AI Reading Comprehension Worksheets" further reinforces this point by demonstrating how a well-structured curriculum material, which combines interactive assessments and critical thinking prompts, can effectively foster classroom discussions. Educators are therefore encouraged to prioritize curriculum materials that are both pedagogically sound and tailored to the specific needs of their students, particularly in high-impact subject areas like Computer Science -Technology and language learning.</p><p>For curriculum material developers, affordability emerges as a critical determinant of curriculum materials uptake. Our quantitative findings clearly indicate that free and low-cost curriculum materials garner significantly higher download counts. The case analysis also </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>, a more detailed understanding of AI curriculum materials content is needed. Identifying common content patterns helps provide insight into what AI-related educational materials are being created and circulated. This is particularly relevant given the widespread attention surrounding tools like ChatGPT, yet limited knowledge about the specific instructional focus of AI curriculum materials. By analyzing curriculum material descriptions, this study contributes to a broader understanding of AI content development trends in teacher-driven marketplaces. Understanding what makes AI curriculum materials popular can provide insight into teacher preferences when selecting educational materials. While prior research has explored AI's role in education, there is little empirical analysis of which characteristics of AI curriculum materials correspond with higher adoption rates. Popularity metrics such as download counts may reflect patterns in teacher demand, helping stakeholders identify which subjects, formats, or price points are associated with greater engagement. Analyzing trends among the most downloaded AI curriculum materials further clarifies how teachers are integrating AI into instruction and what kinds of materials they find most useful. The overall purpose of this study, then, is to understand recent trends in AI curriculum materials. The following research questions guided our investigation: RQ1: What are the characteristics of AI curriculum materials on the teacher marketplace TpT? RQ2: What characterizes the most popular TPT AI curriculum materials?</figDesc></figure>

Delivered as an 8-page PDF, "Artificial Intelligence -AI -Reading Comprehension Worksheets" centers on the provocative question "Will Artificial Intelligence Take Over?" and scaffolds learning through four targeted objectives (types of AI; Narrow vs. Real AI; AI learning mechanisms; pros and cons), a mix of multiple-choice and True/False items, and a built-in answer key. Teachers praised its "perfect for a filler" length, "engaging intro for middle/high school," and seamless plug-and-play design, highlighting how guided questions reduce planning time and spark discussion.</p><p>The significance of these findings lies in their contribution to a deeper understanding of the factors that drive educators' preferences for AI curriculum materials. By identifying key predictors-such as subject relevance, grade level, resource type, and cost-this study equips educators with the insights necessary to make informed decisions regarding the selection and implementation of AI materials. Furthermore, the detailed case analysis provides practical insights into effective content design and pedagogical strategies, thereby offering valuable guidance for AI curriculum material developers and platform managers seeking to align their offerings with educators' needs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations</head><p>While this study offers valuable insights into AI curriculum materials on TpT, several limitations should be noted. First, our analysis is confined to data from the TpT and focuses exclusively on a complete natural year <ref type="bibr">(2023)</ref>. Although this dataset serves as a starting point, it may not capture the full spectrum of AI curriculum materials available on other platforms.</p><p>Future research should incorporate data from multiple platforms to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of the AI curriculum materials landscape.

Developers should therefore consider offering accessible pricing models and designing curriculum materials that are concise, user-friendly, and adaptable across various educational levels and contexts.</p><p>For platform managers, the increasing demand for AI curriculum materials underscores the need for robust curation. The positive feedback and high engagement observed in the case analysis suggest that when curriculum materials meet rigorous pedagogical objectives and align with key predictors-such as subject relevance, appropriate grade-level targeting, and effective resource types-they are more likely to be widely adopted. Platform managers can leverage these insights by implementing systematic curation strategies (e.g., peer review systems, integration of user feedback, and regular updates) to ensure that only curriculum materials with demonstrated educational value are prominently featured.</p></div>
