<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>lesbian women who fell in love with specific close male friends; these women acknowledged that their attractions remained primarily to women and considered their male partners an exception. However, a particularly striking example of the potential for sexual fluidity occurs within relationships where one partner comes out as transgender or nonbinary (TGNB) and the couple remains together <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Aramburu Alegría, 2013)</ref>. Even when a partner's gender transition occurs prior to the relationship, having a TGNB partner may cause an individual to more deeply consider to what extent their attractions reflect gender (e.g., attraction to femininity or masculinity), sex (i.e., physical characteristics such as beards, breasts, or genitals), or a gender/sex gestalt <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(van Anders, 2015)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sexual Identity Renegotiation in Trans-Inclusive Relationships</head><p>Given the potential for sexual fluidity among those in trans-inclusive relationships, some research has examined how having a TGNB partner influences one's own sense of their sexual identity. This research, which is almost exclusively qualitative, has generally pointed to three patterns: identity confirmation, identity revision, and identity deferral <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Aramburu Alegría, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Brown, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Chester et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Perri, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Pfeffer, 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Pfeffer, , 2017;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Platt &amp; Bolland, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Rosner, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Siboni et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Theron &amp; Collier, 2013)</ref>. Identity confirmation may occur when an individual's sexual identity poses no conflict with their partner's gender identity (e.g., a heterosexual or bisexual woman dating a transgender man; <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Theron &amp; Collier, 2013)</ref>, and having a TGNB partner may serve to reinforce the existing identity of plurisexual (e.g., bisexual, pansexual, queer) individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Brown, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Rosner, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Siboni et al., 2023)</ref>. Indeed, one prior study found that the majority (65%) of cisgender women partnered with a transgender individual reported no change in their sexual identity label relative to the start of their relationship <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Platt, 2020)</ref>, and another study found that a little over half (53%) of participants with TGNB partners reported no identity change or questioning as a result of their relationship <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Siboni et al., 2023)</ref>. In some instances, participants maintained their existing identity while considering their partner the exception, as in the case of some cisgender women partnered with transgender women who considered themselves heterosexual but used language like "situational" or "accidental" lesbian to describe their relationship <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Aramburu Alegría, 2013)</ref>.</p><p>In other cases, trans-inclusive relationships led participants to revise the labels they used to describe their sexual identity, often by switching from a more specific label like lesbian to a broader label like queer <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Brown, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Joslin-Roher &amp; Wheeler, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Perri, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Pfeffer, 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Pfeffer, , 2017;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Platt, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Platt &amp; Bolland, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Siboni et al., 2023)</ref>. Adopting a broader label was described as a way to validate the TGNB partner's gender identity, and additionally often served as a way to better describe the fluidity in participants' own experiences of their sexuality <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Brown, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Joslin-Roher &amp; Wheeler, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Perri, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Pfeffer, 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Pfeffer, , 2017;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Platt &amp; Bolland, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Siboni et al., 2023)</ref>. However, some participants acknowledged that the term "queer" was still an imperfect solution; while its flexibility could be freeing, queer could be so all-encompassing as to feel empty or meaningless <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Pfeffer, 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Pfeffer, , 2017))</ref>. Finally, some partners of TGNB individuals engaged in identity deferral, rejecting labels altogether due to the lack of a term that fit them <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Brown, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Joslin-Roher &amp; Wheeler, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Rosner, 2018)</ref>. Notably, a study of cisgender women partnered with transgender men suggested that participants had long and complex histories with attempting to find accurate language for their sexualities, and that this process of exploration predated their current relationship <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Perri, 2022)</ref>.</p><p>Regardless of whether or not partners of TGNB individuals select a new term for their sexual identity label, research consistently shows that they undergo a complex process of selfdiscovery or renegotiation related to their sexual identity <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Gunby &amp; Butler, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Pfeffer, 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Pfeffer, , 2017))</ref>. This process often includes positive outcomes such as feelings of personal growth and broadening one's perspective on sexuality and gender <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Platt &amp; Bolland, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Siboni et al., 2023)</ref>. The process can also be challenging; in particular, some cisgender women with transmasculine partners grappled with the loss of visibility as lesbian, a label they had often fought hard to claim <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Brown, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Joslin-Roher &amp; Wheeler, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Pfeffer, 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Pfeffer, , 2017;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Theron &amp; Collier, 2013)</ref>. Social ramifications of their partner's transition, such as feelings of disconnection from the LGBTQ+ community, took precedence over their partner's physical changes in many sexual minority women's accounts of their experiences <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Brown, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Platt &amp; Bolland, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Theron &amp; Collier, 2013)</ref>. It is worth noting that much of this research focuses on cisgender women partnered with transgender men <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Brown, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Joslin-Roher &amp; Wheeler, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Perri, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Pfeffer, 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Pfeffer, , 2017;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Theron &amp; Collier, 2013)</ref>; even in studies with broader recruitment criteria, cisgender women are often over-represented <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Platt, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Platt &amp; Bolland, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Siboni et al., 2023)</ref>. Does a person's sexual identity renegotiation process have implications for their individual well-being and for their relationship? Although the process of sexual identity renegotiation in response to a partner's transition or having a TGNB partner is relatively welldocumented through qualitative research, the implications of this process are less understood.</p><p>Research suggests that some individuals have greater propensity for sexual fluidity than others <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Diamond, 2008)</ref>, and that individuals with greater sexual fluidity in their attractions also more strongly endorse sexual fluidity beliefs, such as the belief that romantic love depends on the person not the gender <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Katz-Wise &amp; Hyde, 2015)</ref>. It is possible that individuals who conceptualize their sexuality as fluid are more easily able to accommodate their TGNB partner's gender identity into their schema of their sexual attractions and identity, regardless of the specific sexual identity label they use or any branchedness between their identity label and their partner's gender identity. In this way, people with stronger fluidity beliefs may experience less dissonance between their identity and their partner's, and this could potentially translate to greater satisfaction with sexual intimacy or with the relationship.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sexual and Relationship Satisfaction in Partners of TGNB Individuals</head><p>Although prior research has not explicitly considered the role of sexual fluidity in sexual or relationship satisfaction among partners of TGNB individuals, some research has examined other factors that contribute to partners' relationship satisfaction or well-being. Partners of TGNB individuals face a unique set of relationship experiences and challenges, a process that has been called "co-transition" by some researchers <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Theron &amp; Collier, 2013)</ref>. Partners may experience stigma and discrimination, isolation, or (particularly when disclosure occurs during the relationship) feelings of loss <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Gunby &amp; Butler, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Platt &amp; Bolland, 2018)</ref>. Many partners also describe positive changes as a result of co-transition, such as improved communication, a deepened emotional bond, greater appreciation for the gender spectrum, and having a happier partner <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Aramburu Alegría &amp; Ballard-Reisch, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Coppola et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Dierckx et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Gunby &amp; Butler, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Platt &amp; Bolland, 2018)</ref>. In one of the few quantitative studies on relationship quality in partners of TGNB people, <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Platt (2020)</ref> found that a shorter length of time in the relationship prior to the partner's transition and greater personal resilience each predicted higher relationship satisfaction, which in turn predicted higher commitment. For cisgender men partnered with transgender women, relationship quality was lower when the transgender partner reported greater stigma associated with their relationship, and when they experienced greater financial hardship <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Gamarel et al., 2014)</ref>. A recent study found that partners (about half of whom were TGNB themselves) reported higher sexual/relationship satisfaction if their TGNB partner had experienced surgical transition, particularly genital surgery <ref type="bibr">(Ockerman et al., in press)</ref>.</p><p>Taken together, these studies suggest a range of potential personal, social, structural, and transition-related characteristics can contribute to relationship satisfaction in this population.</p><p>Research on sexual satisfaction in trans-inclusive relationships has focused heavily on changes in the transgender partner's sexual function or satisfaction after hormone replacement therapy or other forms of medical transition; partner perspectives and the broader social context of the relationship are often neglected <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Burns et al., 2024)</ref>. The limited qualitative research on partner perspectives points to the importance of communication and trust in negotiating the potential for a TGNB partner to experience gender dysphoria during sexual activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Brown, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Siboni et al., 2022)</ref>. Related to sexual fluidity specifically, one qualitative study found that non-fluid lesbians expressed more concerns about their sexual desire for their transgender male partner relative to bisexual, queer, and fluid lesbian women <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Brown, 2010)</ref>. While this finding is suggestive that sexual fluidity could predict sexual satisfaction in those with TGNB partners, quantitative research to test this hypothesis is lacking. Studying sexual satisfaction in this population is important given that higher sexual satisfaction is associated with better physical and mental well-being (del Mar Sánchez-Fuentes &amp; Sierra, 2015) and higher relationship satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Byers, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Calvillo et al., 2020b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">del Mar Sánchez-Fuentes &amp; Sierra, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Fallis et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Fleishman et al., 2020)</ref> in other populations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Current Study and Hypotheses</head><p>The current study explored whether higher sexual fluidity beliefs predict higher sexual satisfaction in partners of TGNB individuals. In addition to sexual fluidity beliefs, relationship satisfaction was measured as a general factor expected to predict sexual satisfaction, given their interrelatedness in past studies of cisgender heterosexual and LGBTQ+ populations <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Byers, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Calvillo et al., 2020b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">del Mar Sánchez-Fuentes &amp; Sierra, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Fallis et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Fleishman et al., 2020)</ref>. Finally, LGBTQ+ community connectedness was included as a social factor that might be associated with sexual satisfaction in this population specifically, given the gaps in research on how social context relates to sexual satisfaction in partners of TGNB H2: Higher relationship satisfaction will predict higher sexual satisfaction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>Participants were recruited primarily from social media groups likely to include partners of TGNB individuals, such as the /mypartneristrans Reddit group, PFLAG, and private Facebook groups for partners and family of TGNB individuals. Participants were also recruited via the university Pride and Trans Wellness organizations, the psychology and behavioral neuroscience major listserv, and the author's social media accounts to allow for snowball recruitment.</p><p>Recruitment materials specified that the study was seeking individuals 18 years or older, of any gender identity and sexual identity, who currently had a romantic relationship partner who identifies as transgender and/or nonbinary to complete an anonymous online survey. Data were collected via Qualtrics from October to December 2022.</p><p>The number of individuals who viewed the initial survey page was 458, and of these, 397 consented to participate. Participants were excluded if they did not meet eligibility criteria (i.e., responding no to or failing to answer the required eligibility question about having a TGNB partner, or clearly indicating in the open-ended comments that their partner was not TGNB; n = 14) or for excessive missing data (n = 49). Additional responses (n = 159) were flagged as bots and excluded. Based on criteria from prior studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Griffin et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Simone, 2019)</ref>, bots were flagged based on illogical or nonsensical responses to open-ended questions, exact duplicate responses by sequential participants, inconsistent responses to demographic questions, or completing the survey in less than 5 minutes. In prior online studies, our lab has noted that recruiting from Reddit can result in bots infiltrating a survey, even with use of a captcha and the "prevent ballot box stuffing" settings in Qualtrics <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Goldey et al., 2024)</ref>.</p><p>All together, these exclusions resulted in a final sample size of 175 participants. A power analysis conducted with G*Power for a regression with up to six predictors (setting effect size at 0.15, alpha at 0.05, and power at 0.95) yielded a planned sample size of 150 participants.</p><p>Recruitment proceeded more quickly than expected, resulting in the 175 participants; it is also worth noting that the regression models ultimately had up to 10 predictors given the need to create multiple dummy codes to control for participant and partner gender identity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Design and Procedure</head><p>Participants completed an anonymous online survey that included a consent form and the measures described below 1 . Participants could choose to enter into a raffle for one of thirty $25 Amazon gift cards. On the consent form and at the conclusion of the survey, participants were provided with links to support resources including the university health and counseling center, the Trevor Project, Transgender Education Network of Texas, PFLAG, the National Alliance on Mental Illness, and the 988 Lifeline. All procedures were approved by the St. Edward's University IRB, and the study's pre-registration can be found in supplementary materials or at https://aspredicted.org/5QB_4R2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background, Relationship, and Sexual Identity Questionnaire</head><p>Participants indicated their age and race/ethnicity. Definitions were then provided for the terms cisgender ("someone whose gender identity corresponds to the one assigned at birth"), transgender ("someone whose gender identity does NOT correspond to the one assigned at their birth…may include people who are binary, nonbinary, genderqueer, etc."), and nonbinary ("someone whose gender identity does not strictly correspond with the gender binary ex. bigender, agender, third gender, genderfluid, etc."). Participants then indicated their gender identity [check all that apply with options of: cisgender man, cisgender woman, transgender man, transgender woman, nonbinary, genderqueer, other, and prefer not to say], and responded to a separate item about whether they self-identify as transgender. Participants responded to the same two items regarding their relationship partner's gender identity. Participants who had multiple current relationship partners (e.g., polyamorous relationship) were instructed to answer the questions about their TGNB partner, and if multiple partners are TGNB, the partner they had been in a relationship with the longest. Participants were asked about their relationship status, relationship length, and relationship characteristics (i.e., long-distance relationship, consensually non-monogamous relationship, whether you and/or your partner have children).</p><p>Participants were asked about the timing of their partner's gender identity disclosure or coming out (defined as "when your partner first told you that they identified as transgender or nonbinary") relative to their relationship [options: at the beginning of our relationship; during our relationship]. If disclosure occurred during the relationship, participants were asked to indicate how long ago. Next, participants responded to items about their own sexual orientation/identity. Participants were asked what label(s) they use to describe their sexual orientation currently [check all that apply with options of: asexual, bisexual, gay/lesbian, heterosexual, pansexual, queer, questioning, unlabeled/prefer not to label my sexual orientation, other, and prefer not to say]. Participants were then asked if they used a different label(s) before their current relationship (for those whose partners were out as TGNB at the beginning of relationship) or before their partner disclosed their TGNB identity (for those whose partners disclosed during the relationship), and if so, to indicate which label(s). Participants were also asked to indicate their agreement with two statements on a scale from 1 = Strongly disagree to 5 = Strongly agree: "Even before my current relationship, I questioned or explored my sexual orientation/identity" and "Even before my current relationship, I felt that available terms failed to properly describe my sexual orientation/identity." These items were included based on prior qualitative research showing that cisgender women with transmasculine partners had a long history of finding language inadequate to describe their sexual identities, often prior to their current relationship <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Perri, 2022)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Global Measure of Sexual Satisfaction (GMSEX)</head><p>The Global Measure of Sexual Satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Lawrance &amp; Byers, 1995)</ref> asks participants to rate their sexual relationship with their partner on five semantic differential items, with each item measured on a 7-point scale: very bad -very good, very unpleasant -very pleasant, very negative -very positive, very unsatisfying -very satisfying, and worthless -very valuable. The GMSEX was chosen to measure sexual satisfaction in this study for its brevity, unidimensionality, sound psychometric properties relative to other measures, and validity in participants in other-sex and same-sex relationships <ref type="bibr">(Calvillo et al., 2020a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Mark et al., 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Participants first answered a question asking them to indicate whether or not they are sexually active with their partner, defined as passionate kissing or any activity that involves you or your partner's genitals; only participants who indicated they are sexually active with their partner completed the GMSEX. Internal consistency for the GMSEX was high in this sample (⍺ = .95), and total scores were obtained by computing a mean for the five items, with higher scores reflecting higher sexual satisfaction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Quality Marriage Index (QMI)</head><p>The Quality Marriage Index <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Norton, 1983)</ref> was used to measure relationship satisfaction. The QMI was designed as a unidimensional, evaluative, "gestalt" scale of relationship quality and shows expected associations with variables such as perceived similarity of attitudes between partners and how often the couple seriously discussed ending the relationship <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Norton, 1983)</ref>. The QMI consists of 5 items on a scale of 1 = Very strong disagreement to 7 = Very strong agreement, such as "We have a good relationship" and "I really feel like part of a team with my partner" (⍺ = .95). A sixth item asks participants to indicate the point from 1 = Very unhappy to 10 = Very happy that best represents the degree of happiness, everything considered, in their relationship. All items were worded to refer to a relationship rather than to marriage. Total scores were obtained by summing the six items, such that higher scores reflect higher relationship satisfaction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Relationship and Sexual Intimacy Happiness Comparison Items</head><p>Participants who indicated that their partner's gender identity disclosure occurred during their relationship were asked to complete two additional items: 1) Relationship Happiness Comparison: "Compared to before your partner disclosed their transgender or nonbinary identity, how would you describe YOUR overall happiness with your relationship now?"; and 2) Sexual Intimacy Happiness Comparison: a similarly worded item that asked participants to compare "YOUR overall happiness with the sexual intimacy aspects of your relationship now?". These items were answered on a response scale from 1 = Much less happy to 7 = Much happier.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sexual Fluidity Beliefs</head><p>Katz-Wise and Hyde's ( <ref type="formula">2015</ref>) 5-item Sexual Fluidity Beliefs Scale was developed based on themes from <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Diamond's (2003a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Diamond's ( , 2005) )</ref> research on sexual fluidity. The scale measures beliefs related to a role for choice in one's sexual identity label, love depending on the person vs. the gender, uncertainty about future attractions, uncertainty about future sexual orientation identity, and one's sexuality as fluid. As expected, past research showed that participants who endorsed experiencing sexual fluidity in their attractions (i.e., a change in attractions to others over time in relation to gender) also endorsed higher sexual fluidity beliefs <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Katz-Wise &amp; Hyde, 2015)</ref>. Items are worded such that participants answer in relation to their own sexuality, not in relation to human sexuality in general. Example items include "For me, I believe romantic love depends on the person, not the gender" and "I don't know who (which gender) I will be attracted to in the future." In the current study, participants responded on a scale from 1 = Completely disagree to 7 = Completely agree (⍺ = .66), and total scores were computed by taking the mean of the five items, with higher scores reflecting higher fluidity beliefs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Connectedness to the LGBTQ+ Community</head><p>The Connectedness to the LGBT Community Scale developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Frost and Meyer (2012)</ref> measures the extent to which participants feel they have close, positive, and rewarding connections with the LGBT community. In prior research, the scale showed good reliability, convergent validity (e.g., with behavioral connectedness to the LGBT community), and discriminant validity (e.g., with general sociability) among sexual minority individuals across gender and race/ethnicity <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Frost &amp; Meyer, 2012)</ref>. In this study, "LGBT" was replaced with "LGBTQ+" in each item, and the final item which asks about bonds with other same-gender similar others (e.g., other gay men, other lesbian women) was omitted. Participants indicated their agreement with each of seven items on a scale from 1 = Disagree strongly to 4 = Agree strongly. Example items included "You feel you're a part of the LGBTQ+ community" and "Participating in the LGBTQ+ community is a positive thing for you". Internal consistency was good in this sample (⍺ = .88), and mean scores were computed such that higher scores reflected higher connectedness to the LGBTQ+ community.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Attention Check Items</head><p>Midway through the survey, participants responded to the item "To show you are paying attention, please select 'strongly agree' from the options below." At the conclusion of the survey, participants responded to an item indicating whether they were taking the survey seriously, or whether they were clicking randomly or joking. All of the participants included in the final sample indicated that they were taking the study seriously. However, 14 participants (8%) failed the 'strongly agree' attention check. As reported below, the pattern of results in the primary analysis was very similar with these 14 participants excluded, so results are reported for all 175 participants.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Analysis</head><p>Data were analyzed using SPSS version 29. Sample sizes vary across analyses, given that only participants who indicated being sexually active with their partner responded to the GMSEX, and only participants who were in their relationship prior to their partner's TGNB identity disclosure responded to the Relationship and Sexual Intimacy Happiness Comparison items. Continuous predictors in regression models were centered prior to analysis. Data for this study are not publicly available; given the potentially sensitive topic of the study, participants were assured in the consent form that only the researchers would have access to their responses.</p><p>The questionnaire and analysis code are available on the Open Science Framework at https://osf.io/g9x6c/?view_only=de496ba15b464010bd561135d9c69e1b.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participant and Relationship Characteristics</head><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> summarizes the demographic and relationship characteristics of the 175 participants. Many combinations of participant gender and partner gender were represented, but cisgender women with transgender women partners (n = 72) were the most frequent group in the sample, followed by cisgender women with transgender men partners (n = 29) and cisgender women with nonbinary partners (n = 28). Some participants (n = 18) self-identified as transgender themselves and had TGNB partners. The sample was relatively homogenous in terms of race/ethnicity (92% White, 11% Hispanic/Latino, 9% other groups; participants could check all that apply so percentages do not equal 100%), but ranged in age from 18 years to 71 years (M = 34.78, SD = 10.93). The majority of participants (68%) were married, engaged, or in a life partnership, with an average relationship length of 9.01 years (SD = 8.48). Although some participants indicated that their partner disclosed their TGNB identity at the beginning of their relationship (27%), the majority (73%) indicated their partner disclosed their TGNB identity during the relationship. For those whose partner came out during their relationship, coming out occurred 2.30 years ago on average (SD = 2.64). The majority of participants (64%) indicated that their partner began gender transition (defined as including social and/or medical transition) during their relationship. Most (82%) reported that they are sexually active with their partner.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Descriptive Statistics and Correlations</head><p>Descriptive statistics and correlations between the main study variables are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>. In bivariate correlations, higher sexual fluidity beliefs were associated with significantly higher scores on measures of relationship satisfaction (i.e., QMI and Relationship Happiness Comparison item), but not significantly associated with measures of sexual satisfaction (i.e., GMSEX and Sexual Intimacy Happiness Comparison item). Higher LGBTQ+ community connectedness was significantly associated with higher sexual satisfaction, relationship satisfaction, and sexual fluidity beliefs. As expected, measures of relationship satisfaction and sexual satisfaction were strongly correlated.</p><p>Among participants who had been in their relationship prior to their partner coming out as TGNB (n = 127), the majority indicated being equally happy or happier with their relationship now, compared with before their partner disclosed their TGNB identity. Responses to the item on happiness with sexual intimacy relative to pre-disclosure were variable, with "about the same" as the most frequent response (see Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sexual Identity Labels</head><p>Participants reported using a wide variety of current identity labels, with bisexual (n = 53), heterosexual (n = 44), queer (n = 44), pansexual (n = 32), and gay/lesbian (n = 21) being the most commonly selected in the check-all-that-apply question; 47 participants selected multiple labels. Of the 48 participants whose partners disclosed their TGNB identity at the beginning of their relationship, 11 (23%) reported using a different sexual identity label(s) prior to their current relationship. Of the 127 participants whose partner came out during their relationship, 37 (29%) reported using a different sexual identity label(s) before their partner disclosed their TGNB identity. Participants who reported using a different sexual identity label before their relationship or before their partner came out were coded as identity shifters (n = 48); those who answered 'no' to this item were coded as non-shifters (n = 127). Among identity shifters, most shifts (n = 34) involved a shift to a broader label(s), or a label potentially encompassing attraction to more genders/sexes, such as bisexual to pansexual, heterosexual to bisexual, bisexual to queer, or adding queer to other identity labels (e.g., queer and gay/lesbian). A few participants indicated shifts from heterosexual to unlabeled (n = 5), from heterosexual to asexual (n = 2), or to more specific labels (e.g., bisexual to gay/lesbian, n = 2). Several participants (n = 5) experienced other shifts that did not fit any of these categories, such as from pansexual to questioning (see Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>).</p><p>Relative to non-shifters, those who shifted their identity labels had significantly higher sexual fluidity beliefs, t(173) = 2.85, p = .005, d = 0.48, but did not significantly differ in sexual satisfaction (as measured by the GMSEX or the Sexual Intimacy Happiness Comparison item), relationship satisfaction (as measured by the QMI or the Relationship Happiness Comparison item), or LGBTQ+ community connectedness (all p's &gt; .10) (see Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). Identity shifters were significantly more likely to endorse the statement, "Even before my current relationship, I felt that available terms failed to properly describe my sexual orientation/identity", t(172) = 2.97, p = .003, d = 0.50. However, identity shifters and non-shifters scored similarly on the item "Even before my current relationship, I questioned or explored my sexual orientation/identity" (p = .791) (see Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>). Therefore, those who shifted their identity labels in response to their relationship with a TGNB partner endorsed stronger sexual fluidity beliefs and were more likely to agree that available terms failed to describe their sexual orientation even before their current relationship. However, whether or not participants shifted their identity labels did not predict their sexual or relationship satisfaction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Predicting Sexual Satisfaction</head><p>To test the primary hypothesis, a hierarchical multiple regression was conducted to evaluate how sexual fluidity beliefs, QMI scores, LGBTQ+ community connectedness, and control variables predicted sexual satisfaction as measured by the GMSEX. The first step included control variables -participant gender identity, participant self-identification as transgender, partner gender identity, relationship length, and disclosure timing (before vs. during the relationship). The second step added the primary variables: sexual fluidity beliefs, the QMI, and LGBTQ+ community connectedness. The full model (Step 2) explained 39.2% of the variance in sexual satisfaction (R 2 adjusted = .344). In Step 2, the QMI was the only significant predictor of GMSEX scores (B = .084, p &lt; .001). Thus, participants who reported higher relationship satisfaction also reported higher sexual satisfaction, but sexual fluidity beliefs were not a significant predictor of sexual satisfaction (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Follow-Up Regression Analyses</head><p>Because sexual and relationship satisfaction were so strongly correlated (r = .56 between GMSEX and QMI), follow-up analyses were conducted to better understand predictors of sexual and relationship satisfaction individually. With the QMI removed from the regression predicting GMSEX, significant predictors of GMSEX were partner gender and relationship length. Specifically, participants who were partnered with transgender men reported being more sexually satisfied than other groups, and longer length of relationship was associated with lower sexual satisfaction. Sexual fluidity beliefs did not significantly predict sexual satisfaction, even with QMI removed from the model (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>).</p><p>Given that relationship satisfaction (i.e., QMI) was such a strong predictor of sexual satisfaction, this led to the question of what variables predicted QMI scores. In a regression predicting QMI from control variables, sexual fluidity beliefs, and LGBTQ+ community connectedness, relationship length and LGBTQ+ community connectedness were the only significant predictors. That is, shorter relationship length and higher LGBTQ+ community connectedness each predicted higher relationship satisfaction (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>). Perhaps not surprisingly, when GMSEX was included in the model predicting QMI, it became the only significant predictor (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>). 15.6% of variance in participants' satisfaction relative to before their partner came out (R 2 adjusted = .097). In this case, LGBTQ+ community connectedness was the only significant predictor.</p><p>That is, participants who reported feeling more connected to the LGBTQ+ community also reported higher relationship/sexual satisfaction relative to before their partner came out (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">5</ref>).</p><p>Therefore, the results showed that relationship satisfaction was the strongest predictor of sexual satisfaction among partners of TGNB individuals. In turn, shorter relationship length and higher LGBTQ+ community connectedness each predicted higher relationship satisfaction.</p><p>Among participants whose partners came out during their relationship, higher LGBTQ+ community connectedness was associated with higher relationship/sexual satisfaction relative to before their partner's TGNB identity disclosure. Sexual fluidity beliefs were not significantly associated with relationship or sexual satisfaction when controlling for other variables.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mediation Analysis</head><p>To more fully understand the links between LGBTQ+ community connectedness, relationship satisfaction, and sexual satisfaction, a mediation analysis was conducted using the PROCESS macro for SPSS version 4.2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Hayes, 2022)</ref>. Because higher LGBTQ+ community connectedness predicted higher relationship satisfaction, which in turn predicted higher sexual satisfaction, it was expected that relationship satisfaction might mediate an association between</p><p>LGBTQ+ community connectedness and sexual satisfaction. Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref> shows the results of this mediation analysis, which included partner gender (transgender man or other) and relationship length as covariates. First, the effect of LGBTQ+ community connectedness on relationship satisfaction was significant, b = 2.76, p = .005. Second, the effect of relationship satisfaction on sexual satisfaction was significant, b = 0.08, p &lt; .001. Third, the total effect of LGBTQ+ connectedness on sexual satisfaction approached significance, b = 0.32, p = .052. Finally, when controlling for the mediator of relationship satisfaction, the effect of LGBTQ+ connectedness on sexual satisfaction decreased substantially, b = 0.09, p = .531. A Sobel test (calculated using van den Berg, 2025) indicated that relationship satisfaction fully mediated the association between</p><p>LGBTQ+ community connectedness and sexual satisfaction (indirect effect = 0.23, 95% CI [0.06, 0.41] , z = 2.60, p = .009).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Exploratory Subgroup Analyses</head><p>Due to the relatively homogenous nature of our sample (i.e., primarily white cisgender women), exploratory subgroup analyses were conducted to examine to what extent the patterns found in the full sample were present in subgroups of the sample -people of color (POC) and/or those who did not identify as cisgender women. These subgroup analyses are available in the Supplementary Materials. In general, relationship satisfaction and sexual satisfaction were strongly linked across gender (categorized as cisgender woman or other) and race/ethnicity (categorized as POC or white) subgroups. Additionally, higher LGBTQ+ community connectedness predicted a higher overall Relationship/Sexual Happiness Comparison score in all subgroups with the exception of genders other than cisgender women. Notably, our mediation analysis did not show significant mediation in the subgroup analyses, likely due to low statistical power.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Attention Check</head><p>The overall pattern of results in the primary analyses (i.e., the regression models and mediation model) was very similar when excluding the 14 participants who failed the attention check. The three exceptions were: 1) partner gender reached significance as a predictor of QMI (when GMSEX was not included in the model), with participants partnered with transgender men reporting higher relationship satisfaction relative to other groups; 2) relationship length was no longer statistically significant as a predictor of the overall Relationship/Sexual Happiness Comparison in Step 1 of the model; and 3) the total effect of LGBTQ+ community connectedness on sexual satisfaction reached significance in the mediation model, b = 0.37, p = .034.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>The current study investigated fluidity in sexual identity labels and predictors of sexual satisfaction in partners of TGNB individuals. In our sample predominately composed of cisgender white women, about three quarters of participants reported maintaining the same sexual identity label relative to before their current relationship or before their partner came out as TGNB. Participants who shifted their identity label endorsed stronger sexual fluidity beliefs than those who maintained their label. However, sexual fluidity beliefs did not significantly predict sexual satisfaction. Instead, higher LGBTQ+ community connectedness predicted higher relationship satisfaction, which in turn predicted higher sexual satisfaction.</p><p>These results mirror some past findings suggesting that having a TGNB partner does not necessarily result in a shift in one's sexual identity label <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Platt, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Siboni et al., 2023)</ref>. Having a TGNB partner may affirm an existing identity label for plurisexual individuals or for those whose identity label poses no conflict with their partner's gender identity <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Brown, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Rosner, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Siboni et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Theron &amp; Collier, 2013)</ref>; others may maintain an identity label that is branched with their partner's gender identity <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Aramburu Alegría, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">van Anders, 2015)</ref>. When shifts in identity labels did occur, they most often reflected a shift to a broader sexual identity label (e.g., bisexual to pansexual, gay/lesbian to gay/lesbian and queer), which is also consistent with past research on partners of TGNB individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Platt &amp; Bolland, 2018)</ref>. In general, research on sexual fluidity suggests that broadening of gender/sex target(s) of attractions is more common than narrowing of attractions over the lifespan <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Diamond, 2008)</ref>. Whether this is due to a broadening of attractions themselves, a delay in individuals recognizing some of their attractions (e.g., due to heteronormativity or other factors), or a combination of both remains a fascinating question for future research. Individuals who shifted their identity labels reported higher sexual fluidity beliefs, but whether an individual shifted vs. maintained their identity label did not predict their sexual or relationship satisfaction. Similarly, and contrary to the primary hypothesis, sexual fluidity beliefs did not predict sexual satisfaction, nor did they predict relationship satisfaction after controlling for other variables. This finding may have important implications for therapists or other professionals who counsel couples in trans-inclusive relationships, especially when gender transition occurs during a relationship. That is, it is normative for partners of TGNB individuals to continue identifying with their current label or to shift their label; similarly, partners vary in their fluidity beliefs. However, neither of these factors have clear implications for relationship or sexual satisfaction. Transgender individuals and their partners may find the language of "branched" and "coincident" from Sexual Configurations Theory useful in understanding that someone's relationship status may or may not reflect their sexual identity <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(van Anders, 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Similarly, it may be reassuring for those in trans-inclusive relationships (particularly those who believe their sexuality is less fluid) to know that variation in fluidity beliefs does not clearly translate to variation in relationship and sexual satisfaction.</p><p>The finding that sexual fluidity beliefs did not predict sexual satisfaction was unexpected, given that prior qualitative research had suggested that non-fluid individuals expressed more concerns about sexual desire for their transgender partner relative to fluid individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Brown, 2010)</ref>. It may be that other factors, such as overall relationship satisfaction or communication quality, are stronger quantitative contributors to sexual satisfaction than fluidity beliefs, as discussed below. Another reason for this null finding could relate to the measure of sexual fluidity beliefs used in this study, which had adequate but not strong internal consistency in our sample. Interestingly, internal consistency for the 5-item Sexual Fluidity Beliefs Scale was lower in our sample than in a past study of young, cisgender sexual minority adults that did not specifically recruit those in trans-inclusive relationships <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Katz-Wise &amp; Hyde, 2015)</ref>. This suggests that the construct of sexual fluidity beliefs itself could be more complex or multidimensional among those with TGNB partners. Further research could examine the reliability and validity of the Sexual Fluidity Beliefs Scale among those in trans-inclusive relationships, specifically whether additional items may be needed to capture fluidity beliefs in this population.</p><p>Although fluidity beliefs did not predict sexual satisfaction, this study was able to identify several predictors of sexual and relationship satisfaction in partners of TGNB individuals. Relationship satisfaction was the strongest predictor of sexual satisfaction (and vice versa), such that those who reported higher satisfaction with their relationship (e.g., feeling like part of a team with their partner) also reported that their sexual relationship with their partner was more satisfying. This finding is not particularly surprising, as a strong link between sexual satisfaction and relationship satisfaction has been shown in past research <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Byers, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Calvillo et al., 2020b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">del Mar Sánchez-Fuentes &amp; Sierra, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Fallis et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Fleishman et al., 2020)</ref>, although to the author's knowledge this study is the first to focus on this link in partners of TGNB individuals. Past research with primarily cisgender heterosexual couples suggests that communication -both sexual and nonsexual -is an important aspect of this link <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Byers, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Mark &amp; Jozkowski, 2013)</ref>. That is, couples who were more satisfied with their relationship reported higher quality sexual and nonsexual communication, translating to higher sexual satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Mark &amp; Jozkowski, 2013)</ref>. In a qualitative study about sexual satisfaction in transmasculine and nonbinary individuals, participants discussed how a partner's ability to understand their gender identity and respect boundaries around their bodies -elements inherently tied to communication -promoted sexual satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Lindley et al., 2021)</ref>. Future studies should consider measuring sexual and nonsexual communication quality quantitatively among both partners in trans-inclusive relationships, as high-quality communication may be especially important for partners navigating the social and physical changes associated with gender transition together.</p><p>In turn, when exploring predictors of relationship satisfaction, shorter relationship length and higher LGBTQ+ community connectedness each predicted higher relationship satisfaction.</p><p>Negative links between relationship length and relationship (or sexual) satisfaction have been demonstrated in multiple past studies not specific to trans-inclusive relationships <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bühler et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bühler &amp; Orth, 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">del Mar Sánchez-Fuentes &amp; Sierra, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Kurdek, 1999)</ref>, particularly during the first 10 years of a relationship. This may reflect life stressors that couples encounter as relationships age (e.g., transition to parenthood) or the conclusion of the "honeymoon" phase of a relationship <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bühler et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bühler &amp; Orth, 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Kurdek, 1999)</ref>.</p><p>In trans-inclusive relationships specifically, past research has demonstrated that longer length of time in a relationship prior to a partner's gender transition is negatively associated with relationship satisfaction among cisgender women, potentially because transition requires a greater adjustment in this case <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Platt, 2020)</ref>. Thus, the negative association between relationship length and satisfaction in the current study could reflect both general patterns expected in committed relationships and factors specific to trans-inclusive relationships.</p><p>When considering a measure of overall satisfaction (relationship and sexual) compared to before a partner came out, participants with higher connectedness to the LGBTQ+ community were more likely to report that their satisfaction with their relationship and sexual intimacy increased. Additionally, relationship satisfaction fully mediated the effect of LGBTQ+ community connectedness on sexual satisfaction. LGBTQ+ community connectedness may facilitate relationship well-being for partners of TGNB individuals by providing examples of other relationships like theirs or offering opportunities for concrete support for questions about navigating co-transition. These effects on relationship well-being may then translate to positive effects on sexual satisfaction. In past qualitative studies, some partners of TGNB individuals reported experiences of growth through engaging in advocacy for the transgender community <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Gunby &amp; Butler, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Platt &amp; Bolland, 2018)</ref>. Importantly, some prior studies suggest that</p><p>LGBTQ+ community connectedness may be lacking for some partners of TGNB individuals, either because their relationship can appear straight or because not all partners identify as</p><p>LGBTQ+ themselves <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Joslin-Roher &amp; Wheeler, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Platt &amp; Bolland, 2018)</ref>. This study suggests that efforts to help partners of TGNB individuals feel connected to the LGBTQ+ community may benefit their relationships. Future studies could explore what types of LGBTQ+ community engagement, such as in-person or online support groups, participating in Pride events, political or social activism, or more informal connections such as friendships, are most beneficial for partners of TGNB individuals.</p><p>The findings point to both general and unique factors predicting sexual and relationship satisfaction in partners of TGNB individuals. In some ways, relationships including a TGNB partner are very similar to other relationship types studied, in that those who are more satisfied with their relationship report being more satisfied with sexual intimacy. The current study also identified a more specific factor, LGBTQ+ community connectedness, that predicted satisfaction. These findings mirror past research suggesting that both general factors -lower sexual anxiety, higher body image, and higher relationship commitment -and the specific factor of higher</p><p>LGB+ identity pride -predicted stronger sexual satisfaction among LGB+ individuals in relationships <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Shepler et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>The current study helps fill a gap in quantitative research on satisfaction among partners of TGNB individuals. Until relatively recently, much of the focus on trans-inclusive relationships, both in research and in popular culture, has been on whether a relationship can "survive" gender transition (see St. <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Amand et al., 2013</ref> for a discussion). Perhaps instead researchers should be asking -what factors contribute to a relationship thriving during cotransition? One important finding of this study is that the majority of participants reported being just as happy or happier in their relationship compared with before their partner disclosed their TGNB identity. Of course, it is likely that participants who are struggling in their relationships or whose relationships have dissolved are less likely to participate in research on this topic. It is important to remember that co-transition occurs against the backdrop of other dynamics, changes, and stressors in a relationship<ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">2</ref> ; indeed, some past research suggests that when transinclusive couples made the decision to separate, gender transition was cited as the primary reason only about half the time (St. <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Amand et al., 2013)</ref>. This research adds to a growing body of studies suggesting that, while the very real challenges associated with co-transition should not be minimized, the potential for positive outcomes and satisfaction among partners of TGNB individuals should not be ignored <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Gunby &amp; Butler, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Marshall et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>This study has several limitations that are important to acknowledge. The sample was primarily composed of white cisgender women, such that the experiences of those navigating a trans-inclusive relationship alongside a marginalized racial or ethnic identity, as well as those who are male, nonbinary, and/or transgender themselves, are under-represented. In particular, future research is needed to evaluate whether LGBTQ+ community connectedness would remain an important predictor of relationship satisfaction in a more diverse sample. Prior research showed that Black, Latino, and white participants reported similar levels of LGBTQ+ community connectedness on the measure used in the current study <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Frost &amp; Meyer, 2012</ref>). Yet, some Black sexual minority individuals report that social support for their racial or religious identity may come at the expense of support for their sexual orientation or relationship and vice versa (reviewed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Tornello, 2021)</ref>, and queer POC often experience racism from white</p><p>LGBTQ+ communities <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Cyrus, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Han, 2007)</ref>. Among Black LGBTQ+ individuals, belongingness to the Black community was linked with better mental health, and belongingness to the Black LGBTQ+ community specifically was linked with better subjective well-being <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Watts &amp; Thrasher, 2024)</ref>. Therefore, future research is needed to determine whether connectedness to intersectional LGBTQ+ POC communities, rather than LGBTQ+ community connectedness generally, might predict higher relationship satisfaction among POC in transinclusive relationships. Notably, there are few studies on experiences of trans-inclusive relationships among cisgender men or POC outside of a sexual risk focus. In an important exception, Gamarel and colleagues' (2014) findings point to the importance of external stressors (i.e., financial hardship, relationship stigma) in predicting relationship quality among cisgender men and their transgender women partners in a primarily POC sample. A limitation of the current study's recruitment strategy was the reliance on online support spaces, which perhaps are more likely to include white cisgender women; future studies should employ a more intentional recruitment strategy (e.g., reaching out to community organizations that center queer POC).      For participant transgender identity, 1 = yes (i.e., participant self-identifies as transgender), 0 = no. Partner gender variables are coded similarly to participant gender variables. For disclosure timing, 1 = at the beginning of the relationship, 0 = during the relationship. B = unstandardized beta.   </p></div>

Because these items required participants to compare their current experience to their experience before their partner's gender identity disclosure, this analysis included only participants whose partner came out during their relationship. The full model, which included control variables, sexual fluidity beliefs, and LGBTQ+ community connectedness, explained</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_2"><head>Future</head><label></label><figDesc>research could use dyadic, longitudinal designs to investigate questions of directionality as well as variables unaddressed by the current study. For example, longitudinal studies could examine communication as a predictor of relationship and sexual satisfaction among both partners in trans-inclusive relationships. Longitudinal research could also help clarify how a partner's understanding of their sexual identity and sexual fluidity shift at various stages of a TGNB partner's transition. Research should also examine how factors less specific to gender identity and transition, such as the transition to parenthood or sexual desire discrepancy, influence sexual and relationship satisfaction in trans-inclusive relationships. This study of sexual fluidity and sexual satisfaction in partners of TGNB individuals demonstrated evidence for both stability and change in the sexual identity labels used by participants. Contrary to predictions, sexual fluidity beliefs were not an important predictor of sexual satisfaction among partners of TGNB individuals. Instead, higher LGBTQ+ community connectedness predicted higher relationship satisfaction, which in turn predicted higher sexual satisfaction. The findings point to the ways in which relationships including a TGNB partner show similar patterns to those identified in other types of relationships, as well as highlight the importance of LGBTQ+ community connectedness for well-being in partners of TGNB individuals.</figDesc></figure>

These differences could be highly meaningful, such that much is lost by combining all POC or all genders besides cis women together; however, statistical power is too low to address these questions in our sample.</p></div>			</div>
