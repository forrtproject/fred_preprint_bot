<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The current study examined the effectiveness of digital interventions for enhancing empathy in adults. We conducted a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of interventions compared with non-specific (i.e., not intended to be therapeutic) and active control conditions (i.e., intended to be therapeutic). Across 24 studies, including 26 comparisons (n = 3,137), the overall estimated effect size was statistically significant (g = 0.19, 95% CI [0.05, 0.32], p = .006). However, when accounting for publication bias using trim-and-fill analysis, the estimated effect size became smaller and non-significant (g = 0.07, 95% CI [-0.07, 0.22], p = .322). Studies with follow-up data were analyzed separately (k = 6), yielding a small effect (g = 0.29, 95% CI [0.07,0.5], p = .008) which was robust to trim-and-fill analysis. No significant moderators were identified. An exploratory analysis of studies separated by control group type revealed a small positive effect for studies with non-specific control groups (g = 0.22, 95% CI [0.12, 0.33], p &lt; .001) which was robust to trim-and-fill analysis. The results suggest there is potential for digital interventions to have a positive impact on enhancement of empathy in adults, although digital interventions do not appear to outperform active control conditions. For digital interventions to most fully deliver on their potential, they may require more advanced technology that can offer attuned interaction that mimics a human relationship, as well as offer feedback to participants.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials</head><p>Broadly conceptualized as the ability to imagine another's perspective and subsequently have a vicarious emotional experience, empathy plays a critical role in human interaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Cuff et al., 2016)</ref>. It underpins healthy and fulfilling relationships with others and with oneself <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(De Paul &amp; Guibert, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Gibb &amp; Abela, 2008)</ref>. Researchers describe empathy as both a trait with a developmental trajectory as well as a state influenced by specific social contexts <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Cuff et al., 2016)</ref>. In addition, empathy can be categorized into cognitive and affective components.</p><p>Cognitive empathy is the recognition of emotion in another <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Gerdes et al., 2010)</ref> and can be understood as a top-down process that involves producing a working model of others' emotional states based on visual, auditory, and context clues and thus requires holding and employing information within the working memory <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Decety &amp; Meyer, 2008)</ref>. In contrast to cognitive empathy, affective empathy is a bottom-up process of experiencing another's emotions oneself and responding with an appropriate emotion <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Cuff et al., 2016)</ref>. Empathy can also have a behavioral component (i.e., outward expressions of empathy; <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Overgaauw et al., 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Empathy is important for individuals, relationships, and society. Evidence overwhelmingly suggests that increases in empathy lead to higher quality of life, healthy and positive relationships, and improved well-being <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Morelli et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Vinayak &amp; Judge, 2018)</ref>.</p><p>On a societal level, empathy plays a powerful role in the welfare and progress of all communities and cultures <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Decety &amp; Jackson, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Enke, 2023)</ref>. Indeed, the enhancement of empathy has been a focus of many researchers in developmental and educational psychology because it has the power to shape responsible citizenship and societal change within the next generation <ref type="bibr">(Krznaric, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Rigg &amp; van der Wal-Maris, 2020)</ref>. Additionally, empathy in helping professionals such as psychotherapists or physicians is associated with better outcomes for patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Hojat et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Watson et al., 2014)</ref>. Numerous interventions have been created for fostering empathy in children, such as socio-emotional learning curriculums for preschool and elementary school classrooms <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Rosenthal &amp; Gatt, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Schonert-Reichl et al., 2012)</ref>. While considerable research has examined interventions that target empathy in the early stages of life, relatively less attention has been given to interventions that might enhance empathy in adults.</p><p>Interventions that have been studied for enhancing empathy in adults have taken various forms, the most common of which have consisted of in-person trainings that include games, role play, didactics (lectures), demonstrations and practice, interpersonal-process-recall videotapefeedback models, guided meditation, and micro-training (counseling micro-skills trainings; <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Lam et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Teding van Berkhout &amp; Malouff, 2016)</ref>. Research evaluating these empathy trainings indicate that they are generally effective. Indeed, a meta-analysis conducted by Teding van <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Berkhout and Malouff (2016)</ref>  among others that are used with the aim of affecting an outcome or change. Digital interventions may elicit higher engagement and result in more significant and longer-term impact than traditional trainings. For example, in a study that aimed to elicit empathy for the homeless, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Herrera et al. (2018)</ref> found that participants in the VR perspective-taking task had more positive, longer-lasting attitudes toward the homeless and signed a petition supporting the homeless at a significantly higher rate than participants who completed a traditional perspective-taking task. It is likely that the immersive nature of VR, simulation, video game, and computer game platforms provide a more realistic, embodied experience of empathy <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Boltz et al., 2015)</ref>, potentially resulting in more potent impact. Additionally, these types of digital interventions may be more effective because they offer a space that is safe to make mistakes while developing new skills <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Sweigart et al., 2014)</ref>. Moreover, digital interventions are easily scalable, and many are accessible to anyone with an internet connection <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Goldberg et al., 2022)</ref>.</p><p>Despite the promise of digitally delivered empathy training, current findings on the efficacy of digital interventions for empathy are mixed. While many studies of digital interventions show encouraging results for improving mental health <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Linardon et al., 2024)</ref>, some indicate that digital platforms can hinder the impact of an empathy intervention. <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Porcino et al. (2017)</ref>, for example, found that VR can cause motion sickness, disorientation, and other discomfort that mitigated the intervention's effects. Likewise, some video game and simulation interventions indicate that participants end up increasing empathy only for characters with similar identities or backgrounds in comparison to characters of other cultures and identities <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Paiva et al., 2005)</ref>. Some critics also argue that digital interventions are unlikely to be beneficial, as digital culture has reduced social interaction, increased individualism, and decreased empathic responses among younger generations <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Gorry, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Misra et al., 2016)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Present Study</head><p>Given the mixed findings on the efficacy of digital interventions for empathy, the present meta-analysis sought to synthesize the evidence from the available randomized controlled trials (RCTs) testing these interventions. We focused specifically on empathy training in adults, given previous research on empathy predominantly focused on early stages of life and less is known about empathy development later in development <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Rosenthal &amp; Gatt, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Schonert-Reichl et al., 2012)</ref>. Demonstrating that digital interventions have the capacity to increase empathy in adulthood may have important implications for individual, relational, and societal health. We hypothesized that digital interventions would have a positive impact on empathy development in adults.</p><p>In addition to evaluating the overall impact of digital intervention on empathy in adults, we were also interested in factors that may influence the effectiveness of this approach. We examined the following moderators: neurological or psychological disorder, control group types, career type, type of digital interventions, age, dose, deliberate practice or feedback. Specifically, we hypothesized that digital interventions would have a smaller impact on empathy among individuals with conditions associated with impaired empathic capacity (e.g., autism spectrum disorder, traumatic brain injury, antisocial personality disorder, or schizophrenia). We also expected larger effects when interventions were compared to non-specific controls (i.e., comparisons not intended to be therapeutic) vs. active controls (i.e., those intended to be therapeutic; <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Wampold et al., 1997)</ref>, among adults in helping professions vs. other careers, for VR-based interventions compared to other digital formats, for younger vs. older adults, for interventions with higher dosage or longer duration, and when deliberate practice and/or feedback was included.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Protocol and Registration</head><p>The current study was preregistered through the Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/b9ukd?view_only=b70bba762eee4c11ac3528ddd3e79b38) and was conducted based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Moher et al., 2009)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Eligibility Criteria</head><p>The purpose of this meta-analysis was to examine the effectiveness of digital interventions in enhancing empathy in adults. Studies were selected based on the following criteria: a) RCT, b) delivered a digital intervention, c) utilized an empathy outcome measure that included a cognitive, affective, or behavioral component of empathy, or any combination of the three, and d) included an adult population (i.e., samples ≥18 years old, on average). We focused on interventions that were designed to be delivered digitally, such as a VR immersive experience or an interactive smartphone app. Examples of interventions that are digital but were not included in this meta-analysis were video games used purely for entertainment purposes, traditional psychotherapy delivered via telehealth, or a psychoeducational document delivered on an e-reader. The first example is not an intervention, and the latter examples involve a digital component, but the digital aspect of the experience is not central to the intervention's delivery nor its effectiveness. Of note, if a study examined cognitive empathy only, they needed to explicitly name it as "cognitive empathy" rather than "theory of mind" or other terms. Studies with non-digital control conditions were eligible. When statistics used to calculate effect sizes were not included in the published findings, the original study authors were contacted to provide necessary data. There were no geographic, cultural, or publication date restrictions for study inclusion in this meta-analysis. Studies published in English, Spanish, and German were included.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Information Sources</head><p>A systematic literature search was conducted on February 23, 2024 to locate relevant studies that met inclusion criteria. The following databases were searched: PsycINFO, PubMed/Medline, CINAHL Plus with Full Text, Cochrane Trials, Scopus, Web of Science, and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Global. In addition, we utilized the reference lists of previously published meta-analyses (e.g., Teding van Berkhout &amp; Malouff, 2016) to retrieve additional relevant studies. The study was pre-registered prior to conducting the literature search in order to increase the transparency and rigor of the evaluation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Search</head><p>The key terms used for the literature search included: (technology OR digital OR virtual</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>OR internet) AND (intervention OR program OR training OR treatment) AND (mentalizing OR</head><p>"theory of mind" OR "emotion recognition" OR perspective-taking OR "empath*") AND ("random*"). These search terms were developed by considering the most common words used to describe each factor in our research question, such as terms like "mentalizing," which is synonymous with cognitive empathy <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Cerniglia et al., 2019)</ref>. A research librarian was also consulted for best practices in developing an exhaustive list of search terms. In order to reduce publication bias <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Borenstein et al., 2009)</ref>, dissertations and unpublished findings were included in the literature search. Databases were searched since inception.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study Selection</head><p>The first author and one additional coder independently coded all studies for inclusion/exclusion. Coder training included an overview of the coding manual followed by an initial phase of coding a small number of titles/abstracts that we then examined together to discuss discrepancies. After all studies were coded by both coders independently, coders reconvened to discuss any discrepancies. Discrepancies were resolved through discussion and consensus, returning to original articles when indicated and consulting with the senior author as needed. Interrater reliabilities for inclusion at title and/or abstract and full text levels were good to excellent (i.e., ICC ≥ 0.60; Cicchetti, 1994).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Collection Process</head><p>Standardized spreadsheets were used to record study characteristics and effect size information for each of the trials. Data were independently extracted by the first author and a second coder. Studies were excluded if they were still recruiting participants or if authors did not respond when contacted regarding availability of data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Items</head><p>All the studies included in this meta-analysis were intervention studies. Pre-and post-test means and standard deviations from the intervention and control groups were utilized to derive between-group effect sizes. For studies that provided post-test outcome data only (missing baseline data), we compared the groups at post-test. When baseline ns were not reported, we used post-test ns.</p><p>Several continuous and categorical variables were coded for descriptive purposes and for moderator testing. Included studies were coded on characteristics of the study and study design, (i.e., autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia, traumatic brain injury, antisocial personality disorder, or none), e) career type (i.e., whether or not the participants had a career in healthcare or education), f) stage of career (e.g., trainee vs non-trainee), and g) country of origin.</p><p>Characteristics of the intervention included: a) group vs. individual delivery, b) type of digital intervention (i.e., VR, video game, simulation, online module(s), smartphone app, other), c) whether the intervention was delivered in combination with human support (e.g., smartphone application + in-person exercises), d) comparison condition or control group type (i.e., active vs. non-specific; <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Wampold et al., 1997)</ref>, f) dosage (i.e., hours), and g) whether the intervention included deliberate practice or feedback.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary Measures</head><p>As the studies included in this meta-analysis were all RCTs of interventions, effect sizes were calculated as <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Becker's ∆ (1988)</ref>, defined as the difference between within-group standardized mean differences (i.e., Cohen's d). For studies that did not report Cohen's d, preand post-test means and standard deviations were used to calculate it <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Cohen, 1988</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Becker's (1988)</ref> ∆ accounts for potential baseline differences rather than relying exclusively on betweengroup differences at post-test. The formulas that were utilized to make these calculations with pre-and post-test means and standard deviations are listed below: <ref type="formula">1</ref>) <ref type="formula">2</ref>)</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">𝑑 𝑤𝑖𝑡ℎ𝑖𝑛 = 𝑀 𝑝𝑟𝑒 -𝑀 𝑝𝑟𝑒 𝑆𝐷 𝑝𝑜𝑜𝑙𝑒𝑑 (Equation</formula><formula xml:id="formula_1">𝑣𝑎𝑟 (𝑑 𝑤𝑖𝑡ℎ𝑖𝑛 ) = ( 1 𝑛 + 𝑑 2 2𝑛 ) × 2(1 -𝑟) (Equation</formula><p>If the included studies did not report r (the correlation between pre-and post-scores), a correlation of rxx = .50 was assumed between time points <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Hoyt &amp; Del Re, 2018)</ref>. It is also important to note that the pooled SD in the denominator of the above equation is from pretreatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Becker, 1988)</ref>.</p><p>In order to account for the upward bias of Cohen's d (an overestimation of the absolute value of standardized mean difference in smaller samples), d values were converted to Hedge's g using correction factor J <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Borenstein et al., 2009)</ref>. The between-group effect size for the difference between the digital intervention and control groups was then calculated using</p><p>Becker's ∆ (1988): <ref type="formula">3</ref>) <ref type="formula">4</ref>) Superscript T refers to the digital intervention and C refers to comparison condition. The</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">Δ = 𝑔 𝑤𝑖𝑡ℎ𝑖𝑛- 𝑇 𝑔 𝑤𝑖𝑡ℎ𝑖𝑛 𝐶 (Equation</formula><formula xml:id="formula_3">var(Δ) = 𝑣𝑎𝑟(𝑔 𝑤𝑖𝑡ℎ𝑖𝑛 𝑇 ) + 𝑣𝑎𝑟(𝑔 𝑤𝑖𝑡ℎ𝑖𝑛 𝐶 ) (Equation</formula><p>Becker's Δ formula can be reversed, so it is important to note the order (Treatment -Control) for interpretational implications. In this case, a positive value will favor Treatment, and a negative value favors Control. For each reported effect size in each study included in this meta-analysis, calculations were completed using the 'metafor' <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Viechtbauer, 2010)</ref> and 'MAd' packages in R <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Del Re &amp; Hoyt, 2014)</ref>. A random-effects model was used, with effect sizes weighted based on estimates of both within-study and between-study variance. For studies that measured cognitive and affective empathy outcomes separately, we combined them into a single value. Effects at follow up time points were analyzed separately, when available.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Moderator Analysis</head><p>We hypothesized that various factors (e.g., neurological or psychological disorder, career type, type of digital intervention, etc.) may influence the impact of digital interventions on empathy in adults. We examined both continuous (e.g., age of participants) or categorical (e.g., type of profession, type of digital intervention) moderators using meta-regression methods implemented in the 'metafor' package in R <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Viechtbauer, 2010)</ref>. Continuous moderators included age and treatment length (in weeks). Categorical moderators included presence of a neurological or psychological disorder, control group type, career type, deliberate practice or feedback, and type of digital intervention. These moderators were dummy coded and included as predictors in the meta-regression.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Synthesis of Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Aggregation of Effect Sizes within Studies</head><p>As some studies reported multiple effect sizes that corresponded to different measures of empathy, aggregation at the study level was necessary. After calculating Becker's Δ, as described above, all dependent effect sizes within a given study were aggregated using the 'MAd' package <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Del Re &amp; Hoyt, 2018)</ref>, in accordance with <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Hunter &amp; Schmidt's (2004)</ref> recommendations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Tests of Heterogeneity</head><p>The variability of the effect sizes was examined using a heterogeneity test to determine if variability is greater than what would be expected by chance. Specifically, we examined the Q and I 2 statistics. The Q statistic was used to test whether the observed between-study variability was greater than would be expected by chance alone <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Borenstein et al., 2009)</ref>. The I 2 was calculated to determine what percentage of the observed variance reflects actual differences among studies beyond the effects of random error <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Borenstein et al., 2009)</ref>. The extent of heterogeneity can be interpreted based on <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Higgins and Thompson's (2002)</ref> guidelines: 25-49% is small, 50-74% is medium, and 75-100% is a large amount of heterogeneity. A significant Q or an I 2 in the medium, or large range indicates that variation from the true effect size may be due to (measured or unmeasured) moderating variables.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Assessment of Reporting Bias</head><p>Studies with significant results tend to be published more so than studies with less significant results <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Borenstein et al., 2009)</ref>, which ultimately influences results of meta-analyses if not accounted for with assessment of reporting bias. The most effective way to reduce bias is to perform a comprehensive and exhaustive literature search. In addition, we examined the impact of potential publication bias using the trim-and-fill procedure <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Duval and Tweedie, 2000)</ref>.</p><p>Trim-and-fill analysis may be adequate for assessing publication bias, but if a meta-analysis has high heterogeneity, trim-and-fill's ability to correct for bias may be limited <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Carter et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Terrin et al., 2003)</ref>. Moreover, trim-and-fill analyses are based on a fixed effects model, rather</p><p>than the random effects model we used. Thus, trim-and-fill analyses were interpreted cautiously.</p><p>Subsequently, visual inspection of a contour-enhanced funnel plot allowed for more thorough assessment of publication bias. Contour lines added to the funnel plot mark conventional milestones in levels of statistical significance and can aid in discerning if studies are missing in areas of statistical non-significance vs. higher significance. Studies missing in areas of statistical non-significance suggests that asymmetry is due to publication bias, whereas studies missing in areas of higher statistical significance may suggest factors other than publication bias, such as variable study quality <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Peters et al., 2008)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study Selection</head><p>The search yielded 1521 citations. We removed 644 duplicates and evaluated the remaining 877 studies' titles and abstracts based on the inclusion criteria. This evaluation resulted in 184 studies eligible for full-text review (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). After screening with inclusion and exclusion criteria, 24 studies were retained, representing 3,137 participants. Two of the citations <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Hattink et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Silveira et al., 2023)</ref> each included two studies within their publication, resulting in a total of 26 comparisons included in the meta-analysis.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Effectiveness of Digital Interventions on Empathy</head><p>The overall estimated effect size (g = 0.19, 95% CI [0.05, 0.32]) was statistically significant (p = .006), indicating that digital interventions have a small positive effect on empathy in adults on average (see Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> for forest plot). However, when accounting for publication bias using trim-and-fill adjustment, the estimated effect size became smaller (g = 0.07, 95% CI [-0.07, 0.22]) and non-significant (p = .322; see Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> for funnel plot depicting results of trim-and-fill adjustment and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> for color contoured funnel plot). Specifically, the trim-and-fill analysis indicated an under-representation of studies with larger standard errors (i.e., smaller studies) showing non-significant results, which suggests that the initial positive effect size might have been inflated due to publication bias (i.e., publishing smaller studies with disproportionately positive results). Additionally, heterogeneity was quite high both before <ref type="bibr">(67.84% [95% CI 48.33,</ref><ref type="bibr">85.80]</ref>) and after trim-and-fill analysis (76.06%, [95% CI <ref type="bibr">[63.11, 88.14]</ref>), indicating the presence of unexplained variability between studies. Studies with followup data were analyzed separately (k = 6) and a small effect was found (g = 0.29, 95% CI [0.07,0.5], p = .008). This effect was robust to trim-and-fill analysis and no missing studies were imputed, though trim-and-fill was likely underpowered due to the small number of studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Duval &amp; Tweedie, 2000)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Moderator Tests</head><p>The moderators evaluated in this meta-analysis included age, diagnosis, career type (e.g., healthcare professional), dose (i.e., treatment length), deliberate practice or feedback, control group type (i.e., active vs. non-specific), and type of digital intervention (e.g., VR). Contrary to our hypotheses, no significant moderators were identified, (see Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">2</ref> and<ref type="table">3</ref> for moderator test results).</p></div>

This analysis revealed a small positive effect for studies with non-specific control groups (k = 16, g = 0.22, 95% CI [0.12, 0.33], p &lt; .001), and it was robust to publication bias.</p><p>After trim-and-fill analysis where one study was imputed below the omnibus effect, the effect remained significant (g = 0.21, 95% CI [0.1, 0.32], p &lt; 0.001).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary of Findings</head><p>The development of digital interventions for improving the psychosocial skill of empathy is a recently emerging area of scientific interest. We examined 24 RCTs (26 comparisons; n = 3,137) comparing digital interventions with non-digital control conditions. Results indicated a small, positive effect of digital interventions on enhancing empathy in adults (g = 0.19, 95% CI [0.05, 0.32], p = .006), though once publication bias was taken into account, this result was rendered non-significant. Interestingly, when examining studies with follow-up data separately (k = 6), a small effect was found (g = 0.29, 95% CI [0.07, 0.5], p = .008) that was robust to publication bias, although trim-and-fill adjustment was likely underpowered. Additionally, a small effect was found for studies with non-specific control groups (g = 0.22, 95% CI [0.12, 0.33], p &lt; .001), although this was an exploratory analysis and was not a preregistered primary analysis. These findings raise several questions regarding the relationship between digital interventions and empathy in adults.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Empathy May Require Human-Supported Interventions</head><p>The modest results from the current study contrast with a recent meta-analysis demonstrating the effects of various interventions in enhancing empathy, with the majority of studies focusing on traditional, non-digital approaches (g = 0.63, p &lt; .001; Teding van Berkhout &amp; Malouff, 2016). Our results may indicate that empathy training is not particularly wellsupported by digital platforms. Empathy skills may be distinct from the types of skills that are successfully supported by digital platforms, such as mindfulness skills <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Linardon et al., 2024)</ref>, symptom tracking skills for addressing mental and physical health concerns <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Serre et al., 2023)</ref>, and language learning skills <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Lee &amp; Borah, 2020)</ref>. Empathy is a non-self-focused skill that requires understanding and connecting with the emotions of others <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Cuff et al., 2016)</ref>. Given the organic development of empathy that occurs in the context of human relationships <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Davidov et al., 2013)</ref>, it could be unrealistic to expect engaging with a digital platform to be an adequate surrogate for producing empathy.</p><p>Another important difference between empathy and other skills that are supported by digital interventions is that empathy may be more emotionally demanding <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Casey et al., 2013)</ref>.</p><p>Willingness to tap into the perspective and emotional experience of another, particularly if the other is going through something emotionally challenging, requires vulnerability to experiencing distress oneself. In fact, it is often the goal of empathy to join someone in their pain <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Jankowiak-Siuda et al., 2011)</ref>. Other skills such as relaxation skills for anxiety or behavioral activation for depression do not require taking on others' pain in addition to one's own. Given the emotional labor involved in empathy, emotion regulation skills may be an essential pre-requisite that allows one to manage personal distress while remaining connected to the other <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Gerdes et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Decety and Jackson, 2004)</ref>. If an individual lacks emotion regulation skills, empathizing with others can be potentially dangerous, which is one reason many people are instinctively limited in their willingness to empathize <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">(Wood et al., 1990)</ref>. Moreover, the amount of exposure one has to giving and receiving empathy in relationships throughout one's life is associated with the strength of one's own empathic capacity <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Stern et al., 2024)</ref>. This highlights another distinction between empathy skills and fitness, language, mindfulness, or mental health symptom reduction skills; the latter skills do not require a reservoir of specific emotional experiences from which the skill can grow. Digital interventions, which oftentimes have more modest effects than humandelivered interventions (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Linardon et al., 2024)</ref>, may simply not be potent enough to compensate for these influential developmental processes. It is possible that the development of empathy may be better supported by human-delivered interventions or a blend of digital interventions with human support, which can provide more personalized guidance, attunement to non-verbal communication <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Turkle, 2011)</ref>, and offer genuine connection.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Technological Limitations May Restrict the Effectiveness of Digital Interventions on</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Empathy</head><p>Conversely, the non-significant trim-and-fill adjusted effect size of the current study might indicate that digital interventions are simply limited by the current technology available.</p><p>The analysis of studies with follow-up data had a small but significant effect (g = 0.29, p = .008) as well as an exploratory analysis of studies with non-specific control groups (g = 0.22, p &lt;</p><p>.001), both of which were robust to publication bias. While these effects are small, they suggest that digital interventions may be effective in the longer term and relative to non-specific control groups. Another meta-analysis, which focused on VR interventions specifically <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Martingano et al., 2021)</ref>, compared baseline empathy (pre-test or control condition) to empathy levels following a VR experience and found that VR was effective (d = 0.44, 95% CI [0.23,0.66], p = &lt;.001). Although we did not find that intervention type moderated effects in the current metaanalysis, Martingano et al.'s findings and the current study's small but significant findings for subsets of studies suggest that some digital interventions may still hold promise for enhancing empathy in adults.</p><p>As evidenced by <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Martingano et al.'s (2021)</ref> study, VR may be promising as an approach for enhancing empathy, although it is noteworthy that VR ultimately was no more effective than traditional interventions <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Martingano et al., 2021)</ref>. Research regarding VR's effectiveness for fostering empathy is still in its early stages and findings are mixed overall <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Martingano et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Porcino et al., 2017)</ref>, which is also reflected in the lack of a significant effect for VR as a treatment type in the current study's moderator analysis. It may be important to explore alternative answers to the question of what type of technology could be more effective, to replace or pair with VR, for an empathy-focused digital intervention.</p><p>One answer proposed by psychotherapy researchers who examine interventions for psychosocial skills training is that interactive capability may be what is missing from current digital interventions <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Imel et al., 2019)</ref>. Machine learning technology that can process participants' language and facial expressions and respond appropriately in real time may hold the most promise for cultivating a deeply human trait and skill such as empathy <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Creed et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Imel et al., 2019)</ref>. Machine learning tools for psychotherapy training are in their infancy but thus far have demonstrated an impressive ability to identify meaningful verbalizations relevant to expressing empathy in the context of counseling <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Kuo et al., 2023)</ref>. There are, of course, rapid advances occurring in this area in recent years through the use of large language models (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Hume AI, 2025)</ref>. Interactive technology that can detect the subtleties and nuances of human expression may be able to mimic a real interaction and subsequently elicit more genuine empathy.</p><p>Another question that the current findings raise is whether digital interventions might be more effective if they incorporated a feedback component. Several of the studies included in this meta-analysis incorporated practice of an interaction (e.g., a medical professional practicing demonstrating empathy in a conversation with a simulated patient; <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Deladisma et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Juan, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Kaltman et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Maggio et al., 2024)</ref>, however, only one study included feedback in response to the practice as part of the intervention model <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Kaltman et al., 2018)</ref>. In psychotherapy research, RCTs of deliberate practice (i.e., focused, goal-oriented skill repetition with feedback) interventions have been shown to improve interpersonal skills <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Larsson et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Olsson et al., 2024)</ref>. Additionally, Teding van Berkhout and Malouff (2016) found that use of behavioral skills training principles (instruction, modeling, practice, and feedback) was a moderator with slightly higher effect sizes than other studies. Feedback regarding demonstrations of empathy is likely a critical yet absent component from the interventions in the current metaanalysis. Advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence may well be able to provide the kind of feedback that is helpful for learning empathy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations of the Current Study</head><p>One limitation inherent in the process of conducting a meta-analysis is the limited amount of published literature available to include in our examination. As there were only 24 studies that met inclusion criteria, the moderator analyses may have been underpowered to detect small effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Hedges &amp; Pigott, 2004)</ref>. Additionally, authors did not consistently report potential moderators of interest, including mean age, which limited our ability to test them as predictors of effectiveness of treatment. Some publication bias assessments (e.g., for effects at follow up)</p><p>were very likely underpowered <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Duval &amp; Tweedie, 2000)</ref>.</p><p>Another limitation is that empathy continues to be inconsistently operationalized and measured across studies which makes it difficult to compare findings with confidence. Most of the included studies only used self-report measures to assess how well participants felt they had managed to take on the perspective or the emotions of another, which operationalizes empathy as primarily an internal experience without a behavioral component. Other studies focused more on participants' ability to demonstrate empathy behaviorally, classifying empathy as a skill.</p><p>Variability in how empathy is conceptualized across intervention studies is a significant limitation to empathy development research.</p><p>Finally, self-report measures, which are at higher risk of inaccuracy than objective measures due to response bias and subjectivity, were utilized exclusively by most studies included in this meta-analysis. Teding van Berkhout and Malouff (2016) along with previous, unpublished meta-analyses <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Butters, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Reed, 1996)</ref>, found that changes in empathy tended to be larger when objective measures were used compared to self-report measures. In the current meta-analysis, there were too few studies that utilized an objective measure to conduct an exploratory moderator analysis on this characteristic.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions and Future Research Directions</head><p>The psychosocial trait and skill of empathy is foundational to human relationships and functioning communities <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(De Paul &amp; Guibert, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Gibb &amp; Abela, 2008)</ref> investment and investigation given their scalability, accessibility, and cost-effectiveness <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Goldberg et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Linardon et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Linardon et al., 2025)</ref>. Ideally future studies will investigate machine learning technology that allows for interactive experiences, tracking of verbal and non-verbal communication (e.g., facial expressions), as well as an ability to offer feedback. The most effective yet still scalable intervention for empathy may reveal itself to be a blend of digital and human-delivered support, considering the complex and relationship-based conditions typically required in traditional or organic contexts for empathy development. Next steps for research on digital interventions for enhancing empathy in adults will hopefully involve larger, higher-powered studies, an opportunity for deliberate practice and feedback, a combination of self-report and objective, behavioral measures of empathy, and interactive artificial intelligence components.

The results showed a medium magnitude effect (g = 0.63) favoring empathy training over controls. While it is established that traditional empathy trainings are effective, the efficacy, scalability, and accessibility of these interventions are limited by lack of immersive features and practical barriers such as cost, the need for physical transportation, and limited resource availability. Digital interventions have the potential to enhance the efficacy, scalability and accessibility of empathy trainings.
