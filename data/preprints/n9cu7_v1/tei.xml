<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Development and Validation of the Goal Dimensions Questionnaire</head><p>Goals such as "losing weight" or "getting an A in the math exam" are desired future states that people are committed to approach or avoid <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Fishbach &amp; Ferguson, 2007)</ref>. They satisfy basic needs <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Brunstein et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">McClelland, 1985</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">McClelland, , 1990))</ref>, express personality <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Dweck, 2017)</ref>, and foster central elements of our lives, including social relationships <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Gable, 2006)</ref>, and well-being <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Brunstein, 1993)</ref>. Importantly, the extent to which a certain goal is capable of supporting people's effort to reach desired outcomes depends on different characteristics, or dimensions, of goals <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Austin &amp; Vancouver, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Fujita &amp; MacGregor, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b108">Milyavskaya &amp; Werner, 2018)</ref>. These goal dimensions are central to different motivational theories that highlight, for example, the relevance of goal specificity and challenge for goal attainment (goal setting theory; <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Locke &amp; Latham, 2002)</ref> or the relevance of goal progress for affect and self-regulatory processes (control theory; <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Carver &amp; Scheier, 1998)</ref>.</p><p>In the past, research considered a wide range of goal dimensions <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Emmons, 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Karoly &amp; Ruehlman, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Klinger et al., 1981;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Little, 1983)</ref>. However, a recent review revealed various problems with their measurement. For example, various different items were used to measure overlapping goal dimensions, but in other cases, the same items were used to capture conceptually distinct goal dimensions, practices known to lead to jingle and jangle fallacies <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Kiendl &amp; Hennecke, 2022</ref>, see explanation below). To address the lack of a comprehensive and construct-validated taxonomy, the aim of the research described in this paper was to develop a questionnaire for the assessment of commonly measured goal dimensions, the Goal Dimensions Questionnaire (GDQ). The GDQ uses items previously used in the goal dimension literature (based on <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Kiendl &amp; Hennecke, 2022)</ref>. We test its structural validity by exploratory (Study 1) and confirmatory (Study 2) factor analysis, and its predictive validity based on two longitudinal studies in which it was used to predict indicators of successful goal pursuit (Study 3) and subjective well-being (Study 4).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Goals and Goal Dimensions</head><p>The ideographic-nomothetic approach is a common method for investigating goal dimensions (also referred to as "goal cognitions," e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Karoly &amp; Ruehlman, 1995</ref><ref type="bibr">, "goal characteristics," e.g., Milyavskaya &amp; Werner, 2018</ref><ref type="bibr">, or "goal appraisals," e.g., Salmela-Aro et al., 2014)</ref>. In this approach, participants first name their goals, such as "losing weight" or "getting an A on the math exam". This first and idiographic part can refer to different goal concepts, such as "personal projects" <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">(Little, 1983)</ref>, "personal strivings" <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Emmons, 1986)</ref>, or "personal goals" <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Brunstein et al., 1999a)</ref> in different domains, like work, education, or personal life. In the second and nomothetic part, participants evaluate their goals according to the goal dimensions of interest. Here, the same items are used across participants and goals, for example items measuring their goal commitment ("How committed are you to this goal?", <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Koestner et al., 2015)</ref> or progress (e.g., "I have made a lot of progress toward this goal", <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Emmons, 1986)</ref>.</p><p>Subsequently, statistical analyses can test associations between goal dimensions and other variables. Research using this approach has, for example, shown that goal commitment is positively related with goal progress <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">(Monzani et al., 2015)</ref>, consensus on goals between patients and therapists is positively related with the effectiveness of psychotherapy <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Busseri &amp; Tyler, 2004)</ref>, and goal support in romantic relationships is positively related with goal enactment and relationship mood <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Brunstein et al., 1996)</ref>. Accordingly, the assessment of goal dimensions can be helpful in the study of a wide range of motivational variables and processes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Problems in the Measurement of Goal Dimensions</head><p>Unfortunately, there is no consensus on which goal dimensions would constitute a comprehensive assessment of goal characteristics, and, even more critical, there is no consensus on how to measure individual goal dimensions. A review of 693 publications found that in the measurement of goal dimensions, there is a great deal of discordance, with 1,166 different dimensions that have been measured by up to 79 different items per dimension, obscuring the breadth, depth, and hierarchical structure of the dimensions <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Kiendl &amp; Hennecke, 2022)</ref>. Furthermore, the same items have been used to measure different goal dimensions. For example, the item "I can definitely rely on the support of those close to me" measured the support and attainability dimensions (jingle fallacy). At the same time, very different items were used to measure the same goal dimension. For example, the items "How much do you feel you are in control of this goal?" and "How likely do you think it is for this goal to come true?" both measured the control (jangle fallacy). Such unsystematic measurement impedes comparing studies based on their goal dimensions or its items <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Hodson, 2021)</ref>. Moreover, the review reports that 42% of goal dimension items were reported without a reference to item sources, suggesting questionable research practices like the ad-hoc generation of items with unclear validity <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Flake &amp; Fried, 2020)</ref>. Together, these results document problematic measurement practices in goal dimension research, putting the replicability of study results at risk <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">(Lilienfeld &amp; Strother, 2020)</ref>. They demonstrate the need for a comprehensive and validated measure of goal dimensions.</p><p>We aimed to integrate previous goal dimension measures and improve future measurements by providing validated scales. Future research may benefit from converging on scales to measure goal dimensions and we suggest using the Goal Dimensions Questionnaire for this purpose.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Present Studies</head><p>The objective of the present studies was to develop the GDQ as a tool to assess commonly measured goal dimensions. A classic road to questionnaire development starts from a construct of interest and derives scales and items that measure it <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Boateng et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Gehlbach &amp; Brinkworth, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b145">Slaney, 2017)</ref>. However, we chose a bottom-up approach because different theories and approaches suggest different goal dimensions as being important, making it subjective to choose one goal dimension over another. Furthermore, there are already theoretically derived measures (for example, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Iwama et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Karoly &amp; Ruehlman, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Little, 1983)</ref>, which, however, usually focus on a (theoretically derived) set of dimensions but neglect others that may also be important for a comprehensive assessment of goals. Developing another top-down measure risks not clarifying but further adding to an already opaque set of goal dimensions and items. Finally, starting from current measures allows for a reorganization of current goal dimension measures, minimizes overlap, and clarifies conceptual borders.</p><p>To address our aim to develop the GDQ, we follow the three recommended phases for providing construct validity evidence of <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Flake et al. (2017)</ref>, namely the substantive, structural, and external phases (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Loevinger, 1957)</ref>. In the substantive phase, the goal dimension scales are defined by using theories and the measure's scope is outlined, including literature reviews, item development, and scaling selection. These aspects are addressed in Study 1. In the structural phase, quantitative analyses determine psychometric properties such as the goal dimension scales' internal consistencies and factor structure. These analyses are addressed in Study 2 and partially already in Study 1. In the external phase, the goal dimensions are associated with other constructs that are expected to be related, including cross-sectional and prospective associations. This is done in Studies 3 and 4.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 1: Exploratory Factor Analysis</head><p>We aimed to develop a parsimonious and comprehensive questionnaire by applying exploratory factor analysis to items measuring common goal dimensions. Exploratory factor analysis is often used to identify underlying dimensions that explain the pattern of correlations among multiple items <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Fabrigar et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Flora &amp; Flake, 2017)</ref>. We base our questionnaire on <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Kiendl and Hennecke's (2022)</ref> review of 693 articles published between January 1970 and June 2020, which have reported measures of goal dimensions. In sum, this review identified as many as 723 different goal dimensions (that is, goal dimensions with different names) and 3,244 partially overlapping items. To use relevant and representative goal dimensions (or at least terms used for what might or might not be different goal dimensions), to meet financial constraints, and to minimize participant burden, we started with 42 common goal dimensions, which were measured in at least ten publications from that time period and for which at least ten item wordings were available. Examples of goal dimensions were absorption by the goal, goal commitment, and goal progress, and the measures varied, for example, in their number of items, item wordings, and response anchors. We used three items to indicate each goal dimension in the final questionnaire to balance parsimony and comprehensiveness within and across goal dimensions.</p><p>Goal concepts vary in abstraction and temporal scope, ranging from abstract, superordinate life goals, such as "have a successful career," to highly specific, subordinate task goals, like "go to the gym on Monday" <ref type="bibr" target="#b154">(Trope &amp; Liberman, 2003)</ref>. The personal goals studied here are at an intermediate level, such as "exercise regularly", which guide behaviour over weeks to years and serve as means to approach superordinate goals <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Brunstein et al., 1999b)</ref>.</p><p>We focused on mid-level goals because task goals are too situation-specific and short-lived to meaningfully vary in goal dimensions (e.g., their value), while highly abstract goals may be too vague and removed from daily behavior. Mid-level goals strike a balance: they are concrete enough to guide action, yet broad enough to carry meaning and purpose <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Emmons, 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">McGregor &amp; Little, 1998)</ref>. Moreover, they encompass other goal concepts used in idiographicnomothetic goal research, making them a suitable foundation for a comprehensive questionnaire <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Kiendl &amp; Hennecke, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b107">Milyavskaya et al., 2022)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>We used the online platform Prolific (www.prolific.com) to recruit 300 participants that currently live in the United Kingdom, have English as first language, and have at least 98 out of 100 possible approval points (indicating compliance in previous surveys). As reported elsewhere, Prolific participants show good performance in data quality tests on attention, comprehension, honesty, and reliability <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Douglas et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b123">Palan &amp; Schitter, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b124">Pe'er et al., 2021)</ref>. We determined the sample sizes of Study 1 and 2 based on recommendations for stable factor analyses <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">(Mundfrom et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b150">Tabachnick &amp; Fidell, 2007)</ref>. From the sample, we excluded twelve participants based on two attention checks and two participants with a relative speed index (RSI) larger than two, resulting in N = 286 participants. The RSI indicates how much faster an individual completes the survey relative to the median completion time <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(Leiner, 2019)</ref>. Participants received £2,25 for participation. They were, on average, 33.9 years old (SD = 12.7). With respect to gender, 203 (71%) identified as female, 78 identified as male, and 5 did not provide gender information.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure</head><p>Participants first read a short summary of the study. They then read a prompt introducing the concept of personal goals to them:</p><p>Goals are projects and concerns that people think about, plan for, carry out, and sometimes (though not always) complete or succeed at. They may be more or less difficult to implement; require only a few or a complex sequence of steps; represent different areas of a person's life; and be more or less time-consuming, attractive, or urgent.</p><p>In this line, goals are intended outcomes a person wants to attain or avoid.</p><p>Further, we are interested in mid-level goals.</p><p>o Mid-level goals are goals that are narrower than abstract value goals or worldviews, which are for example "earning a lot of money" or "establish world peace".</p><p>o Mid-level goals are also broader than concrete task goals, which are for example "clean your bedroom" or "cook for dinner".</p><p>o In terms of time, mid-level goals guide your behavior over extended periods of time ranging from weeks to years.</p><p>Next, we provided examples of personal goals, including "exercise regularly" or "stop smoking". To make participants' goals more salient, they were asked to take one to two minutes to tell us more about their goals, for which we offered leading questions like "What is the outcome that you want to attain, maintain, or avoid?" and "Why have you set this goal"? The full goal prompt for this and the consecutive studies can be accessed in the online supplement.</p><p>Participants then provided a keyword summarizing each of their goals. Each goal dimension item included this keyword (e.g., "How much do you care about achieving your goal "&lt;keyword&gt;"?). The study ended after participants had answered the goal dimension items presented in a randomized order.</p><p>Participants' goals spanned various topics and were classified by a research assistant using the goal domains from <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">Oscarsson et al. (2020)</ref>: work and studies (35%, e.g., "start my master course"), self-improvement (16%, e.g., "learn Latin dance"), physical health (13%, e.g., "maintain my fitness plan"), weight loss (12%), home environment (6%), finances (5%), mental health and sleep (5%), hobbies and interests (2%), friends and family (2%), eating habits (1%), tobacco habits (1%), social engagement (1%), and love (1%).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study Material</head><p>The study was presented via the survey tool SoSciSurvey <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Leiner, 2022)</ref>. Goal dimension items originated from the goal dimension review of <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Kiendl and Hennecke (2022)</ref>.</p><p>Four authors of the current article, who are experts in the fields of motivational psychology and test construction, selected two to three items of 42 common goal dimensions based on how often they were measured, how well their content represented the goal dimension, and on minimal redundancy across items. This led to a selection of 95 items. Note that we did not expect to replicate the large number of 42 goal dimensions, given that these had considerable overlap anyway. Our goal was to reduce this number to a smaller set of goal dimensions. We furthermore transformed items into more general versions if they had previously been used in specific study contexts (e.g., weight loss) and changed problematic items, for example, shortened very long ones or split items that addressed multiple issues. Next, we provided each item with item-specific response options from 0 to 6 that repeated the central element in its response format as recommended by <ref type="bibr" target="#b139">Saris et al. (2010)</ref>. Exemplary items with the goal keyword "stop smoking" are, for goal enjoyment, "How much do you enjoy working on your goal to "stop smoking"?" on a scale from 0 -do not enjoy it at all to 6 -enjoy it very much or for progress "How successful have you been with your goal to "stop smoking" so far?" on a scale from 0 -not at all successful to 6 -very successful.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Exploratory Factor Analysis</head><p>We used the psych-package <ref type="bibr" target="#b160">(Revelle, 2024)</ref> in R (R Core Team, 2020) to determine the number of factors by the "fa.parallel" and the "nfactors"-commands and conducted exploratory factor analyses by the "fa"-command, using minimum residual estimation to extract factors. To ensure appropriate data quality, we conducted the Kaiser-Mayer-Olkin-test to measure sampling adequacy and the Bartlett's test for variance homogeneity. We used oblimin factor rotation to allow for but minimize factor correlations as we expected correlated goal dimensions, for example the enjoyment dimension with the progress dimension, and extracted item loadings by estimating minimal squared residuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Harman &amp; Jones, 1966;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Luo et al., 2019)</ref>. We describe Item loadings ≥ .70 as excellent, ≥ .63 very good, ≥ .55 good, ≥ .45 as fair, and &lt; .45 poor <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Comrey &amp; Lee, 1992)</ref>. Furthermore, considering the diversity of goals and the wide scope of goal dimensions, we describe reliability coefficients α and ω ≥ .90 as excellent, ≥ .80 good, ≥ .70 fair, ≥ .60 acceptable and &lt; .60 questionable <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Dunn et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b105">McNeish, 2018)</ref>. McDonald's omega uses factor loadings and residual variances of the items to estimate the variance that is attributable to the latent goal dimension <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">(McDonald, 1999)</ref>.</p><p>We evaluated factor solutions by their interpretability and by indices that describe the quality of fit between the model and the data. Common model fit indices include the standardized root mean squared residual (SRMR). The SRMR compares the sample covariance matrix to the predicted covariance matrix and indicates misspecifications of the structural model with a recommended cutoff of ≤ .08 <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Hu &amp; Bentler, 1999)</ref> The number of extracted factors had to balance parsimony and fit to the data <ref type="bibr" target="#b127">(Preacher et al., 2013)</ref>. We first used computational approaches to determine the number of underlying factors in the data, on which we then based the factor analysis. The computationally suggested number of factors ranged from eight (a minimum BIC, <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">Raftery, 1995)</ref> to nine (by parallel analysis, <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Horn, 1965)</ref> to twelve factors (Velicers minimum average partial, <ref type="bibr" target="#b155">Velicer, 1976)</ref>.</p><p>Consequently, we conducted factor analyses with eight to twelve factors. All factor solutions showed good model fit according to the SRMR and RMSEA but missed the CFI cutoff. In a next step, we excluded factor solutions that were difficult to interpret or redundant.</p><p>After the exploratory factor analysis procedure, we named the factors based on the items with the highest loadings. We then assigned three items to measure each factor based on expert consensus regarding their relevance to the overall concept, along with high item factor loadings, low item factor cross-loadings, and minimal redundancy with other items. As our aim was to develop a comprehensive measure reflecting broad aspects of common goal dimensions, high loadings were not a strict criterion for inclusion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results and Discussion</head><p>We used exploratory factor analysis to reduce common goal dimension items to factors representing a comprehensive and parsimonious set of goal dimensions. The Kaiser-Mayer-Olkin test was excellent with MSA = .91 <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Kaiser, 1970)</ref> and the Bartlett's test was highly significant K²(94) = 2805, p &lt; .001, indicating the applicability of exploratory factor analysis to the data. The most interpretable solution included nine factors that we termed: expectancy, <ref type="bibr">progress, enjoyment, support, value, external motivation, demand, facilitation, and commitment</ref> (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> for more information). The nine extracted factors explained 47% of the total variability in the data and their structure is described in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. We proceeded with the ninefactor solution due to the overall adequate fit indices and the interpretability of the extracted factors. Note. The term "SS loadings" refers to the sum of squared loadings for each factor. The term "Proportion Var" refers to the proportion of total item variability that is accounted for by the factor. Goal dimensions are sorted in descending order of explained variance.</p><p>It is important to note that the goal external motivation dimension is not the opposite of internal motivation, instead, both motivations can coexist and jointly influence outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b135">(Ryan &amp; Deci, 2020)</ref>. Moreover, the goal enjoyment dimension is related to intrinsic motivation, but is not identical, as it includes both a motivational reason and effective experiences during goal pursuit. To avoid jingle and jangle fallacies, we refer to this factor as goal enjoyment.</p><p>Goal expectancy explained 13% of overall variance, followed by goal progress (8%), followed by goal enjoyment (6%). Together, these dimensions accounted for about half of the variance that could be explained by the entire Goal Dimensions Questionnaire (52%). Given their capacity to explain a large proportion of the variability of commonly used goal dimension measures, the goal expectancy, progress, and enjoyment dimensions may be necessary for comprehensive goal measurement.</p><p>As the factor-analytical approach relies on empirical associations between items, the resulting goal dimensions may differ from previous conceptualizations. For example, the goal commitment scale includes effort, which is not consistently an aspect of goal commitment but an important indicator of it (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Klein et al., 2013)</ref>. Nevertheless, most intercorrelations of factors align with theoretical considerations and expectations. For example, the correlation between goal progress and expectancy may indicate that people base evaluations of their goals' expectancy on their goal progress <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Harkin et al., 2016)</ref>. Moreover, the correlation between goal value and facilitation may suggest that people have auxiliary goals for goals that they highly value <ref type="bibr" target="#b131">(Riediger &amp; Freund, 2004)</ref>.</p><p>All loadings of selected items are listed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>. The means, standard deviations, and correlations of goal dimension scales from the selected items are represented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>. Most goal dimension items had good to excellent factor loadings. Two items that we found to measure commitment had relatively low loadings on the respective factor and loaded comparatively high or somewhat higher on the value and progress factors. However, the item wordings were more consistent with the factor representing goal commitment, that is, actively striving for a goal and being dedicated <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Klein et al., 2013)</ref>. For example, the item "How much effort have you put into your goal "&lt;keyword&gt;"?" is meant to evaluate how hard and consistently someone strives towards a goal, whereas the goal progress factor is indicated by evaluations of current advancement. Similarly, the items selected to measure goal commitment showed crossloadings on the goal value factor but aligned more with goal commitment than with goal value, which indicates personal significance and care. Nevertheless, the observed overlap suggests that future research could consider a higher-order or composite construct of goal importance, encompassing both goal commitment and value, even though this requires further validation. In addition, exploratory factor analysis sequentially extracts factors that only account for a decreasing share of the total variance, resulting in lower item loadings on latter factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Costello &amp; Osborne, 2005)</ref>.

Several theories and studies have proposed that certain goal dimensions should facilitate or hinder successful goal pursuit. Thus, finding associations between the GDQ and measures of successful goal pursuit should provide predictive validity information on the questionnaire <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Flora &amp; Flake, 2017)</ref>. Our aim was not to test existing theories, but to assess whether the identified goal dimensions align with predictions extrapolated from related, though not identical, constructs.

We recruited as many participants as possible via a recruitment booth five to three weeks prior to the exam phase, resulting in a pooled N = 265 participants with a mean age of 22.2 years (SD = 3.28). Of these, 201 participants identified as female and two reported not fitting into these categories. Participants were required to take a graded exam within two to six weeks and were recruited from the Department of Psychology's participant pool and from recruitment booths near two university canteens. Incentives to participate included course credits, snacks, university merchandise, a lottery to win 100€, and personalized feedback after study completion.</p><p>Participants who wanted to participate in the study registered on a study website that provided study information, from which they were directed to the survey platform (formR; <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Arslan et al., 2020)</ref>, and completed the first questionnaire.

At T2, participants again responded to the GDQ regarding their goal. Participants also responded to measures of well-being at both T1 and T2, which are introduced in Study 4. The results of these analyses are presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">17</ref>. At T3, participants reported their subjective satisfaction with their performance on the exam.

In the previous studies, we listed the goal dimensions in the order of factor extraction. However, as we consider all dimensions to be equally important, we hereafter present them in alphabetical order.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Successful Goal Pursuit</head><p>Academic goals referred to individual performance aspirations, so we measured objective and subjective goal attainment and goal progress. Objective goal attainment was measured by asking participants about their received grade with the item "What grade did you receive for the exam of your goal "XYZ" on a 10-point scale from 1 to 4 in increments of 0.3, with "failed" as the extreme anchor (in the German grading system, 1 is very good and 4 is poor but sufficient for passing) in the fourth questionnaire. In the third questionnaire, we measured subjective goal attainment by asking participants "How satisfied are you with your performance on your academic goal "XYZ" (0 = not satisfied at all, 6 = very satisfied). In addition, we used the goal progress dimension from the GDQ at T2 (before the exam) to indicate success in the process along the way. As the construct validity of the goal progress dimension is uncertain at this stage, results involving this dimension as an outcome are reported only in the online supplement. For a critical study on self-reported goal progress measures, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b146">Smyth et al. (2023)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Preregistration</head><p>We preregistered our predictions (OSF; https://osf.io/hsftu). However, the preregistration for this study included predictions about associations between goal dimensions and measures of well-being, which, due to space constraints, we only investigated in Study 4. In the online supplement, we provide correlations of goal dimensions with measures of well-being from Study 3, which are broadly consistent with the results of Study 4. In addition, we planned to explore associations of personality traits and goal dimensions with successful goal pursuit which we have also included in the online supplement. We furthermore preregistered computing models that estimate the effects of goal dimensions on indicators of successful goal pursuit simultaneously. However, the variance in indicators of successful goal pursuit was not sufficient for large models that included all goal dimension predictors at once. We therefore computed zero-order correlations for each combination of goal dimension and outcome: associations of goal dimensions from both goal dimension measurement points with satisfaction with performance and exam grade (36 correlation models), and two cross-sectional (16 correlation models) and cross-lagged (8 correlation models) associations of goal dimensions with the dimension progress. In addition, we controlled the latter cross-lagged associations for the autoregressive effect of goal progress (8 regression models). This resulted in the large number of 68 models.</p><p>We report unadjusted results to account for their unique possible effects. However, because goal dimensions are conceptually and empirically related (see Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> and<ref type="table" target="#tab_9">6</ref>), we also report whether the respective associations fall below a <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Benjamini-Hochberg (1995)</ref> corrected alpha level of statistical significance that accounts for multiple comparisons. The Benjamini-Hochberg correction is based on the Bonferroni correction and modifies the significance threshold for a maximum of 5% false positives in a group of related tests.</p><p>In addition to the preregistered predictions, we also explored the unique and common contributions of goal dimensions for predicting successful goal pursuit by using commonality analyses with the "yhat" package in R <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">(Nimon et al., 2008)</ref>. This analysis partitions the total explained variance (R²) from a multiple regression into the unique and common contributions of all possible predictors <ref type="bibr" target="#b119">(Nimon &amp; Reio, 2011)</ref>. For instance, in a regression of Y on A, B, and C, the overall R² is partitioned into the unique contributions of A, B, and C, as well as the common contributions of all possible combinations (e.g., A and B, B and C, A and C, and A, B, and C).</p><p>Negative common contributions reflect suppressor effects, whereby a goal dimension removes irrelevant variance in the others, thereby enhancing the latter's contribution to the model's overall R² <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">(Nimon &amp; Oswald, 2013)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>We did not categorize the goals of this study because all participants were students pursuing academic goals. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_12">8</ref> illustrates the reliability coefficients α, ω, and retest-reliability as calculated by Pearson-correlations of successive goal dimension measures, which were acceptable to good. The cross-sectional associations of the goal dimensions with each other and their crosslagged associations with satisfaction with performance and exam grade are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_13">9</ref>.</p><p>At both T1 and T2, goal enjoyment, expectancy, and progress were positively and goal demand negatively associated with subjective satisfaction with exam performance at T3 and with objective exam grade reported at T4. These results are partially consistent with our predictions.  Framed results group predicted associations of goal dimensions with indicators of successful goal pursuit and refer each to a group of tests to which we adapt the alpha level. Bold predicted results are significant at the Benjamini-Hochberg-corrected alpha level <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Benjamini &amp; Hochberg, 1995)</ref>.</p><p>The results of the commonality analyses are displayed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_14">10</ref>. Goal expectancy made the largest unique contribution to overall R² in explaining variance in satisfaction with performance at both time points (T1: 34.9%, T2: 13.9%), and accounted for a total of 75.2% at T1 and 66.2% at T2. For exam grade, goal enjoyment made the largest unique contribution at T1 (11.1%), whereas goal value explained the largest unique variance at T2 (17.9%). Across both outcomes, commonality analysis revealed that the goal dimensions significantly associated with successful goal pursuit in bivariate correlations -i.e., goal demand, enjoyment, expectancy, and progress -largely shared their explanatory power with other dimensions. The common contributions of goal dimensions occasionally differed between outcomes and time points. For example, the common contribution of goal demand, expectancy, and progress on the overall R² in predicting satisfaction with performance at T1 was 3.9% and 10.9% at T2, while their common contribution on exam grade was 1.6% at T1 and 4.4% at T2. See the online supplement for a detailed breakdown of shared variance contributions across goal dimensions.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">(Nimon et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b117">Nimon &amp; Oswald, 2013)</ref>. Unique contributions refer to the variance in a dependent variable that is exclusively explained by a goal dimension. Common contributions refer to the variance in a dependent variable that is explained by all possible combinations of goal dimensions that include a specific dimension. The total contributions refer to the sum of the unique and common contributions. Negative common contributions indicate suppression effects of a goal dimension.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>In Study 3, we predicted successful academic goal pursuit related to an upcoming exam, as indicated by satisfaction with one's performance and actual exam grade from the dimensions of the GDQ assessed on two occasions, prior to the exam. The goal progress, expectancy, and enjoyment dimensions were consistently and positively correlated with indicators of successful goal pursuit, whereas goal demand was negatively correlated. These results are consistent with previous research and provide evidence for the construct and predictive validity of the GDQ. We conclude that goal expectancy, enjoyment, demand, and progress most consistently predict goal attainment in self-selected academic goals. Goal commitment, external motivation, facilitation, support, and value may be related to successful goal pursuit in study contexts that are more tailored to their influence.</p><p>Commonality analyses showed a substantial overlap in the predictive power of goal dimensions, as reflected in their common contributions to explained variance in measures of successful goal pursuit. Although these dimensions capture distinct constructs, their predictive effects often run in parallel. For example, if goal expectancy, enjoyment, and progress each positively predict exam grades, they are likely to account for overlapping portions of outcome variance. This shared variance may reflect empirical associations among goal dimensions, even if they operate through different mechanisms.</p><p>Researchers aiming to predict successful goal pursuit parsimoniously may prioritize goal dimensions that account for large unique variance, such as expectancy. Additionally, they may select only one goal dimension from a set of goal dimensions that largely overlap in explanatory contribution. However, the balance of unique and shared contributions occasionally varied across outcomes and time points, such that selecting goal dimensions for concise yet predictive instruments should be guided by pilot studies that evaluate their explanatory power in context.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Predictions</head><p>Goal pursuit is associated with well-being (for reviews of selected goal dimensions, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Hennecke &amp; Brandstätter, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">MacLeod, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b158">Wiese, 2007)</ref>. These effects may be mediated by goal progress if certain goal dimensions affect progress positively and progress, in turns, leads to positive affect <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Brunstein, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Carver &amp; Scheier, 1998</ref>) and a more positive evaluation of one's life circumstances <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Klug &amp; Maier, 2015)</ref>. They may also be more direct, if the appraisal of a goal as high in commitment, enjoyment, expectancy, facilitation, support, and value elicits positive emotions <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bagozzi &amp; Pieters, 1998)</ref>. Conversely, pursuing a goal that is high in goal external motivation and demand may elicit negative emotions and be associated with decreased well-being. The predicted direction of the effects of goal dimensions and wellbeing parallels that of successful goal pursuit in Study 3. Further support for these predictions comes from several theories and studies:</p><p>Self-regulation theory posits that individuals continuously compare their current progress towards a goal with their desired progress <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Carver &amp; Scheier, 1998)</ref>. High progress toward a goal generates positive feedback, leading to elation and relief, which may correspond to increased well-being (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Klug &amp; Maier, 2015)</ref>. On the other hand, highly demanding goals may generate negative feedback, leading to anxiety and depressed feelings, which may correspond to reduced well-being.</p><p>Control-value theory posits that people who pursue a goal experience emotions in response to goal-related situations and activities <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">(Pekrun, 2006)</ref>. Pursuing a highly valued goal and enjoying its pursuit corresponds with positive emotions, such as pride and hope, which may increase overall well-being (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">McGregor et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b148">Steca et al., 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Self-determination theory posits that the pursuit of goals is associated with innate psychological needs, such as autonomy <ref type="bibr" target="#b142">(Sheldon &amp; Elliot, 1999)</ref>. The pursuit of externally motivated goals frustrates these needs, which reduces well-being <ref type="bibr">(Deci &amp; Ryan, 2000)</ref>.</p><p>Hope theory posits that people create mental paths to attain a goal. People high in goal expectancy are more confident, decisive, and certain in following such pathways, which reduces ambiguity, increases agentic thinking, and thereby increases well-being <ref type="bibr" target="#b147">(Snyder, 2002</ref>, see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Gallagher &amp; Lopez, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b106">Michalak et al., 2004)</ref>.</p><p>Goal systems theory posits that sharing means of goal attainment with another goal corresponds to symbiotic effects and overlapping goal attainment strategies <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Kruglanski et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b131">Riediger &amp; Freund, 2004)</ref>. Thus, easier goal pursuit and increased efficacy of facilitative goals may therefore increase well-being (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Boudreaux &amp; Ozer, 2013)</ref>.</p><p>Social cognitive theory posits that goal pursuit is influenced by close others <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bandura, 2001)</ref>. High levels of support in goal pursuit can reduce hindering emotions, such as fear of failure, provide emotional assistance, and endorse the worthiness of a goal, leading to increases in well-being (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">Ruehlman &amp; Wolchik, 1988)</ref>.</p><p>Goal setting theory posits that high goal commitment means being determined to pursue a goal, which promotes positive stress and self-esteem <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">(Locke &amp; Latham, 2002)</ref>. Commitment is also associated with an optimistic view of the goal, which increases well-being <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Brunstein, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Brunstein et al., 1999a)</ref>.</p><p>Following these lines of reasoning, we tested the predicted associations of goal dimensions with measures of well-being at the same time as well as one month later. To ensure these associations were not confounded by stable between-person relationships and to attribute changes in well-being to changes in goal dimensions, we tested the predictions on the basis of within-person relationships.</p><p>Similar to Study 3, these predictions are plausible extrapolations from relevant theories, not direct tests of them. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Carver and Scheier (1998)</ref> examine links between goal progress and momentary affect, whereas our affective well-being measure capture experiences over several weeks. Likewise, the longitudinal associations we tested were derived from theorybased expectations but are not grounded in study designs suited for formal theory testing.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants and procedure</head><p>We analyzed data from four measurement occasions of a longitudinal study that tracked up to two New Year's resolutions per participant from January to April 2022. A part of the data for this study has been previously analyzed for another publication (******). However, this publication focused on different research questions and reports different analyses.</p><p>In January, we recruited as many participants as possible through a recruitment booth on a busy street. During this time, participants responded to the GDQ regarding their resolutions, as well as measures of well-being and additional measures not relevant to the article (but reported on the OSF page). From February through April, participants were asked if they were still pursuing their New Year's resolutions and, if so, completed the questionnaires of this study. Participants completed the consecutive questionnaires at evenly spaced intervals of M = 31 (SD = 2.4) days. All measures were presented in a randomized order.</p><p>The January questionnaire was completed by 297 participants with a mean age of 33.6 years (SD = 15.7). Of these, 194 were female and one participant did not report their gender.</p><p>These participants reported and rated one or two New Year's resolutions for January (n = 296 participants, n = 484 goals), February (n = 223 participants, n = 280 goals), March (n = 177 participants, n = 293 goals), and April (n = 157 participants, n = 256 goals). Participants who dropped out after January showed lower levels of conscientiousness (U = 8483, p = .001) and lower goal progress (U = 8968, p = .04). We employed U-tests to account for non-normally distributed scores on these measures.</p><p>A research assistant coded the participants' goals according to the New Year's resolution categories derived by <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">Oscarsson et al. (2020)</ref>. The categories were as follows:</p><p>physical health (22%), work and studies (20%), self-improvement (14%), mental health and sleep (12%), hobbies and interests (6%), weight loss (5%), friends and family (5%), eating habits (4%), home environment (3%), consumption (2%), finances (2%), tobacco (2%), engagement (2%), alcohol (2%), and love (1%).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures</head><p>We measured goal dimensions using the GDQ. Well-being can be measured in different ways <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Diener et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr">VanderWeele et al., 2020)</ref>. A prominent basic distinction refers to cognitive well-being, that is, evaluative judgments of one's life in general or life satisfaction, and affective well-being, that is, the frequent experience of positive and the rare experience of negative affect <ref type="bibr">(Diener et al., 2003)</ref>.</p><p>Life Satisfaction. We measured life satisfaction using the German version <ref type="bibr">(Schumacher et al., 2003)</ref> of the Satisfaction with Life Scale <ref type="bibr">(Diener et al., 1985)</ref>. The Satisfaction with Life Scale measures global evaluations of one's life on a scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree), for example with the item "I am satisfied with my life".</p><p>Affective Well-Being. We measured affective well-being using the German version <ref type="bibr">(Rahm et al., 2017)</ref> of the Scale of Positive and Negative Emotions <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Diener et al., 2010)</ref>, which measures the frequency of six positive and six negative emotions in the past four weeks, such as "pleasant" or "sad", on a scale from 1 (very rarely or never) to 5 (very often or always). To reduce analytic complexity, we calculated affective well-being as affect balance by subtracting the sum of negative emotion ratings from the sum of positive emotion ratings <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Diener et al., 2010)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Random-Intercept Cross-Lagged Panel Models</head><p>We analyzed the data using random intercept cross-lagged panel models (RI-CLPMs), which relate two variables across successive waves in structural equation models <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Hamaker et al., 2015)</ref>. Central aspects of the RI-CLPM are autoregressions, cross-lagged regressions, cross-sectional correlations, and random intercepts. The autoregressive paths control for the influence of past values of a variable on the current value. The cross-sectional paths indicate the relationship between the two variables at the same time. Positive cross-sectional associations indicate that both variables are above their within-person average, and vice versa for negative associations. The cross-lagged paths indicate how strongly one variable at one time predicts the other variable at the next measurement occasion. The random intercepts account for between-person variability, allowing any cross-lagged relationships to be interpreted as reflecting within-person dynamics.</p><p>Mulder and Hamaker (2021) provide three prebuilt RI-CLPMs for lavaan <ref type="bibr" target="#b132">(Rosseel, 2012)</ref> in R (R Core Team, 2020): a base model without constraints, a model with equality constraints on cross-sectional and lagged effects, and a model with equality constraints on standardized lagged effects. Constraints fix successionally occurring coefficients (i.e., stationarity), allowing for more stable estimators and easier interpretation of results by aggregating detailed information <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">(Mulder &amp; Hamaker, 2021)</ref>. We used the model with constraints on cross-sectional and lagged effects because we were interested not only in cross-lagged effects, but also in constrained cross-sectional associations. Note that the constraints on cross-sectional correlations do not include the first wave, because the exogenous variables of the first wave are not subject to the same autoregressive and cross-lagged effects as their successors (the initial conditions problem; <ref type="bibr" target="#b161">Wooldridge, 2005)</ref>. In addition, the RI-CLPMs with constraints on standardized lagged effects are more complex, and compared to the RI-CLPMs with constraints on cross-sectional and lagged effects, model fit indices were worse or did not improve relative to the indices AIC, BIC, and Chi²-tests (see online supplement). We tested the predictions of this study by computing RI-CLPMs with each of the nine goal dimensions on one side and each of the two well-being measures on the other side, resulting in 18 models. We used two-level RI-CLPMs, with goal dimension scores centered over time and nested in a combined level of goals and persons. As each participant reported only one or two goals, there was insufficient variance at the goal level to model a three-level structure, that is, goal dimensions across time nested in goals, nested in persons. Accordingly, the random intercepts accounted for between-person and between-goal variability simultaneously. Up to two goals per person resulted in 516 goals for models with goal and affective well-being, and 517 goals for models with life satisfaction. Missing data was managed using full-information maximum likelihood estimation.</p><p>As noted above, we aimed to extend the predictions of Study 3 to within-person associations between goal dimensions and successful goal pursuit, as indicated by goal progress. To do this, we computed eight additional RI-CLPMs predicting the goal progress dimension from the remaining goal dimensions, based on 516 goals. The results of these analyses are reported in the General Discussion and the online supplement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Preregistration</head><p>We preregistered our predictions (OSF; https://osf.io/gqy7x). However, the preregistration of this study included RI-CLPMs predicting variables at two measurement points ahead and cross-lagged effects outside of RI-CLPMs, which we did not conduct due to space limitations. For this reason, we report the exploratory associations between personality traits and goal dimensions only in the supplementary material. Furthermore, to increase the number of participants, we extended recruitment from the first two weeks of January (n = 245) until the end of January.</p><p>We did not preregister this but adjusted the significance thresholds for tests of betweenperson correlations involving goal dimensions to account for multiple tests using the <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Benjamini and Hochberg (1995)</ref> procedure, similar to Study 3. We did not correct the thresholds of the RI-CLPMs because their p-values reflect model-implied relationships that already account for measurement error and temporal dynamics, making further correction overly conservative <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Hamaker et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Kline, 2023)</ref>. Additionally, and without having preregistered this, we explored the incremental predictability of goal dimensions using commonality analyses to predict affective well-being life satisfaction, similar to Study 3.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">11</ref> shows that reliability estimates for the goal dimensions range from acceptable to excellent across time points. Between-person omega coefficients are consistently higher than within-person coefficients, indicating that the scales distinguish well between individuals but are less consistent across different goals and time points within individuals. Note. Reliability parameters for months refer to the average of both goals. For computing the Within-Person and Between-Person Omegas, we pooled the goal and time levels to account for the small number of cases on the goal level. Accordingly, the within-person omegas reflect how consistently a person responds to the items measuring a goal dimension across both, different time points and goals, while the between-person omegas reflect how well the items distinguish between different people.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">12</ref> shows the intercorrelations of the study variables at the between-person level and the within-person level. At the within-person level, the time and goal levels were combined.</p><p>At the between-person level, goal demand, enjoyment, expectancy, external motivation, and progress correlated significantly with both affective well-being and life satisfaction, and goal support correlated with life satisfaction. At the within-person level, goal demand, enjoyment, expectancy, and progress correlated significantly with affective well-being. Goal facilitation, commitment, and value did not correlate significantly with well-being.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Random-Intercept Cross-Lagged Panel Models</head><p>Cross-lagged effects of goal dimensions with well-being measures in RI-CLPMs reached significance only for the goal support dimension in predicting life satisfaction one month later.</p><p>Cross-sectionally, goal enjoyment, expectancy, and progress were positively and goal demand negatively associated with affective well-being, and goal enjoyment was additionally associated with life satisfaction (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_16">13</ref> and<ref type="table" target="#tab_17">14</ref>). This means, for example, that if one's goal expectancy at a given measurement occasion is above the personal average across all measurement occasions, it is likely that one's affective well-being will simultaneously also be above one's average.   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>In this study, we analyzed the associations of goal dimensions with measures of affective well-being and life satisfaction using RI-CLPMs. We expected positive associations of goal commitment, enjoyment, expectancy, facilitation, progress, support, and value dimensions  <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">(Nimon et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b117">Nimon &amp; Oswald, 2013)</ref>. Unique contributions refer to the variance in a dependent variable that is exclusively explained by a goal dimension. Common contributions refer to the variance in a dependent variable that is explained by all possible combinations of goal dimensions that include a specific dimension. The total contributions refer to the sum of the unique and common contributions. Negative common contributions indicate suppression effects of a goal dimension.</p><p>with both well-being measures and negative associations of goal demand and external motivation with both well-being measures. We found cross-lagged effects of goal support on life satisfaction. Cross-sectionally, goal demand, enjoyment, and progress were correlated with affective well-being, and goal enjoyment was correlated with life satisfaction. Between-person correlations showed associations between the goal demand, enjoyment, expectancy, external motivation, and progress and both affective well-being and life satisfaction. Additionally, goal support correlated with life satisfaction. Within-person correlations showed associations between the goal demand, enjoyment, expectancy, and progress dimensions and affective wellbeing. We conclude that goal demand, enjoyment, expectancy, and progress most consistently predicted measures of well-being.</p><p>We attribute the lack of cross-lagged associations in part to the monthly measurement intervals. A continued effect of within-person change on a goal dimension on measures of wellbeing after one month may be unlikely. Furthermore, the random intercepts of the RI-CLPMs capture stable between-person variances, and the autoregressive paths control for the effects of a variable on itself over time <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">(Orth et al., 2021)</ref>. The remaining variance in goal dimensions or affective well-being and life satisfaction may not be sufficient to elicit significant cross-sectional or cross-lagged results, even though underlying relationships may be present. For example, if high levels of external motivation to pursue a goal change little over time, fluctuations in low levels of well-being would not have been detected. Between-person analyses with longer measurement intervals may reveal the predicted cross-lagged effects of goal dimensions.</p><p>The lack of expected longitudinal associations raises concerns about the construct validity of the Goal Dimensions Questionnaire, particularly regarding its predictive validity over time. While the questionnaire shows many expected cross-sectional associations, these findings suggest that most goal dimensions may not reflect enduring properties of goal pursuit that influence well-being across one month. This pattern may partially reflect a temporal mismatch, as well-being is often influenced by recent rather than past goal-related experiences <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Carver et al., 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Csikszentmihalyi et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Diener et al., 1999</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Diener et al., , 2018))</ref>. Moreover, it is rare to detect cross-lagged effects in models that control for both between-person and autoregressive withinperson effects. Future research may examine whether alternative formulations of goal dimensions, or shorter measurement intervals, yield stronger longitudinal associations</p><p>We were unable to compute reliability estimates that separately capture within-person consistency across goals and time due to the limited number of goals per person. However, recent analyses using the same dataset showed that variability in goal dimensions over time was associated with individual differences in personality <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Kiendl et al., 2025)</ref>. Further variance partitioning showed that goal dimensions vary most strongly between goals within a person, with less variability over time and between individuals. The variance analyses were feasible as they estimated variability ratios that tolerate sparse data <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Goldstein et al., 2002)</ref>. However, estimating three-level omega coefficients or fitting multilevel RI-CLPMs requires latent variable models that require more observations per cluster to ensure stable model convergence <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">(Maas &amp; Hox, 2005)</ref>.</p><p>Similar to Study 3, commonality analyses showed that goal dimensions such as goal enjoyment contributed uniquely to predicting well-being, while also sharing explained variance with other predictors. This overlap indicates a similarity in predictability. However, differences in the common contributions between outcomes suggest that the goal dimensions driving these effects are not redundant.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Discussion</head><p>Goal dimensions have often been assessed with ad-hoc measures, single items, and no documentation of reliability and validity <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Kiendl &amp; Hennecke, 2022)</ref>. To improve measurement practices and, thereby, strengthen research on goal dynamics, our aim was to develop a validated questionnaire of commonly measured goal dimensions. In four studies, we provide evidence for the reliability and structural and predictive validity of the GDQ. The goal enjoyment, expectancy, and progress dimensions explained a substantial portion of the variance in commonly studied goal dimensions and emerged as the most consistent predictors of successful goal pursuit and well-being. Therefore, they seem essential for a comprehensive measurement of personal goals.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Structural Validity of the Goal Dimensions Questionnaire</head><p>In Studies 1 and 2, we used factor analyses to identify nine major dimensions that characterize personal goals, the GDQ dimensions: commitment, demand, enjoyment, expectancy, external motivation, facilitation, progress, support, and value. Following recommended practice, relevant and representative items from the literature were pre-selected for an exploratory factor analysis followed by confirmatory factor analysis on the final set of items. Reliability estimates of the goal dimension scales varied across the four studies and measurement time points and ranged from acceptable to excellent. Together, these analyses support the structural validity of the GDQ. The final GDQ contains three items per goal dimension, balancing brevity and comprehensiveness. As such, the GDQ is a well-suited measure to capture differences in goal dimensions, providing reliable information while keeping participant burden at a reasonable level.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Predictive Validity of the Goal Dimensions Questionnaire</head><p>In Studies 3 and 4, we further provided information on construct validity by reporting cross-sectional and cross-lagged associations with measures of successful goal pursuit and well-being. We conducted tests of between and within-person predictions. Associations of goal dimensions with successful goal pursuit were partially consistent with our predictions (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">16</ref>). Goal enjoyment, expectancy, progress, and demand were most consistently related to between-person differences in goal attainment (satisfaction with exam performance and exam grade).</p><p>Commonality analyses across studies revealed that goal dimensions made unique and shared contributions to the prediction of important outcomes such as successful goal pursuit and well-being. Shared predictive variance, especially among goal expectancy, enjoyment, and progress, likely reflects their tendency to co-occur in individuals pursuing goals successfully.</p><p>However, the pattern of unique and shared contributions varied by outcome, highlighting the distinctiveness of each dimension and the diverse, yet converging mechanisms through which they are expressed. While goal dimensions are interrelated, their predictive roles for an outcome are not redundant in a way that one goal dimension may fully substitute another. Instead, goal dimensions overlap to different degrees in predicting a specific outcome. These overlaps may inspire future research by providing insight into the joint mechanisms underlying the respective combinations of goal dimensions for that outcome. Moreover, these overlaps can be used to</p><p>develop concise yet predictive instruments by including dimensions that make a large unique contribution to explaining an outcome, while excluding those whose explanatory power is largely covered by the included dimensions. Due to the outcome-specificity of these overlaps, we recommend conducting pilot studies to determine which dimensions have substantial unique explanatory power in a given context and which can be substituted by a combination of others.</p><p>For now, we leave it to researchers to select dimensions from the Goal Dimensions Questionnaire based on their theoretical alignment and research questions.</p><p>Note that we aimed for a comprehensive and parsimonious measure of goal dimensions.</p><p>Measures with more items per goal dimension can cover a dimension in more detail and may detect the predicted effects, such as <ref type="bibr">Ryan et al.'s (1983)</ref> intrinsic motivation inventory (accessible at www.selfdeterminationtheory.org) for measures of external motivation <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Diamantopoulos et al., 2012)</ref>.</p><p>The present studies provide strong evidence for the construct validity of the goal progress scale, supporting its use as an additional indicator of successful goal pursuit. These preregistered predictions are consistent with those of Study 3. Detailed analyses are available in the online supplement. In Study 3, all goal dimensions at T1 were positively associated with goal progress at T2, except for goal demand and external motivation. However, when controlling for goal progress at T1, only goal commitment and expectancy predicted goal progress at T2. In Study 4, RI-CLPMs revealed cross-sectional associations between goal progress and goal commitment, demand, enjoyment, expectancy, facilitation, support, and value, and cross-lagged associations with goal commitment, expectancy, and value. Notably, goal progress was consistently associated with goal commitment across studies, reflecting that both indicate effort during goal pursuit. However, goal progress but not goal commitment was related to satisfaction with performance and exam grade in Study 3, suggesting that a current evaluation of advancement may be a stronger predictor of goal outcomes than ongoing engagement alone.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Goal Dimensions in Theories of Goal Pursuit</head><p>Goal expectancy, progress, and enjoyment emerged as the most consistent predictors of successful goal pursuit and well-being across our studies, highlighting their central role in goal pursuit processes. The goal dimension scales are consistent with constructs from multiple theoretical frameworks, supporting their construct validity. Below, we outline how each of these dimensions is consistent with well-established theoretical perspectives. Goal expectancy is central to Expectancy-Value Theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Eccles &amp; Wigfield, 2002)</ref>, which emphasizes that individuals' beliefs about their competence to achieve a goal directly influence their achievement-related choices, thereby enhancing performance and persistence. Social Cognitive Theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bandura, 2001)</ref> conceptualizes goal expectancy as belief in one's ability to achieve a goal. In addition, Hope Theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b147">(Snyder, 2002)</ref> also highlights goal expectancy, emphasizing its role in planning and confidence in pursuing goals.</p><p>Goal progress plays a central role in Control Theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Carver &amp; Scheier, 1998)</ref>, which views goal pursuit as a feedback loop: goal progress informs affect and guides regulation. When progress aligns with expectations, individuals experience positive affect and maintain engagement; when it falls short, they adjust effort or their strategies. This function of progress is also emphasized in Self-Regulation Theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Baumeister &amp; Vohs, 2007)</ref>, Expectancy-Value Theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b159">(Wigfield &amp; Eccles, 2000)</ref>, and Goal-Setting Theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">(Locke &amp; Latham, 2002)</ref>, all of which underscore the importance of monitoring progress for adaptive regulation.</p><p>Goal enjoyment is addressed in the Self-Determination Theory <ref type="bibr">(Deci &amp; Ryan, 2000)</ref>,</p><p>which conceptualizes it as central to intrinsic motivation, which energizes goal pursuit and supports persistence. Similarly, Interest Theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Hidi &amp; Renninger, 2006)</ref> highlights goal enjoyment as essential for sustaining attention and long-term goal pursuit. Affective-Reflective</p><p>Theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Brand &amp; Ekkekakis, 2018)</ref> suggest that positive affective responses to a goal, such as experiencing enjoyment, facilitate continued goal pursuit through implicit motivational processes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations and Future Direction</head><p>In addition to establishing longitudinal associations between the GDQ scales and successful goal pursuit and well-being, further steps to provide information on external validity may include investigating causal relationships <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Flake et al., 2017)</ref>. Evidence of causal validity can be provided if the values of goal dimensions change as expected in response to changes in the attribute being measured <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Borsboom et al., 2004)</ref>. One could, for example, test whether experimentally strengthening goal commitment increases commitment measures or observing individuals experiencing partnership segregation decreases goal support measures. Additional validity evidence may be obtained by creating a nomological network in which the association strengths between GDQ scales and similar and different constructs are analyzed and compared <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Campbell &amp; Fiske, 1959;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b152">Tennant et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b165">Ziegler et al., 2013</ref>; for example, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Lee et al., 2024)</ref>. This allows to control for possible confounding variables, such as the effect of high levels in the personality trait conscientiousness on goal dimensions and outcome measures <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Gellatly, 1996)</ref>.</p><p>Further important validity evidence may be provided by incorporating considerations of ecological validity, or the extent to which our results generalize from our study context to other contexts <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Flake et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Kane, 2013)</ref>. Goal pursuit in the contexts of Study 3 (academic goals) and Study 4 (New Year's resolutions) may be highly contingent on individual agency whereas goal pursuit in other contexts like work or team sport may be more contingent on external conditions (e.g., a supervisor's management style or team members' support). In turn, goal dimensions like commitment, expectancy, enjoyment, progress, and demand may have been more relevant to goal achievement and well-being than goal dimensions that, to a larger extent, also capture external conditions, for example, goal external motivation, support, and facilitation <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">(Little, 2007)</ref>. Thus, we recommend testing the predictive validity of goal dimensions across different contexts: Goal external motivation may show stronger effects when individual goal pursuit is more dependent on others, like work environments <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Kanfer, 2012)</ref>. Goal support may show stronger effects when goals are pursued in a group <ref type="bibr" target="#b151">(Taylor, 2011)</ref>. And goal facilitation may show the expected associations for goals that have strong intergoal relations such as health and hedonic goals <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Boudreaux &amp; Ozer, 2013)</ref>.</p><p>Given that the development of the Goal Dimensions Questionnaire is based on mid-level goals, the extent to which our findings generalize to more abstract or more concrete goals remains uncertain. For instance, the factor structure identified in Study 1 may reflect specific characteristics of mid-level goals. Certain dimensions, such as goal facilitation, may not emerge in exploratory factor analysis or may function differently in the context of highly abstract goals, which may lack the behavioural specificity needed for meaningful intergoal interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Kruglanski et al., 2002)</ref>. Future research may explore whether different goal levels elicit distinct dimensional structures or necessitate adaptations to the scale.</p><p>A possible confound in interpreting the results of Studies 3 and 4 is the inability to determine whether the observed associations reflect general properties of the goal dimensions or are specific to the mid-level of goal abstraction. The theories underlying our predictions may apply more closely to concrete task goals and may not fully capture mid-level goals. This could help explain results such as the absence of expected longitudinal associations between most goal dimensions and well-being outcomes. Rather than undermining the construct validity of the questionnaire, this suggests that future research is needed to examine the interactions between goal level and goal dimensions.</p><p>We acknowledge that some of the significant associations in our studies may have been influenced by the measurement context. Specifically, explicitly stating and repeatedly reflecting on personal goals throughout the surveys may have increased goal salience and encouraged more active engagement that may not generalize outside the measurement context <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">(Morwitz &amp; Fitzsimons, 2004)</ref>. In addition, the longitudinal tracking of participants may have introduced demand characteristics, leading participants to prioritize goal pursuit or present their progress in a more cohesive and socially acceptable way <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">(Orne, 1962)</ref>. These factors could limit the ecological validity of our findings and should be considered when interpreting the results.</p><p>Finally, we are not aware of a unifying theory that encompasses all goal dimensions measured by the Goal Dimensions Questionnaire. Such a theory may recognize that goal dimensions are not only related to outcomes but are also interrelated and that they might result from broader constructs such as personality traits or motives <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Costantini et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b114">Musek, 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b162">Wright, 2016)</ref>. Integrating research findings in such a framework improves the comparability of individual study results and enhances our overall understanding of goal dimensions. A unifying theory of goal dimensions would characterize their unique and interactive effects on people's behaviour, cognitions, emotions, and situations in service of their goals <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Carver &amp; Scheier, 1998)</ref>.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>.

Regarding within-person cross-lagged effects of RI-CLPMs, only support predicted well-being, particularly life satisfaction, one month later. Cross-sectionally, more within-person associations emerged as significant: Goal demand, enjoyment, expectancy, and progress were associated with affective well-being, and goal enjoyment was associated with life satisfaction. Overall, goal demand, enjoyment, expectancy, and progress showed the most consistent positive associations of goal dimensions with successful goal pursuit and well-being.  We adjusted the significance thresholds of between-person analyses per group of the nine goal dimensions due to their relatedness, as shown in their intercorrelations <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Benjamini &amp; Hochberg, 1995)</ref>. We did not adjust the significance thresholds of within-person analyses because their cross-sectional and cross-lagged relations are robust by being aggregated across time points.</p></div>			</div>
