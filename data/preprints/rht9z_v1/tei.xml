			<abstract>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Humans' abilities for complex social learning and collective adaptation are unparalleled across species. Yet it is largely unknown how people integrate dynamically changing personal and social cues in realistic environments, resulting in collective intelligence or maladaptive behavior. Here, we report an online 3D immersive-reality experiment in which participants (n = 621) searched for and tracked a mobile resource under realistic visual-spatial constraints. Participants completed the task either alone or in groups of five with different types of social information and resource speeds. Contrasting earlier work, participants in groups outperformed solitary individuals, but only when payoff information was available. High-resolution visual field data and movement trajectories revealed that payoff visibility prompted adaptive recalibration of visual information flow, thereby enabling flexible adaptation.</p><p>Computational models of fine-grained movement decisions and agent-based simulations showed that payoff information let participants dynamically identify and selectively respond to reliable social cues, thus unlocking the group's collective potential.</p></div>

Moving beyond cataloging social learning strategies <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Laland, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr">Kendal et al., 2018a)</ref>, recent studies have investigated the flexible integration of different social and asocial cues, linking individuallevel strategies to collective adaptations <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Toyokawa et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Deffner et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Wu et al., 2025)</ref>. Emerging theoretical frameworks suggest that the same cognitive mechanisms might underlie learning about both social and non-social environmental features, with individuals assessing social cues as indicators of potential rewards <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Heyes, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Schultner et al., 2025)</ref>.</p><p>The cues individuals rely on in realistic collective scenarios and how they arbitrate between dynamically changing social and non-social features to achieve collective intelligence remains poorly understood. Most previous experiments relied on simplified paradigms in which participants chose from a limited set of options at fixed intervals and social information was presented in a structured and summarized format <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Tump et al., 2024)</ref>. Such paradigms lack the visual-spatial richness of real-world social dynamics, where perceptual and spatial constraints fundamentally shape the costs and benefits of social information use <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Mezey et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Wu et al., 2025)</ref>. These simplified paradigms typically assume that relevant social features are predefined, instead of requiring participants to infer which features are reliably associated with success <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Schultner et al., 2025)</ref>. To understand the social-learning mechanisms governing adaptive and maladaptive outcomes in real-world collectives, paradigms that allow complex social dynamics to unfold within naturalistic environments are essential.</p><p>We used a large-scale immersive-reality approach to study how groups of online participants search for and track a mobile resource. Collective search provides an ideal testbed to study dynamic social learning and collective behavior in a controlled, yet ecologically relevant, context <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Deffner et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Garg et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Mezey et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Wu et al., 2025;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Schakowski et al., 2025)</ref>. Previous theoretical work and experiments with fish have uncovered the self-organized "collective sensing" phenomenon, where collectives successfully detect and track a rewarding location in the environment using rudimentary processing of personal information <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Berdahl et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Hein et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Puckett et al., 2018)</ref>. Instead of solving the complicated inference problem of tracking shifting environmental gradients, individuals can collectively adapt to complex environments by responding to simple social cues, such as the location of other animals. In a series of experiments mirroring the original work on fish, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Hawkins et al. (2023)</ref> showed that without payoff information, human participants could infer the location of a hidden scoring region based on observable movement trajectories, suggesting powerful social inference. This paradigm, however, used an unrealistic bird's-eye view, representing participants as moving shapes on a flat surface. Participants could directly see when others stopped moving; while reliable, this type of cue for social inference is usually unavailable outside the lab. Moreover, people in the real world often need to balance personal and social information simultaneously. Monitoring one's own personal reward rates as well as the behavior of others might interfere with the adaptive calibration of social information use. To study collective search and tracking in a more realistic scenario with a limited first-person field of view, realistic spatial constraints, and continuous integration of personal and social information, we developed a 3D immersive-reality experiment that created a natural trade-off between individual exploration of the environment and social learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Rahmani et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bastien &amp; Romanczuk, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Deffner et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Wu et al., 2025)</ref>.</p><p>Participants (n = 621) were instructed to search and track a hidden moving resource to maximize a monetary reward (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>; see "Methods" for details; Supplementary Video 1). The closer participants were to its center, the more points they collected. Participants could find and track the resource by looking at their avatar's detector values, indicating their current distance to the resource center (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>; Supplementary Videos 2 and 3). Participants completed 15 min of the task in a 4 × 2 between-subjects design (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref>). Across four conditions, participants completed the task by themselves (Alone, A), in groups where they could see others but had no information about their payoffs (No Payoff-Sharing, NP), in groups where others' current payoffs were always indicated by a colored sign above their heads (Full Payoff-Sharing, FP), or in groups where participants could freely decide whether and when to share their current payoffs at a small cost (Voluntary Payoff-Sharing, VP). Participants experienced either a slow or fast resource, moving at 40% or 80% of their avatar's speed, respectively. The resource movement followed a Lévy walk consisting of frequent short steps and rare long steps, characteristic of biological movement across scales <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Zaburdaev et al., 2015)</ref>. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1D</ref> shows that the optimal rotation magnitude (i.e., the degree to which people turn relative to the previous movement direction) follows a simple heuristic: A rapid decrease in detector value (indicating moving away from the resource center) should prompt large rotations, while a sharp increase in detector value (indicating moving toward the center) should prompt continued movement in the same direction. The ranges of optimal rotations are narrower for the slow resource because there is less uncertainty about the location of the resource center (see Supplementary Information Section S4 for the mathematical derivation of the optimal rotation model and Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1D</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2</ref> for illustration).</p><p>Based on the collective sensing literature, we predicted that search and tracking would be more efficient for collectives than for solitary individuals, resulting in better performance in the No Payoff-Sharing and Full Payoff-Sharing conditions compared to the Alone condition (see preregistration at AsPredicted: https://aspredicted.org/C62_M6Z). We further predicted that within our dynamically changing immersive environment, the location of others would be insufficient for full social inference, resulting in superior performance in the Full Payoff-Sharing condition compared to the No Payoff-Sharing condition. Finally, simulation work has shown that unconditional sharing of payoff information can evolve in collective search, acting as a recruitment signal that facilitates the self-organization of groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Tump et al., 2019)</ref>. We therefore predicted that participants in the Voluntary Payoff-Sharing condition would pay a small cost to share payoff information, and that their performance would fall in between the performance of participants in the No Payoff-Sharing and Full Payoff-Sharing conditions.</p><p>Our behavioral analyses (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>) show that sociality was a double-edged sword: Participants in groups could outperform solitary individuals through both superior tracking and search performance, but only when full payoff information was available; in the absence of payoff information, they sometimes even performed worse, especially when tracking a fast-moving resource. We leveraged high-resolution time-series data of participants' visual information and movement trajectories to study how key events (e.g., resource discoveries) triggered adaptive changes in visibility networks (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>). We found that payoff information boosted performance by allowing collectives to flexibly reorganize visibility networks over time and adaptively guide information flow between group members. We then designed a computational model predicting movement decisions on a second-to-second resolution to test how private and social features jointly guided participants' movement behavior (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>). Computational results confirmed that payoff information unlocked collective intelligence by allowing participants to selectively tune their responses to the position and movement direction of successful peers. Finally, to link our mechanistic insights back to the observed collective dynamics and to gain generalizable insights beyond the specific settings of our experiment, we developed an agent-based simulation, which corroborated our finding that payoff selectivity was indeed the key factor promoting adaptive collective outcomes-but only in certain types of environments (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref>).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Performance depends on the social environment and resource speed</head><p>We start by comparing performance across the eight treatment conditions to show that collective intelligence only arises under certain circumstances. We use three performance metrics: tracking time (i.e., proportion of time participants spent on the resource), tracking efficiency (i.e., average number of points collected when participants were on the resource), and total While the exact optimal rotation angle cannot be inferred from δ, the optimal rotation magnitude follows a simple heuristic: ψ scales linearly with δ (see Supplementary Information Section S4 for the mathematical derivation of the optimal rotation model). This means that sharp increase in points call for minimal rotation, whereas sharp decrease call for maximal rotation.</p><p>number of points, which is a function of both components (color gradient in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>). Using In the slow resource environment (dashed box in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>), participants in all three group conditions collected more points compared to solitary participants (NP: 1,286.73 <ref type="bibr">3,</ref><ref type="bibr">366.14],</ref><ref type="bibr">VP: 3,</ref><ref type="bibr">137.53 [1,</ref><ref type="bibr">126.32,</ref><ref type="bibr">5,</ref><ref type="bibr">079.08];</ref><ref type="bibr">FP: 5,</ref><ref type="bibr">236.22 [3,</ref><ref type="bibr">373.83,</ref><ref type="bibr">7,</ref><ref type="bibr">129.94]</ref>). Participants in groups with full payoff information (FP) collected more points than participants in groups with no payoff information <ref type="bibr">(3,949.48 [1,876.26, 6,</ref> In the fast resource environment (dotted box in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>), only participants in FP groups collected more points than solitary ones <ref type="bibr">(1,710.26 [572.81, 2,803.50]</ref>). Participants in VP groups performed on par with singletons <ref type="bibr">(-298.66 [-1,169.61, 537.86]</ref>), and participants in NP groups performed worse than singletons <ref type="bibr">(-834.66 [-1,654.19, -35.59]</ref>). The superior performance of participants in FP groups resulted from them spending more time on the resource while achieving equal tracking efficiency compared to singletons. Participants in NP and VP groups, on the other hand, had similar tracking times but substantially worse tracking efficiency than singletons, resulting in worse overall performance (see Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">S2,</ref><ref type="table" target="#tab_9">S4</ref>, and S5 for statistical comparisons of scores, tracking times, and tracking efficiencies). Participants in the FP condition had the lowest variability in points collected in both resource environments, whereas single participants had the highest (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">S3</ref>), suggesting that collective foraging can buffer the risks of searching for resources in dynamic environments <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Caraco, 1981)</ref>. In sum, these results suggest that in slow-changing environments, it is beneficial to be in a group. In fast-changing environments, however, merely observing the location of others may lead to maladaptive use of social information, which can only be offset by additional payoff information.</p><p>Our mathematical derivation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1D</ref>; Supplementary Information Section S4) revealed a simple heuristic for optimal rotation for tracking the resource: Rotate if the detector value decreases, and continue in the same direction if it increases. Across conditions, participants followed this heuristic (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref>; see Fig. <ref type="figure">S6</ref> for condition-specific results). When they were moving towards the center of the resource, they displayed a relatively small angle of rotation;</p><p>when they were moving away from the center, they displayed a large angle of rotation.</p><p>Payoff information shapes the structure and adaptability of visibility networks</p><p>We used visibility network analysis to show that payoff information increased adaptive visual connectivity and boosted performance by allowing collectives to flexibly reorganize visibility networks over time. At both resource speeds, participants in FP groups had higher overall connectivity, with both higher in-and out-degrees, than did participants in NP and VP groups (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3A</ref>; see Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">S6</ref> and<ref type="table" target="#tab_12">S7</ref> for statical comparisons). This suggests that participants looked more at others when information about others' payoffs was available. In all conditions, we observed a strong negative correlation between participants' in-and out-degrees (Fig. <ref type="figure">S8</ref>), replicating previous results from an immersive foraging experiment with static rewards <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Wu et al., 2025)</ref>. This suggests an asymmetry in the flow of social information, with some participants being frequently observed by others while rarely observing others themselves, and other participants frequently observing others while rarely being observed themselves. Participants' in-degree and out-degree were systematically related to their performance in almost all conditions (Fig. <ref type="figure">S9</ref>). Participants who collected more points paid little visual attention to others (low out-degree), but received a lot of visual attention from others (high in-degree).</p><p>High-performing participants became focal points. These effects were strongest in the FP conditions, and weakest in the NP conditions, suggesting that the availability of high-quality social information provided more scope for adaptive selective visual attention.</p><p>We next quantified the differences in quality of social information across conditions. To capture the potential for beneficial social information use, for all times when participants had one or more other participants in their field of view, we calculated the probability that at least one of these other participants was closer to the resource center than the focal participant.</p><p>Across resource speeds, and when both searching and tracking, participants in the FP groups were more likely to observe others in better positions than themselves compared to partici-  <ref type="table" target="#tab_13">S8</ref> for statistical comparisons). In sum, payoff information increased overall social connectivity (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3A</ref>), as well as the adaptiveness of social connectivity (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3B</ref>).</p><p>We studied the temporal adaptation of visibility networks by analyzing how participants changed their visual attention in situations where one participant discovered the resource while the others were searching for it (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3C</ref>; see Methods for details). The frequency of such events was much higher in the fast resource environment (829 instances for fast vs. 261 for slow; see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_14">S9</ref>), since participants were more likely to lose (and rediscover) the resource when it moved quickly. We therefore focus on the fast resource environments in the main text (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">S11</ref> for results for the slow environments). In the FP condition, participants who discovered the resource (the "discoverer") received much more visual attention (i.e., in-degree)  This reconfiguration of visibility networks after resource discoveries had tangible adaptive consequences. The probability that "others" would be on the resource increased more markedly over time in the FP condition compared to the other conditions (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3C</ref>, top right). Moreover, this greater availability of local social information allowed discoverers in FP groups to stay on the resource for longer compared to solitary individuals who discovered the resource, whereas discoverers in other group conditions lost it sooner (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3C</ref>, top left; see Figs. S14, S15 for corroborating results comparing sharing and non-sharing events in the VP condition). These results underscore how continued access to payoff information enabled FP groups to quickly adapt their visibility networks over time and achieve a higher tracking time than participants in NP and VP groups (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>). Others were able to capitalize on the discoveries of group members, and even discoverers themselves benefited from the recruitment of social information to their local environment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Computational model of movement decisions</head><p>To show how behavioral outcomes arose from participants' fine-grained decisions, we developed a computational model of movement decisions that formalizes hypotheses about the relative importance participants place on different private and social cues (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>). We modeled participants' absolute changes in movement direction as a linear combination of private and social features. We used the magnitude of rotations instead of directions because our mathematical derivations showed that changes in detector values only provide information on how much an optimal agent should rotate, and not in which direction (see Supplementary Information Section S6 and Figs. S16, S17 for an analysis of rotation direction that reaches the same main conclusions). Search and tracking were analyzed in separate models because different sets of features were available for each state.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Private information features</head><p>To study how participants responded to their personal rewards, we quantified two features: The distance feature reflects a participant's distance to the resource center, which they can infer from their absolute detector value, and the detector change feature reflects the change in this distance since the previous time step (in seconds), which is the key factor determining optimal  tracking according to our analytical derivation. Note that both features were only available to participants when they were on the resource.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Social information features</head><p>To study how participants responded to different visible social cues, we quantified four social features. The position of others represents the angular difference between a participant's heading direction and the average position of others within a participant's field of view, thus indicating where others are. The movement direction of others reflects the angular difference between a participant's heading direction and the average movement direction of others within their field of view, indicating where others are going. We also included the interactions between each of these features and social information quality. For tracking, social information quality is computed as the difference between one's own distance to the center and the average distance of visible others. For searching, the value of social information quality is set to 1 if another visible participant is currently on the resource and to -1 otherwise. These interactions allow for adaptive tuning of social information use depending on the performance of others (which may or may not be directly visible, depending on the condition). All features were normalized to a range between [-1, 1] to allow for comparisons of all shared features across conditions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Model weights</head><p>When tracking the resource, participants in all conditions rotated more if they were further from the resource center and if their distance to the center had increased within the last second (i.e., their payoffs decreased; see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4B</ref>). Participants responded most strongly to detector changes in the alone condition; participants in the FP groups responded least strongly. This reduced reliance on private cues in the presence of increasingly reliable forms of social information confirms the attentional and/or behavioral trade-off between private and social cues and raises a key question: If optimal rotation during tracking is purely determined by the current change in payoffs and FP groups were least sensitive to this key piece of private information, how were they able to outperform all other conditions in slow environments and match singletons in fast</p><p>environments?</p><p>The answer lies in their more selective use of social information. Overall, participants used social information to inform their movement choices (all social information feature weights greater than 0) and social information features influenced participants' rotation decisions similarly across both tracking and search states and across both resource speeds (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4C</ref>). However, there were crucial differences among payoff sharing conditions. Participants in all group conditions relied on the position of others: They rotated more if others were in the periphery of their field of view. Participants in FP groups tended to respond most strongly to others' positions (except when searching in the slow resource environment). Mirroring the behavioral results, the behavior of participants in VP groups tended to fall in between that of the FP and NP groups. Participants also relied on the movement direction of others, rotating more if their movement direction differed greatly from the average movement direction of others in their field of view. Once again, participants in the FP condition responded most strongly to the movement direction of others compared to NP and VP conditions, and the performance of participants in VP groups tended to fall in between that of the FP and NP groups.</p><p>Next, we turn to the interaction between the social features and social information quality in order to examine the selectivity in participants' reliance on social information. Participants in FP groups flexibly tuned their social information use, responding more strongly to the position and movement direction of others if they provided higher-quality information. In the slow resource environment, participants in NP groups, where payoff information was not explicitly shared, also adjusted their behavior based on the payoffs of others. This finding suggests that they were able to infer the success of others solely based on their behavior-albeit to a limited degree. In the fast resource environment, however, only participants with visible payoff information could flexibly adjust their reliance on the behavior of others, suggesting important limits to social inference in fast-changing environments. More generally, differences in use of social cues between payoff-sharing conditions were much more pronounced in fast resource environments (both during tracking and searching) than in slow resource environments.</p><p>To identify the adaptive consequences of decision-making, we used the random effects of the feature weights from the multilevel computational model to predict success in terms of tracking efficiency and tracking time (see Supplementary Information Section S7). Higher detector sensitivity was generally associated with higher tracking efficiency across all conditions.</p><p>Following others' positions was associated with lower tracking efficiency, whereas aligning with others' movement direction was associated with higher efficiency (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">S18</ref>), suggesting that where others were going was a more reliable cue for success than where they were. Importantly, selectivity with respect to both position and movement direction of others was reliably associated with tracking efficiency, again confirming that selective tuning of social information use depending on payoffs was crucial for success (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">S19</ref> for results on searching that confirm the core insights).</p><p>In sum, the computational model highlights the critical role of social information quality in shaping participants' movement decisions. When payoff information was available, participants overall relied more on social cues. They modulated their social information use depending on information quality by selectively using social cues when others were performing better than themselves. The model also allowed us to examine how flexibly participants integrated social and private information features, revealing a dynamic trade-off based on contextual factors.   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A mechanistic agent-based simulation</head><p>To confirm that payoff selectivity was the key factor determining collective outcomes and to gain generalizable insights beyond the two resource environments studied in the experiment, we developed a mechanistic agent-based simulation of the task. At each simulation time step, agents decided on their next movement direction based on either private or social information, with the social probability (p social ) depending on the quality of available social cues (i.e., the difference in current payoffs between agents and observed others), and their selectivity in responding to those cues (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5A</ref>). High selectivity meant that agents only used social information if others were doing better than they were at the time. If agents followed social information, they compromised between their previous movement direction and the average position of others.</p><p>When agents instead relied on private information (with probability 1 -p social ), they followed the heuristic identified before (see Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1D</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref>): They continued in the same direction if they were approaching the resource center and rotated if they moved away from the center (see "Methods" for a detailed description).</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5B</ref> plots tracking time and tracking efficiency for social agents compared to solitary agents (large black dot) across a range of resource speeds (shape) and degrees of selectivity (color). Unsurprisingly, agents that were highly selective in their social information use spent more time on the resource and had a higher tracking efficiency. While agents in groups outperformed singletons across a broad range of selectivity values in terms of tracking time, only highly selective social agents outperformed singletons in terms of tracking efficiency. The costs and benefits of sociality were also modulated by the speed of the resource. In fast-moving environments (80% and 100% of agents' speed), social agents spent slightly more time on the resource compared to singletons, with only small effects of selectivity. In slow-moving environments (20% and 40% of agents' speed), selectivity had a much greater influence on tracking time: Social agents spent either less or substantially more time on the resource compared to singletons, depending on the degree of selectivity. Crucially, social agents outperformed singletons in both tracking time and efficiency only when the resource moved at a moderately slow pace (40% of agents' speed) and when social information was used selectively.</p><p>These simulation results largely match our experimental findings, and help explain them in more detail. In our experimental slow-moving environment (with the resource moving at 40% of agents' speed), participants in FP groups outperformed singletons in both performance metrics (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>), providing a direct match with the only resource speed at which this is predicted to happen for highly selective agents. In the simulation, relatively non-selective social agents could also spend more time on the resource than singletons, confirming the empirical finding that-at least in slow environments-participants in NP and VP groups outperformed the tracking time of singletons. However, non-selective agents could not match the tracking efficiency of singletons either empirically or in the simulation. Additional simulations (see Supplementary Information Section S8 and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">S20</ref>) showed that the benefits of selectivity were strongest for imperfect individual trackers. This result suggests that selective social learning is particularly consequential when private cues are unreliable or ambiguous. Agents with high detector sensitivity performed well with less-selective social strategies, indicating that strong reliance on private information could mitigate the risks of maladaptive social influence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Flexible social learning is often a shortcut to better decision making. It underlies humans' collective adaptability and, ultimately, our success as a species <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Henrich &amp; McElreath, 2003</ref>; Probability of acting based on social information (p social ) depends on social information quality (q t ). If agents followed social information, they rotated towards the center of the locations of other agents in their field of view. If they followed private information, the rotation magnitude was proportional to the change in detector value (δ t ) and the rotation direction depended on the outcome of the previous rotation. Bottom right: Agents' selectivity to social information quality; colored lines represent degrees of selectivity. Highly selective agents (yellow) only followed social information if agents in their field of view were performing better than they were at the time; non-selective agents (blue) followed others independently of quality. (B) Average tracking time vs. tracking efficiency of groups relative to solitary agents (black dot). Colors show selectivity levels; opaque points correspond to the two experimental speeds (40% and 80%). <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Kendal et al., 2018b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Galesic et al., 2023</ref>). Yet little is known about how collective intelligence emerges in naturalistic mobile human groups dealing with dynamically changing environments.</p><p>There is also limited knowledge of how people in such complex tasks integrate dynamic personal and social features, and how these strategies interact with environments, leading to adaptive or maladaptive collective outcomes.</p><p>Our immersive-reality experiment shows that groups can outperform singletons in such complex environments, under specific conditions: Only when participants could observe others' payoffs continuously did groups outperform singletons. Contrasting previous findings from the collective-sensing literature in animals <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Berdahl et al., 2013)</ref> and in humans using more abstract experiments <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Hawkins et al., 2023)</ref>, groups performed worse than singletons when they only had access to the locations of others-especially when tracking a fast-moving resource. Visibility network analysis and computational modeling confirmed that these differences in collective outcomes stem from the way people balance private and social cues, with full payoff information allowing for rapid reconfiguration of visibility networks and selective tuning of social information use.</p><p>To be successful in our paradigm, participants needed to find efficient strategies for both searching the resource and tracking its center. Our analysis reveals that payoff selectivity is key for both components of adaptive behavior. During the search phase, when a participant discovered the resource, payoff information allowed groups to flexibly adjust their visual connections and orient themselves towards the discoverer, enabling them to rapidly converge on the resource location <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Almaatouq et al., 2020)</ref>. In contrast, without reliable payoff information, resource discoveries went mostly unnoticed by other group members, making it impossible to reap the collective benefits of costly search <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Mezey et al., 2024)</ref>. During the tracking phase, payoff information allowed participants to flexibly exploit social information, relying on others' behavior only when it provided adaptive information. In fact, payoff selectivity allowed participants in groups to achieve a higher tracking efficiency compared to solitary individuals (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>), while being less sensitive to otherwise essential private information about changes in reward rates (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4C</ref>). They did this by following both the locations and movement directions of others, primarily when group members were better positioned than they were. Because, unlike previous experiments, our task involved an inherent trade-off between private and social information use, following others without a quality filter backfired in groups without reliable payoff information, lowering their performance compared to singletons. Moreover, this maladaptive overuse of social information was amplified by greater environmental volatility: Since the resource location moved faster, positional cues were no longer reliable predictors of future resource locations, whereas visible payoffs still provided real-time information on the environmental target, thereby ensuring collective adaptation even in rapidly changing conditions.</p><p>Our agent-based simulations not only confirmed the decisive role of payoff selectivity for collective performance, they also clarified the role of the environment. During search, when private information is absent, low-quality social information also provides beneficial hints about resource location, resulting in collective improvements in tracking time (i.e., time on the resource) across a wide range of environments. During tracking, participants need to strategically balance private detector feedback and social cues, limiting the environments in which social information-even if used selectively-is beneficial. When the resource moves slowly, private information is sufficient for tracking the resource and social cues offer little additional value.</p><p>When the resource moves quickly, on the other hand, reliance on potentially outdated social cues at the expense of private information impairs tracking and frequently leads to losing the resource. Between those extremes lies an ecological "sweet spot"-corresponding to the slowresource condition in the experiment-where social information use not only benefits searching but also tracking the resource. Because private cues can be ambiguous and mapping observed detector changes to optimal movement decisions can be cognitively demanding, simply copying high-performing neighbors overcomes this deficiency and increases performance beyond the level of singletons.</p><p>Future work could systematically vary group size, which proved important for collectiveforaging dynamics in simulations <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Beauchamp, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Mezey et al., 2024)</ref>, in order to investigate how the costs and benefits of social information use across environments might change as groups become larger. Moreover, we only considered groups of identical agents. Systematically examining the role of individual heterogeneity within groups-both synthetic and human-may reveal a more complex picture of the optimality and trade-offs that individuals face in collective search and tracking. Importantly, by showcasing a way of studying human behavior beyond the highly constrained paradigms often used in cognitive science, psychology, and economics, our work also paves the way towards analyses of collective human adaptation outside of the lab, for example, during social foraging <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Schakowski et al., 2025)</ref>.</p><p>In line with simulation work predicting that unconditional payoff sharing can evolve by recruiting group members as potentially useful sources of social information <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Tump et al., 2019)</ref>, results from the Voluntary Payoff-Sharing condition showed that participants were indeed willing to pay a personal cost to actively share payoff information with others. This active payoff sharing not only resulted in more adaptive visual information flow following resource discoveries and more selective tuning of social information use, but also improved overall performance compared to groups without the ability to share payoffs. Future work could explore sharing tendencies in groups of different sizes-simulations predict unconditional sharing to decline in larger groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Tump et al., 2019)</ref>-and further elucidate the underlying decision rules of active payoff sharing. Is payoff sharing driven by reciprocity, normative pressures within the group, or stable altruistic tendencies? To isolate these motives, our experimental design could be adjusted to tease apart competing mechanisms. Intriguingly, collective foraging has recently been posited as a powerful framework to model the evolution of prosocial communication and human language <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Cambier et al., 2024)</ref>, generating predictions that can be tested using our framework.</p><p>Our study demonstrates that collective intelligence does not automatically emerge under naturalistic conditions as soon as multiple individuals are grouped together-instead, it depends on the specific way that personal and social cues are integrated and is sensitive to environmental volatility. By combining behavioral and dynamic visibility-network analyses with fine-grained computational modeling and agent-based simulations, we provide multiple complementary lines of evidence identifying payoff selectivity as the key driver of collective intelligence in spatial search and tracking. These findings pinpoint the conditions under which shared information transforms a group of individuals into an intelligent collective, and pave the way for future investigations of social interactions in naturalistic groups.</p></div>

We removed participants who did not complete the experiment (n = 21); who had a very low frame rate (&gt; 5% below the target of 10 Hz), causing faulty rendering of the environment (n = 27); who did not move for more than 25% of the experiment (n = 29); who were assigned to group conditions but could not be matched within 10 min (n = 59); and who were in groups with more than one invalid participant (n = 39). This resulted in a final sample size of 621 (female: 239; male: 381; prefer not to say: 1; M age = 33.56, SD age = 10.17; see Supplementary Table <ref type="table">1</ref> for an overview of the number of participants for each of the eight conditions). Participants earned a baseline of £3 for completing the study and could earn a bonus of up to £2 based on their individual performance (i.e., total score). Participants in the top 10% of performance within each condition received a £2 bonus, participants in the 10-50% range received a £1 bonus, and participants in the 50-75% range received a £0.50 bonus. Our preregistration is accessible at https://aspredicted.org/C62_M6Z.</p><p>Participants completed 15 min of the task in a 4 × 2 between-subjects design (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref>; see Supplementary Information Section S3 for details on assignment procedures and dates of data collection). Participants were allotted to one of four payoff conditions, completing the task by themselves (Alone, A), in groups where others' locations but not payoffs were available (No Payoff-Sharing, NP), in groups where others' payoffs were also available (Full Payoff-Sharing, FP), or in groups where participants could decide whether to share their payoff information (Voluntary Payoff-Sharing, VP). In the NP condition, participants could observe and interact with their group members in real time, but could not see how many points they were currently collecting. In the FP condition, they could also observe their group members' current payoffs (indicated by a colored beam above avatars; see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Participants could thus directly observe the resource quality at each group member's location, provided they were in their field of view.</p><p>In the VP condition, participants could continuously decide whether they wanted to share their current payoff information or not at a cost of 1 point per second.</p><p>Participants were tasked to search and track either a slow or fast resource. The slow resource was fairly easy to follow: It moved at 2.8 m/s, corresponding to 40% of participants' speed. The fast resource was fairly difficult to follow: It moved at 5.6 m/s, corresponding to 80% of participants' speed. The resource movement followed a Lévy walk, with step lengths drawn from a power-law distribution with a shape parameter α = 1 (limited to steps between 1 and 100 m), and movement directions sampled from a uniform distribution. If the resource center approached the boundary of the environment, the movement direction was resampled.</p><p>Qualitatively, resource movement consisted of frequent short steps and infrequent long steps (an example of a resource movement trajectory is available at https://youtu.be/pHE5aOMb1_M or as Video 1 in the supplementary materials).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental procedure</head><p>After reading the instructions and passing comprehension checks, participants completed a tutorial to familiarize themselves with the task and controls. Participants in group conditions then entered a virtual waiting room in order to be matched with other participants. The experiment started after a group of five was formed. Participants who could not be matched within 10 min were financially compensated and removed from the experiment.</p><p>In the experiment, participants were immersed in a 3D environment, freely navigating an astronaut avatar from a first-person perspective (90 • horizontal and 60 • vertical field of view) through a circular crater on a distant planet (400 m diameter; see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> and videos of the experiment at https://youtu.be/AcfIw_qWR_Q and https://youtu.be/xY7nzh4vF4o, or Videos 2 and 3 in the supplementary materials).</p><p>Participants could move left, forward, or right using the "A," "W," and "D" keys, respectively, or using the corresponding arrow keys. They could move at 7 m/s and rotate at 150 • /s, and were instructed to locate and track a hidden, mobile resource in order to collect points and maximize their bonus payment. The resource was circular and had a 40 m radius, yielding a payoff of 40 points/s in the center, linearly decreasing to one point/s at the edge. Avatars held a resource detector indicating the resource quality (i.e., payoff) at their current location (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>). Movement towards the resource center was indicated by increasingly higher values and deeper reds on the resource detector. At the beginning of the experiment, the resource was placed in the center of the arena and participants were initialized on the resource facing its center.</p><p>The study was implemented using the Unity game engine, version 2021.3.14f1 (Unity Technologies, 2021) and compiled to run in a web browser using WebGL technology. PlayFab (Mi-crosoft Corporation, 2023) provided the game server responsible for synchronizing the participants. Communication between the client and the server was handled by the Mirror Unity package (Vis2K, 2023). Participant data was recorded locally and uploaded to the PlayFab server at the end of the experiment for the alone condition. For the group conditions, data was recorded on the PlayFab game server, alongside the resource traces.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data</head><p>At a sampling interval of 10 Hz, we recorded the positions (i.e., x-and z-coordinates) of the resource center and participants' avatars, the rotations (around the y-axis) of participants' avatars, the scores that participants received at each time step, and whether or not the participants were sharing their payoffs at that moment (in the Voluntary Payoff-Sharing condition).</p><p>From this raw data, we reconstructed the movement trajectories and visual information of each participant using Python 3.9 (Van Rossum &amp; Drake, 2009) and Python libraries numpy <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Harris et al., 2020</ref><ref type="bibr">), pandas (McKinney, 2010)</ref>, and xarray <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Hoyer &amp; Hamman, 2017)</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dynamic visibility network analysis</head><p>To analyze the structure of social interactions, we constructed dynamic visibility networks for each group at each one-second interval. A participant j was considered visible to participant i if j was within i's 90 • forward-facing field of view.

From these networks, we computed two key metrics for each participant at each time step: in-degree (the number of individuals observing them) and out-degree (the number of individuals they observed). These networks were constructed and analyzed using the NetworkX Python package <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Hagberg et al., 2008)</ref>.</p><p>To analyze overall network connectivity (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3A</ref>) we applied a Bayesian Poisson regression; to analyze adaptive connectivity (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3B</ref>) we applied a Bayesian logistic regression, in both cases accounting for individual-and group-level heterogeneity.</p><p>Resource discovery events. To investigate the temporal dynamics of visibility network adaptation, we analyzed resource discovery events in which one group member, the "discoverer," discovers the resource while the other group members are searching for it (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3C</ref>). These events were characterized by a specific set of conditions: all group members were searching (i.e., were not on the resource) for at least 5 s, and exactly one participant entered the resource and stayed on it for at least 5 s. For these events, we analyzed changes in visibility and performance in the 30 s following the resource discovery event (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">S10</ref> for an illustration).</p><p>In case of overlapping events, only the first event was used. We used Gaussian process function learning through the gp function in brms <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bürkner, 2018)</ref> to estimate how visibility networks and performance changed over time for the "discoverer" and for "others."</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Computational model of rotation decisions</head><p>To better understand individual movement decisions at a mechanistic level, we developed a computational modeling framework that sequentially predicts participants' movement decisions based on a linear combination of private and social information features. Movement decisions consist of two components: rotation direction (whether participants turn clockwise or counterclockwise) and rotation magnitude (how strongly they adjust their direction). We present the analysis of rotation direction in the Supplementary Information Section S6; in the main text, we focus on rotation magnitude, which can be expressed more directly in relation to private and social information features. Although behavior was recorded at 10 Hz, for modeling purposes we discretized it into 1 s intervals. At each interval, the absolute rotation magnitude is modeled as</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">|∆θ t | ∼ Exponential(λ t ), log λ t = w 0 + f ⊤ t w,</formula><p>where f t represents the vector of private and social features observed at time t and w denotes the corresponding feature weights. The components of f t are introduced in the following subsections. The model assumes that participants integrate both types of information to decide how much to deviate from their current movement direction. This framework allows us to quantify the relative influence of different, dynamically changing private and social cues across experimental conditions (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref> for illustrations).</p><p>Private information features. The private information features capture how participants responded to changes in their own detector readings and positions relative to the resource.</p><p>These features were only present during tracking phases.</p><p>The first private information feature is the detector change (δ t ), which represents the change in distance to the resource center between consecutive time steps:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">δ t = d t -d t-1 ,</formula><p>where d t is the detector value (distance to the resource center) at time t. A negative detector change (δ t &lt; 0) indicates a decrease in distance (i.e., moving closer to the resource), while a positive detector change (δ t &gt; 0) indicates an increase in distance (i.e., moving away from the resource). According to our analytical derivation, optimal trackers should rotate more if their detector change indicates movement away from the resource center and less if the detector indicates movement towards the center (see Supplementary Information Section S4).</p><p>This feature is thus critical for tracking across experimental conditions, as it directly informs participants about performance.</p><p>The second private feature is the absolute distance to the resource center (d t ). This feature does not provide additional directional information, but it can still influence behavior, as indicated by the behavior rotation analysis (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Social information features.</head><p>The model also incorporates a set of social features that participants might use in both tracking and search phases. These features are calculated based on the average position and average direction of motion of others within the focal participant's field of view.</p><p>The first social feature is the position of others (θ pos,t ), representing the angular difference between the focal participant's heading direction and the average position of others within the field of view:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">θ pos,t = |θ group,t -θ t |,</formula><p>where θ t is the current heading direction of the focal participant and θ group,t is the angle towards the average position of visible others. Letting the participant's position be p t = (x t , y t ) and the average position of the N visible others be (x t , ȳt ), this angle is calculated as</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">θ group,t = atan2(ȳ t -y t , xt -x t ),</formula><p>Larger values indicate that others are positioned at a larger angle from the current direction of motion of the focal participant. If participants use this feature, they rotate less when others are near the center of their field of view and more when others are toward the periphery of their field of view.</p><p>The second social feature is the movement direction of others (θ mov,t ), reflecting the angular difference between the focal participant's heading direction and the average movement direction of others in the field of view:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">θ mov,t = | θm,t -θ t |,</formula><p>where θm,t is the average movement direction of others in the field of view at time t. Large values indicate that others are moving against the focal participant's current direction, while small values indicate that others are moving in the same direction as the focal participant.</p><p>This feature might serve as a proxy for others' beliefs about the location of the resource, as the observer can infer the assumed location of the resource center based on the direction others are moving in.</p><p>Social information quality. To investigate how social information quality influences participants' reliance on social cues across conditions, we included interactions of both social features with social information quality. For tracking, relative social information quality (q t ) is defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">q t = d t -do,t ,</formula><p>where d t represents the participant's distance from the resource center and do,t represents the average distance of others within the participant's field of view from the resource center. Positive values (q t &gt; 0) indicate that others are closer to the resource center, while negative values (q t &lt; 0) indicate that others are farther away from the resource center.</p><p>For searching, relative social information quality is represented as a binary variable,</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">q t ∈ {-1, 1},</formula><p>where q t = 1 indicates that the average position of others in the focal participant's field of view is on the resource at time t, and q t = -1 indicates they are not.</p><p>Note that social information quality could only be directly and consistently accessed in the FP experimental condition (via the colored beam). In the NP condition it had to be inferred.</p><p>To ensure that shared feature weights could be interpreted across conditions and to facilitate model convergence, all features were normalized to a range between [-1, 1].</p></div>

In the simulations, agents are assumed to search for and track a mobile resource, which moves according to the same Lévy-walk process used in the experiment.</p><p>Agents are assumed to move at a constant speed v, updating their position p t+1 at each time step t based on their heading angle θ t :</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">p t+1 = p t + v • ∆t • cos(θ t ) sin(θ t ) ,</formula><p>where p t = (x t , y t ) is the position at time t, and ∆t is the time step duration.

Social information is treated similarly to tracking, except that the relative quality of social information (q t ) is binarized based on whether others are on the resource (q t = 1) or not (q t = -1), as in the computational model. When not acting based on social information, the rotation magnitude is uniformly sampled from U (0, r max ) and the direction is randomly chosen. Here, r max represents the maximum rotation at each time step when the agent was searching and is set to r max = 90 • for all simulations.</p><p>S1 Supplementary Figures  <ref type="table">Table S1:</ref>         Agent-based model parameter sweep for detector sensitivity (x-axis) and social information selectivity (y-axis).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>S3 Data Collection</head><p>Data collection was conducted over three periods in 2023: April 11-12, May 3, and November 13-17. On April 11-12, data were collected for the A, NP, and FP conditions (both fast and slow). On May 3, data were collected for the VP condition (both fast and slow). Roughly half of the samples within each condition were collected in these first two periods (n = 329 participants). The remaining half of the samples in all conditions were collected from November 13-17. For each experimental condition (e.g., Full Payoff Sharing and slow resource), participants were recruited separately within a given time interval, typically 2 hours. To maximize the number of complete groups, we opened 50 slots simultaneously per experimental condition on Prolific. This number was dictated by the bandwidth capabilities of the game server. Participants could only join newly forming groups before the start of the experiment; once a session had begun, no additional participants could enter. If a participant dropped out during the experiment, this participant was not replaced. For analysis, we only included groups that finished with at least four players (see Table <ref type="table">S1</ref> for the number of groups per condition).</p><p>In total, the data collection consisted of 16 2-hour sessions on Prolific.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>S4 Optimal rotation based on private information</head><p>Here, we derive a normative model to determine the optimal rotation an agent should make based solely on the change in its distance to a moving resource (δ t ). The derivation consists of two parts.</p><p>First, a forward model calculates how the distance to the resource changes as a function of the agent's movement relative to resource. This answers the question: Given my movement, what distance change should I expect? Second, an inverse model uses Bayesian inference to invert this logic, answering the question: Given the distance change I just observed, what is the optimal way to turn?</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>S4.1 Forward model: calculating distance change</head><p>The forward model calculates the rate of change in distance ( d dt r) between an agent and a resource, given their speeds and relative orientation. We establish a reference frame that moves with the resource, with the resource's velocity vector, ⃗ v p (see Fig. <ref type="figure">S1A</ref>). The relevant variables are: The agent's constant speed (v a ); The resource's constant speed (v p ); The agent's heading, relative to the resource's direction of motion (ϕ a ); The angle of the agent's position, relative to the resource's direction of motion (ξ).</p><p>The rate of change in distance is the projection of the relative velocity vector (⃗ v a -⃗ v p ) onto the unit vector (û r ) that points from the resource to the agent.</p><p>In the resource frame of reference, the vectors are: resource velocity:</p><p>; unit vector to agent: ûr = cos(ξ) sin(ξ) . Performing the dot product:</p><p>S4.3 Inference model: inferring rotation from distance change</p><p>In the hidden resource tracking task, an agent doesn't know the true angles ξ and ϕ a ; it only observes the resulting distance change, δ t ≈ d dt r. The inverse model uses this observation to infer a probability distribution over possible optimal rotations. Using Bayes' rule, we seek the posterior probability of a rotation ψ given an observed distance change δ: P (ψ|δ). We can find this by marginalizing over the unknown (latent) angles ξ and ϕ a :</p><p>We make three simplifying assumptions. First, we assume the optimal rotation is determined by the latent angles. Once ξ and ϕ a are known, the optimal rotation ψ opt is fixed (see Eq. S9). Second, we assume conditional independence of ψ and δ given ξ and ϕ a , and therefore express P (ψ|ξ, ϕ a , δ) as following:</p><p>Third, we assume a uniform prior over angles, meaning the agent has no prior knowledge of its relative orientation, so p(ξ, ϕ a ) is a uniform distribution. Under these assumptions, Bayes' rule simplifies the posterior to:</p><p>Here, p(δ|ξ, ϕ a ) is the likelihood of observing δ given a specific orientation, which is derived from the forward model. p(ψ|ξ, ϕ a ) is the policy that executes the optimal rotation ψ opt for a given orientation and could be substituted with the expression from Eq. S9. To compute this numerically, we approximate the integral by summing over a discrete grid of N × N possible values for ξ and ϕ a :</p><p>where ∆ξ and ∆ϕ a are the steps in the discretization of the domain [-π, π] × [-π, π]. For an illustration of the inference model, see Fig. <ref type="figure">S1D</ref>-F and Fig. <ref type="figure">S2</ref> for the inference model for the different resource speeds (v p ).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>S5 Voluntary Payoff-Sharing Condition</head><p>In the Voluntary Payoff-Sharing condition, participants could decide whether to share their current payoff with group members. Sharing was initiated by pressing the space bar, which activated a visible payoff beam above the avatar, similar to the Full Payoff-Sharing condition. Once activated, sharing continued until the space bar was pressed again, with each sharing episode lasting at least one second, even if participants immediately stopped. Sharing came at a small cost of 1 point per second.</p><p>Out of 165 participants, only 12 (7.3%) never shared payoff information (2 in the slow-resource condition, 10 in the fast-resource condition). On average, participants initiated payoff sharing 6.58 times <ref type="bibr">[5.60, 7.59]</ref> in the fast-resource condition and 20.88 times <ref type="bibr">[17.79, 23.96]</ref> in the slow-resource condition (posterior estimates from a Bayesian Poisson regression). These sharing episodes corresponded to average sharing durations of 1.64 minutes [1.37, 1.91] in the fast condition and 2.24 minutes [1.90, 2.55] in the slow condition (posterior estimates from a Bayesian Beta regression), with the individual sharing for the longest period reaching 13.33 minutes.</p><p>The frequency of sharing decisions was positively associated with individual performance (Fig. <ref type="figure">S7A</ref>), and the total number of sharing decisions within a group was associated with the group's average score (Fig. <ref type="figure">S7B</ref>). Both associations were credibly stronger in the slow-resource condition. By contrast, the total time spent sharing was not reliably linked to higher scores at either the individual or group level.</p><p>We next examined payoff sharing at a more fine-grained scale by modeling the probability of sharing at one-second time steps. As expected, participants were more likely to share when tracking the resource compared to searching for it, in both the fast (0.12 [0.09, 0.14]) and slow (0.07 [0.06, 0.08]) condition (Fig. <ref type="figure">S7C</ref>). Over time, sharing became more common in the fast condition when participants were tracking (0.06 [0.04, 0.08]). Interestingly, in the slow condition participants shared payoff information more selectively compared to the fast condition, sharing less during tracking when they were far from the resource center, but equally when very close to it (Fig. <ref type="figure">S7D</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>S6 Rotation Direction Analysis</head><p>This supplementary analysis complements the rotation-magnitude results presented in the main text.</p><p>Here we ask when participants reverse their rotation direction (i) in response to changes in detector values (Fig. <ref type="figure">S16</ref>) and (ii) as a function of the spatial configuration and quality of social information (Fig. <ref type="figure">S17</ref>).</p><p>Across payoff conditions, participants changed rotation direction more often in the fast-resource condition, consistent with adaptation to higher environmental volatility. Beyond this general effect, rotation direction changes followed a simple heuristic: Keep turning in the same direction when moving toward the resource center; reverse when moving away. As in the rotation-magnitude analysis, groups were less responsive to the detector than singletons, especially while approaching the resource (Fig. <ref type="figure">S16</ref> left).</p><p>Social information was classified as aligned with rotation when it appeared in the FOV sector toward which the participant had just rotated. Figure <ref type="figure">S17</ref> shows how the probability of a rotation direction change at time t depends on social information alignment at t -1. We also distinguished between two levels of social information quality, depending on whether the observed peer was closer to (good) or farther from (bad) the resource center than the focal individual.</p><p>In all group conditions, alignment with social information lowered the chance of a rotation direction change. However, when the social information was of low quality, the probability of a rotation direction change was substantially higher than when the participant was aligned with high-quality social information. The fact that participants were sensitive to the quality of social information when it was aligned with a rotation direction change in all payoff conditions might indicate that it was simple for them to evaluate the quality of social information in this case.</p><p>When social information was not aligned with the rotation direction, rotation direction change probability increased overall. However, its interaction with social information quality differed across payoff conditions. NP groups treated high-and low-quality social information similarly, whereas FP groups changed the rotation direction more often when misaligned with high-quality social information (see Fig. <ref type="figure">S17 right)</ref>.</p><p>Taken together, decisions about rotation direction integrate private cues, the spatial alignment of social cues, and their relative quality. Payoff conditions govern sensitivity to social information quality. These patterns complement the findings reported in the main text.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>S7 Rotation Magnitude Model Random Effects Analysis</head><p>To assess the relationship between individual decision-making strategies and success, we extracted subject-level random effects (i.e., individual-specific weights) from the multilevel computational model of rotation magnitude. We then used these weights to predict behavioral outcomes. For tracking, we modeled tracking efficiency as a function of each individual's private and social weights. We modeled tracking efficiency separately for each weight using experimental conditions as fixed effects. The results are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">S18</ref> and discussed in the Results section of the main text. We repeated this analysis for rotation magnitude model of searching, using tracking time as the outcome. The results are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">S19</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>S8 Agent-Based Modeling: Interaction Between Private Sensitivity and Social Selectivity</head><p>We used the agent-based model presented in the main text to explore how private and social information use interacted in shaping performance. Fig. <ref type="figure">S20</ref> plots relative (to solitary agents) tracking time (left), tracking efficiency (center) and total score (right) for different degrees of selectivity to social information (on the x-axis) and sensitivity to the detector, i.e., changes in payoffs (on the y-axis).</p><p>Increasing detector sensitivity allows agents to rotate more optimally, with a theoretical maximum detector sensitivity of 90 degrees. Blue cells corresponds to regions in parameter space where social agents perform worse than solitary agents, red cells correspond to regions where social agents perform better. The results show that the selectivity of social information plays a larger role when social agents are imperfect individual trackers. This is particularly evident in the lower part of Fig. <ref type="figure">S20</ref> (middle panel), where agents with lower detector sensitivity tend to perform worse than singletons unless they are highly selective in their use of social information. Conversely, in the upper part of the plot -where agents have high detector sensitivity -there is no indication that social agents fall below singleton performance, even at the lowest levels of selectivity. This suggests that when agents are near-perfect individual trackers, less selective use of social information still provides a comparative performance advantage over solitary conditions. They can closely track changes in payoffs, limiting the risks of maladaptive herding and information cascades. In addition, they may benefit more from copying, as others in the group are more likely to make optimal decisions and thus provide adaptive information.</p></div>			</div>
