<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A Social Ecological Approach to Belonging in LGBTQ+ People</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>People who are sexual and gender minorities experience more physical and psychological health problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> than their cisgender and heterosexual peers, in part due to the excess stress that they experience in response to stigma <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> . The acronym LGBTQ+ is an umbrella term used to refer to sexual and gender minority individuals, including individuals who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ), with the plus sign representing other minoritized identities, sexual orientations, and behaviors that are not reflected by the acronym's named identities. By contrast, cisgender is a term that refers to people who identify as their gender assigned at birth. The scientific literature and large-scale research funding efforts have traditionally favored a differences and deficits approach that underscores dysfunction, distress, and pathology within LGBTQ+ populations <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> . However, relatively less attention has been given to what enriches life for LGBTQ+ people and the conditions that promote LGBTQ+ people's well-being, which is crucial to fully understand the psychology of sexual orientation and gender diversity <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> . As a consequence of the prevailing minority-as-deficit approach, an essential aspect of life that might both reduce health disparities and promote thriving among LGBTQ+ people has been overlooked: a sense of belonging.</p><p>Belonging refers to the psychological state of establishing a sense of positive connections to others <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> and corresponds with a positive sense of self and identity <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> (Box 1).</p><p>People acquire a strong sense of belonging through social acceptance and integration <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> .</p><p>However, belonging can vary from moment to moment and place to place. When people feel greater belonging, they perform better on tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> , express more motivation <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> , and experience mental health benefits, such as less depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">24</ref> . Given the dire costs of not belonging (including loneliness and isolation), fulfilling the need to belong has been considered on par with meeting other essential needs <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> , such as food and shelter. Indeed, when people doubt the quality of their social relationships-situations that can trigger 'belonging uncertainty' <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> -they psychologically and physiologically respond negatively <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">26</ref> . For example, feeling disconnected from others is associated with more suicide attempts <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">27</ref> , impaired cognitive functioning <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">28</ref> , and greater mortality risk <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">29</ref> , leading experts to assert that belonging is a public health priority <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">31</ref> . Belonging is measured through constructs including social belonging, belonging uncertainty, and general social connection and belongingness (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</p><p>Furthermore, it can be measured in different contexts, such as families, communities, and schools.</p><p>Like other stigmatized groups, LGBTQ+ people routinely encounter challenges to their belonging in institutions and organizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">32</ref> , through laws and policies <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">33</ref> , within communities <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">34</ref> , and among families <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">35</ref> and peers <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">36</ref> . On average, LGBTQ+ individuals experience greater loneliness and isolation than their cisgender and/or heterosexual counterparts <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">38</ref> , and initial evidence suggests that the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated such disparities by isolating</p><p>LGBTQ+ people from networks that affirm their belonging <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">39</ref> . Chronic threats to LGBTQ+ people's belonging can activate rejection sensitivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">40</ref> , perceptions of low social safety <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">41</ref> , and heighten minority stress and mental health disparities <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">42</ref> , all of which serve an explanatory role in social and health disparities (Box 2). By contrast, having a robust social network and feeling connected to one's community contribute to positive health outcomes among LGBTQ+ people across the lifespan, even in the face of adversity <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[43]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[44]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[45]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[46]</ref> . Put simply, for people to thrive, they need one another. Researchers have therefore called for greater empirical attention to belonging and other positive psychological states as pathways toward strengthening the psychological and physical health of LGBTQ+ people <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">47</ref> .</p><p>Conceptualizing belonging necessitates an understanding of how individuals relate to other people and their broader social contexts. A social ecological perspective helps conceptualize the determinants of belonging. Social ecological models are widely used and versatile frameworks to understand factors that influence health and well-being and inform health promotion programming <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[48]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[49]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[50]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[51]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[52]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[53]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[54]</ref> . These models detail risk and protective health-relevant factors at four levels-the individual, interpersonal, community, and society (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). The levels are multi-faceted and interconnected, such that multiple influential factors exist at each level and the levels inform one another in an ongoing, reciprocal process <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">53</ref> . For example, the psychological characteristics of people (individual level) can be influenced by broader social systems in which they live <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">52</ref> , and people can influence broader social systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">54</ref> .</p><p>Researchers, community leaders, and health professionals draw upon social ecological models to guide interventions at each level and to address a variety of health issues, such as community health <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">52</ref> , violence prevention <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">51</ref> , bullying and victimization <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">55</ref> , and chronic illness management <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">56</ref> . The multi-level, interactional approach is useful for examining LGBTQ+ people's well-being because it organizes and accounts for factors within each level and across levels that might strengthen or weaken belonging. Further, interventions on the primary outcome (belonging) have the best chance to succeed when multiple levels are targeted <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">53,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">54</ref> and this multi-level approach increases the likelihood of goal alignment such that interventions reinforce one another toward a shared interest <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">57,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">58</ref> . The possible effects of interventions across multiple levels operate bidirectionally <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">54,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">58,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">59</ref> : efforts made within broader systems influence more proximal systems (top-down effects), and interventions within smaller units influence social structures beyond the individual (bottom-up effects). Consequently, a cross-level approach to increase belonging simultaneously promotes the flourishing of LGBTQ+ people as individuals while critically addressing macro-level, structural forces that contribute to people's psychosocial well-being.</p><p>In this Review, we synthesize factors that contribute to LGBTQ+ people's belonging. We put forward a social ecological model of belonging to analyze how individual differences and contextual factors-from the individual to the broader society-shape belonging. First, we review factors influencing belonging at the individual level, focusing on psychological differences and sociodemographic characteristics. We then examine the interpersonal level and how relationships within families and with peers and friends might influence belonging. Finally, we examine the broader levels, community and society, to discuss the influences of neighborhood, work, and school connections on belonging, as well as the influences of laws, norms, and policies. We aim to spark new ideas for elevating belonging among LGBTQ+ people and researchers and outline future directions for researchers to consider in measurement and theory development. Previous articles cover critical factors of LGBTQ+ people's psychological health, such as rejection sensitivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">40</ref> , social safety <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">41</ref> , and experiences of stigma <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> , and previous reviews focus on the mental health of specific LGBTQ+ groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">60,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">61</ref> . Our Review is unique in integrating the social psychology of belonging so firmly with LGBTQ+ people's psychosocial well-being. Alternative versions and approaches to social ecological frameworks exist <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">62,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">63</ref> . We appreciate a social ecological model's flexibility and generality as it can accommodate various outcomes, life stages, and both positive and negative psychological experiences.</p><p>We acknowledge within-group differences among LGBTQ+ people, recognizing the multiple identities and systems of advantage and disadvantage that texturize people's experiences of their sexual orientation and gender identity. Referring to LGBTQ+ people as a single-category monolith is a flawed yet frequent feature of the psychology literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">64,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">65</ref> -one that our Review necessarily reflects. When the information is available and relevant, we specify</p><p>LGBTQ+ subgroups and use the sampling language of the original studies. The reviewed literature mostly provides a U.S. and Western perspective because that is where most of the research to date has been conducted, and we point out opportunities for expanding this research across the globe.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Individual Level</head><p>We begin with the most proximal level of the social ecological model: the individual. This section explores the diversity of LGBTQ+ people's psychological individual differences and sociodemographic characteristics associated with belonging (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Psychological Factors</head><p>Belonging varies among LGBTQ+ individuals through experiences and expectations of stigma. Prolonged exposure to stigma increases anticipation of stigma <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">41</ref> and long-term anticipatory stigma can lead to chronic threat-vigilance in which LGBTQ+ individuals alter their behaviors to protect themselves against potential threats <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">41</ref> , which can disrupt their sense of belonging <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">66</ref> . When anticipating more stigma, individuals also expect rejection from others and exhibit higher levels of rejection sensitivity or readily perceiving rejection 40 even inaccurately <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">67</ref> .</p><p>In turn, LGBTQ+ individuals with higher rejection sensitivity actively try to avoid rejection and perceive potential rejection as intentional, which might act as a self-fulfilling prophecy leading to actual rejection and ultimately impacting social belonging <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">67</ref> . Taken together, individuals who experience high anticipatory stigma, chronic threat-vigilance, and rejection sensitivity might feel less social belonging because they expect (and are sensitive to) suggestions that they do not belong.</p><p>Although the anticipated rejection experienced by LGBTQ+ individuals might hinder belonging in the general sense, stigma and discrimination can also enhance belonging to</p><p>LGBTQ+ communities <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">68</ref> . Shared adversity increases group cohesion because people often turn to other ingroup members seeking connections and people with whom they can confide <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">69,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">70</ref> and turn to the group's collective resources such as social support or advocacy to cope with adverse experiences <ref type="bibr">16,71,72 .</ref> LGBTQ+ individuals can compensate for lost feelings of belonging from the outgroup of cisgender and/or heterosexual people by strengthening their belonging to LGBTQ+ communities, and this restored sense of belonging can be protective against rejection from society at large <ref type="bibr">73,74 .</ref> LGBTQ+ individuals who believe that their sexual orientation is not a choice but rather beyond their control might feel more connection to LGBTQ+ communities because that is a prevailing ideology in LGBTQ+ communities <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">75</ref> and might reinforce the creation of a minoritized ingroup. Indeed, lesbian and gay people endorse essentialism (the belief that one's sexual orientation is given or natural) more than bisexual people do, which in turn is positively related to lesbian and gay people's greater belongingness and identification with LGBTQ+ communities <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">76</ref> .</p><p>To some extent, belonging depends on individuals' disclosure of their LGBTQ+ identity to others (whether they are 'out', Box 3). Many LGBTQ+ people weigh the benefits of disclosure and authenticity against the risk of losing belonging if they are out to unsupportive individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">70</ref> .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Some</head><p>LGBTQ+ people decide to conceal their LGBTQ+ identities to preserve their sense of belonging and avoid discrimination. Whereas some people might temporarily alter their behavior or conceal their identity in threatening situations <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">77</ref> , others might pursue long-term behavior modifications by concealing their identity in some or all aspects of their life (for example, remaining closeted at work to avoid being fired). However, individuals who conceal their identity might not feel that they belong as their authentic selves <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">78</ref> and carry an increased risk of internalizing negative views that others have about their identities 79 (internalized stigma), which is associated with worse psychological health and decreased belonging (for example, to</p><p>LGBTQ+ communities and groups of friends <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">73,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">80</ref> ). The effort and stress of managing disclosure and concealment might create a barrier to intimacy, further perpetuating belonging concerns <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">73,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">79,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">80</ref> .</p><p>Strategies to increase belonging among LGBTQ+ people include helping to manage the disclosure process and leveraging tools of social psychology to help people affirm their selfintegrity and reframe belonging concerns. Although we recognize that not all LGBTQ+ individuals value disclosure to the same extent (for example, LGBTQ+ people of color often feel tension with white LGBTQ+ communities' emphasis on being out <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">81</ref> ), providing safe spaces for disclosure might help increase belonging. Disclosure-related strategies include helping people to create positive first disclosure experiences, delaying disclosure to maximize safety, and gauging the safety of a situation to determine disclosure risks or engage in selective disclosure <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">82</ref> . Social psychological interventions can increase belonging by encouraging people to affirm their core values <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">83</ref> and by framing feelings of belonging uncertainty as transitory <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> . For example, the globally widespread It Gets Better media campaign featured LGBTQ+ individuals sharing their stories of adversity alongside messaging that adversity experiences diminished or became more manageable over time as people form meaningful social connections <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">84</ref> . Brief belonging interventions could offer a low-cost and relatively easily implemented strategy to help people consider a similar message that belonging can improve over time <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> .</p><p>Long-term LGBTQ+-affirming mental healthcare can also increase belonging by offering strategies and resources that facilitate social connections, but barriers still exist to these interventions. For LGBTQ+ individuals to access affirming mental healthcare, there must be practitioners with cultural competency for the variety of identities and experiences of the</p><p>LGBTQ+ population, including intersecting marginalized identities such as LGBTQ+ people of color. Moreover, it is crucial that healthcare practitioners can provide these services without the threat of legal action when providing gender-affirming care <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">85,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">86</ref> .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sociodemographic Factors</head><p>Despite some shared experiences among LGBTQ+ people, belonging varies by sociodemographic factors, including gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, race and/or ethnicity, and age.</p><p>Transgender individuals report higher rates of discrimination than their cisgender LGBQ+ peers, which hinders their belonging in general and within specific contexts <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">61,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">87</ref> . Furthermore, although LGBQ+ individuals might find solace in LGBTQ+ communities, transgender individuals sometimes face further exclusion within those communities <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">64,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">88,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">89</ref> . Transgender individuals who do not 'pass' as cisgender and instead are visibly transgender or gender non-conforming can feel particularly excluded from society <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">90</ref> . Both cisgender and transgender LGBTQ+ people note that non-conformity in gender expression substantially contributes to their experiences of stigma <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">91,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">92</ref> . Although being gender non-conforming can compromise belonging because it puts people at risk for heightened stigma, completely hiding one's gender identity (going 'stealth') is not possible or desirable to everyone <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">93</ref> .</p><p>Bisexual people also deal with potential ostracization from LGBTQ+ and heterosexual communities <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">94</ref> , threatening their belonging. Compared to lesbian and gay people, bisexual individuals disclose their sexual identity less frequently <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">47</ref> and feel less connected to LGBTQ+ communities <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">[95]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">[96]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">[97]</ref> . Bisexual people experience different treatment within LGBTQ+ communities depending on whether they are in same-gender or different-gender relationships. For example, a bisexual woman's belonging to the LGBTQ+ community might be questioned when she dates a cisgender man <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">98,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">99</ref> . Despite being the numeric majority of LGBTQ+ adults according to polling data <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">100</ref> , bisexual people (especially men) encounter persistent challenges to belonging in different contexts, as they might be perceived as not 'gay enough' for LGBTQ+ communities and not 'straight enough' for heterosexual ones <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">101</ref> . As a consequence of the double stigma bisexual people experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">94</ref> , they might lack the psychological benefits of belonging to</p><p>LGBTQ+ communities, which helps to explain why they experience disparate health problems compared to their heterosexual, lesbian, and gay counterparts <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> . Individuals who have multiple marginalized identities endure multiple sources of threats to their belonging. LGBTQ+ people of color might experience racism within LGBTQ+ communities and heterosexism or transphobia within their racial communities <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">102,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b104">103</ref> ; the resulting chronic feeling of being an outsider might make it difficult to identify the communities to which they belong <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">68,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b105">[104]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b106">[105]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b107">[106]</ref> . Racial-cultural factors such as religion might compound feelings of shame and betrayal surrounding sexual orientation and gender identity. For some LGBTQ+ people, religious backgrounds that are unaccepting might create discomfort or tension with belonging to families of origin and faith-based communities <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">102,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b108">107</ref> . Further, LGBTQ+ immigrants and refugees might experience additional difficulty feeling that they belong within their new community, immigrant circles, or LGBTQ+ community due to the complex intersection of identity and culture <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">108</ref> .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Most differences in experiences across</head><p>LGBTQ+ subgroups persist into older age, accompanied by ageism and unique experiences of aging while being LGBTQ+ <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b110">109</ref> . Older</p><p>LGBTQ+ individuals might feel excluded from LGBTQ+ communities and feel forced to conceal</p><p>LGBTQ+ identities from adult children or care facilities to prevent discrimination <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b111">110</ref> . Other aspects of LGBTQ+ people's personal backgrounds might weaken their sense of belonging, such as having lower socioeconomic status <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">111</ref> and living in rural areas with less access to</p><p>LGBTQ+ communities <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">112,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b114">113</ref> or within cultures less accepting of sexual and gender diversity <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b115">114</ref> .</p><p>An LGBTQ+ identity can be both a source of belonging and a roadblock to belonging.</p><p>Lesbian identity, beyond conveying romantic and/or sexual preferences for women, signifies a community and political allegiance-one that centers around women, liberation, and feminist, anti-oppressive ideologies <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">115,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b117">116</ref> . However, tensions within lesbian communities can disrupt belonging <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">115</ref> . For example, minority beliefs that the lesbian community excludes transgender people can conflict with some of the politics of lesbian women, especially among younger lesbians who desire a diverse and inclusive lesbian community <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">115,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b117">116</ref> . Further, women of color or women who have a feminine gender expression and are therefore not as readily perceived as lesbians might feel out of place in lesbian communities <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">92,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">102,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b105">104,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b116">115,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b118">117</ref> , yet their sexual orientation might prevent them from finding strong community in non-LGBTQ+ spaces. Lesbians of color might additionally experience both racial and gender barriers to belonging within white maledominated LGBTQ+ spaces <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">92,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b105">104,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b118">117</ref> .</p><p>Overall, the myriad of individual factors that might impact LGBTQ+ individuals' belonging are as diverse as the people that comprise the community. Social status hierarchies of general society recapitulate within LGBTQ+ communities, presenting a barrier to belonging for people with multiple marginalized identities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Interpersonal Level</head><p>We next address the second level of the social ecological model: the interpersonal or relational level. LGBTQ+ people might encounter interpersonal cues of non-belonging based on the quality of their close relationships, including families of origin, families of choice, and friends and peers; the quality of these relationships can strengthen or weaken how threats to belonging influence psychosocial well-being (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Families of Origin</head><p>Families of origin-the parents, siblings, or extended kin with whom one was raisedprovide a foundation for belonging and can have an enduring impact on the well-being of</p><p>LGBTQ+ adults. Unlike people who are raised within families who all share a culturally stigmatized identity (for example, people of color in a majority-white country or people from religious minority groups), LGBTQ+ individuals are typically minorities within their families of origin, most or all of whom do not share their LGBTQ+ identity. This sexual orientation and gender identity dissimilarity might cause the family unit to become a particularly salient source of belonging uncertainty and conflict <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b119">118,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b120">119</ref> . For instance, approximately 85% of gay and lesbian people describe their families' responses to their LGBTQ+ identities as complex and ambivalent, meaning that they encounter both positive and negative reactions from family <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">120</ref> .</p><p>Interviews across three generations of participants suggest that coming out to parents might yield better results for younger LGBTQ+ individuals than for older generations, but despite generational change, negative reactions such as invalidation and rejection within families are still common across age groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">119</ref> . Belonging uncertainty and the potential for negative reactions might be exacerbated among families from cultural contexts of high structural stigma and greater collectivism, who might be more likely to view a sexual minority identity as a form of disrespect or betrayal <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">114,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b122">121</ref> . Among LGBTQ+ people, rejection and low support from parents correlates with negative psychological health including loneliness and depression <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">122,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b124">123</ref> , houselessness risk <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b125">124</ref> , and suicidal ideation <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">125</ref> . A lower sense of belonging is likely one mechanism that leads to these outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">66,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b127">126</ref> . Further, strain within parent-child relationships shapes the trajectory of psychological distress in young adulthood for LGBTQ+ individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b128">127</ref> and plays a role in explaining sexual minority women's alcohol abuse later in life <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">128</ref> .</p><p>Research focuses more on negative than positive influences of family <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">129</ref> , but specific factors within families also enhance belonging and protect against threats to belonging at different levels. For example, positive family dynamics can be protective <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">123,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b131">130</ref> . Greater family belonging is associated with less emotional distress <ref type="bibr" target="#b132">131</ref> and more self-acceptance <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">132</ref> among sexual minority youth. Although disclosing LGBTQ+ identity might place youth at heightened risk of family rejection, some LGBTQ+ individuals who come out to their parents experience less belonging uncertainty than those who continue to conceal their sexual orientation <ref type="bibr" target="#b134">133,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b135">134</ref> . Growing acceptance and reduced prejudice toward sexual diversity <ref type="bibr" target="#b136">135</ref> among individual family members can be safe havens for LGBTQ+ people to cope with threats encountered in other contexts.</p><p>Similarly, continuing to elevate examples of positive and loving families of LGBTQ+ children, such as through media or awareness efforts by organizations, might be a point of intervention for normalizing family support for LGBTQ+ individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">122</ref> .</p><p>The influence of family dynamics beyond the parent-child bond on belonging is a promising area for future work. For example, Black gay men, bisexual men, and men who have sex with men 106 might turn to extended kin for social support, even when experiencing rejection within the nuclear family. When studying the role of siblings, other reviews <ref type="bibr" target="#b138">137,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b139">138</ref> have noted a strong research focus on sibling comparisons with LGBTQ+ individuals and predictors or sexual orientation etiology or heterosexual siblings' acceptance. However, the interpersonal dynamics between siblings that contribute to belonging have received less attention. Interviews with</p><p>LGBTQ+ adults characterize how different sibling bonds carry different implications for family belonging <ref type="bibr" target="#b140">139</ref> . Whereas some LGBTQ+ individuals reported solidarity with siblings, which would reinforce and bolster feelings of belonging, others reported conflictual bonds that exacerbate problems within parents and extended family dynamics and ultimately compromise belonging.</p><p>Further, some LGBTQ+ people experience tangential bonds with siblings-defined by distant and low impact relationships-that likely do little to benefit belonging. Compared to heterosexual adults, lesbian, gay and bisexual adults are less close to their siblings, as measured by having less frequent contact and greater geographic distance between them <ref type="bibr" target="#b141">140</ref> .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Families of Choice Including Romantic Partners</head><p>Another source of belonging for LGBTQ+ individuals is their families of choice, defined as the loving, caring, and supportive relationships that they build beyond families of origin <ref type="bibr" target="#b142">141</ref> .</p><p>These constructed families reject the normative, biological family unit and function as places of refuge, often to compensate for a lack of belonging with families of origin <ref type="bibr" target="#b143">142</ref> . Indeed, peer social support and friendships buffer the impact of negative dynamics within families of origin <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">123,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b143">142,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b144">143</ref> .</p><p>The history of LGBTQ+ people creating chosen families includes practices such as adopting parental figures within LGBTQ+ family or house cultures, using language like 'sister' or 'mother' to denote close others, or establishing neighborhoods and housing together <ref type="bibr" target="#b145">144,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b146">145</ref> . These relationships provide deeper support than an average friendship but might be overlooked or dismissed in research and clinical practices when inquiring about supportive 'family,' given the discrepancy between what is traditionally considered 'family' and the more expansive interpretation in chosen families.</p><p>Close friends and communities of choice provide a unique sense of belonging across the lifespan in part because they are often the first and most supportive people LGBTQ+ youth disclose to <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">132,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b144">143,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b146">145</ref> and they respond to physical and emotional needs of care in older adulthood <ref type="bibr" target="#b147">146,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b148">147</ref> . Families of choice and relationship partners might provide a stronger support for LGBTQ+ people than families of origin across life stages <ref type="bibr" target="#b149">148,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b150">149</ref> . LGBTQ-focused settings, like Cherry Grove 150 (a historically LGBTQ+ beach enclave in the U.S.) or LGBTQ+-centered retirement communities, provide space for LGBTQ+ people to interact with similar others and foster the important relationships that they enjoy with one another. Some of the relationships that accompany families of choice might not be strictly platonic. As with cisgender and heterosexual people, healthy romantic and sexual relationships provide LGBTQ+ individuals with deep connections and sense of belonging. For example, in older age, living with a romantic partner is associated with less loneliness <ref type="bibr" target="#b152">151</ref> -highlighting the importance of eliminating discriminatory policies against living arrangements for same-sex partners in care facilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b153">152</ref> . For LGBTQ+ people, the mere pursuit of romantic and sexual same-sex partners can affirm their LGBTQ+ identities and facilitate belonging to LGBTQ+ communities <ref type="bibr" target="#b154">153,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b155">154</ref> . Members of minoritized groups tend to seek out interactions with other people who are also members of minoritized groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b156">155,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b157">156</ref> , and for LGBTQ+ people one way to satisfy that quest for belonging is to form romantic, sexual, and platonic relationships within</p><p>LGBTQ+ communities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Friendships and Peer Relations</head><p>Authentic, deep friendships take time to develop but pay dividends in terms of how they promote belonging with peers <ref type="bibr" target="#b158">157</ref> . Establishing trusting and caring relationships, even with just one or two people, can have a profound impact on people's social belonging <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> . Compared to cisgender and/or heterosexual individuals, LGBTQ+ people uniquely benefit from their close relationships with one another because they face exclusion in broader society, and these friendships can also be support systems for sexual identity development <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">115</ref> . For example, when lacking family and social systems for care, immigrant Latinx transgender individuals might turn to neighbors and friends as sources of safety and belonging to cope with transphobia and xenophobia <ref type="bibr" target="#b159">158</ref> . Further, transgender people and people whose gender identity or expression differs from cultural norms and expectations for their sex assigned at birth report that their sense of belonging was more enhanced by their friendships with other LGBTQ+ people than with cisgender and/or heterosexual friends <ref type="bibr" target="#b160">159</ref> . Beyond in-person dynamics, online connections also foster belonging by providing community and friendship <ref type="bibr" target="#b161">160</ref> . LGBTQ+ youth, more than their cisgender-heterosexual peers, perceive their online connections as important <ref type="bibr" target="#b162">161</ref> . Online connections can be particularly useful when in-person connections for LGBTQ+ people are strained, such as during the COVID-19 pandemic <ref type="bibr" target="#b163">162</ref> , or when living in regions with high stigma <ref type="bibr" target="#b164">163</ref> .</p><p>By contrast, whether in-person or online, LGBTQ+-based microaggressions <ref type="bibr" target="#b165">[164]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b166">[165]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b167">[166]</ref> and negative relationships with peers threaten belonging. Peer victimization of LGBTQ+ youth, including direct or indirect aggressive behavior based on sexual orientation and gender identity, reduces LGBTQ+ students' sense of school belonging and overall health <ref type="bibr" target="#b168">[167]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b169">[168]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b170">[169]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b171">[170]</ref> . When LGBTQ+ students do not feel that they belong at school or face peer victimization, they might experience greater psychological distress than cisgender and/or heterosexual students <ref type="bibr" target="#b132">131</ref> or even contemplate suicide or die by suicide <ref type="bibr" target="#b172">171,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b173">172</ref> .</p><p>Close relationships play a pivotal role in the belonging of LGBTQ+ people and different relationships contribute to different domains of belonging. For example, a person might lack belonging in their family of origin but find belonging in their family of choice. Likewise, an</p><p>LGBTQ+ young adult who experiences low belonging in school might partially find relief by finding and fitting into social networks online. Regardless of the domain, strong and positive interpersonal relationships provide benefits for LGBTQ+ individuals across the lifespan, and such relationships should be facilitated to reinforce LGBTQ+ people's sense of belonging.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Community level</head><p>Next, we identify factors within the community level. In this section, we review the influences of communities, neighborhoods, schools, and workplaces on LGBTQ+ people's belonging. These external contexts shape people's sense of identity and group membership, which ultimately impact their psychological health <ref type="bibr" target="#b174">173</ref> (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Communities and Neighborhoods</head><p>LGBTQ+ people often turn to LGBTQ+ communities (their gender identity and/or sexual orientation ingroup) and outgroup allies for social support, noting that a strength of being</p><p>LGBTQ+ is the feeling of ingroup community belonging that accompanies their gender identity and/or sexual orientation <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b175">174</ref> . A sense of belonging to a community contributes to more positive health for LGBTQ+ individuals, both physical (for instance, decreased smoking rates, less use of illicit drugs, and less engagement in high-risk sexual activities) and mental (for instance, reduced distress and increased well-being) compared to cisgender and/or heterosexual people <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">70,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b176">[175]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b177">[176]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b178">[177]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b179">[178]</ref> . The degree to which LGBTQ+ people feel connected to LGBTQ+ communities (community connectedness) is related to their belonging and other psychological outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">96,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">97,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b175">174</ref> . For example, rural LGBTQ+ youth experience less loneliness to the extent they feel like they belong to the LGBTQ+ community <ref type="bibr" target="#b180">179</ref> . Similarly, LGBTQ+ individuals report greater sociopolitical involvement <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">105,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b181">180</ref> , and LGBTQ+ adults feel more positive identification with being LGBTQ+, as they experience higher connectedness <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b175">174</ref> .</p><p>Transgender and nonbinary individuals also experience improved mental and physical health from finding community connection with other transgender individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b182">181</ref> . The proliferation of gender, sex, and sexual identities that challenge traditional binaries (for example, the increased recognition of non-binary, gender fluid, and intersex individuals) presents an opportunity for LGBTQ+ individuals to connect with other community members who might not feel included in mainstream society <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">92,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b183">182,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b184">183</ref> , and social media could assist these connections.</p><p>Researchers therefore recommend that interventions address knowledge and skills that will help individuals find and solidify connections to LGBTQ+ communities <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> .</p><p>Rejection from ingroup members impedes belonging and strong community relationships.</p><p>When people fail to develop a sense of ingroup belonging, they might lack access to collective resources to cope with discrimination, experience intraminority stress (stress stemming from dynamics within one's minority community), and report more psychological distress <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">68,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">70,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b156">155,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b185">184</ref> .</p><p>Otherwise-marginalized LGBTQ+ people might have particular difficulties in achieving ingroup belonging because they experience stigma within and beyond LGBTQ+ groups. For example, Black gay and bisexual men can experience racial microaggressions in white lesbian, gay and bisexual communities and are expected to adopt the cultural norms and values of white people to fit into the community <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">103</ref> . LGBTQ+ women of color describe a general feeling of being left out, not having sufficient space as an LGBTQ+ person of color, and experiencing alienation in predominantly white LGBTQ+ spaces <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">104,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b116">115,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b181">180</ref> . Such experiences challenge these individuals' belonging to white LGBTQ+ communities and make it less likely for them to benefit from community belonging.</p><p>LGBTQ+ people tend to favor ingroup friendship networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b157">156,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b186">185</ref> . However, not all connections to LGBTQ+ communities have a positive influence on well-being. Ingroup peer group socialization pressures might uniquely contribute to health disparities independently and/or indirectly from minority stress. LGBTQ+ communities are prone to more permissive norms around high-risk health behaviors like alcohol, tobacco, and substance use and sex work <ref type="bibr" target="#b182">181,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b187">[186]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b188">[187]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b189">[188]</ref> , which might create pressure within the ingroup to engage in these behaviors to enhance acceptance and belonging (Box 2).</p><p>High-profile community trauma events (for example, hate crimes such as the mass shooting at the gay nightclub Pulse in Orlando, Florida in 2016) might strengthen or weaken different types of belonging for LGBTQ+ people, but psychological research in this area is scarce. On one hand, community-level trauma could strengthen feelings of belonging to the ingroup: focus groups with LGBTQ+ students suggested an increase in ingroup pride and belonging in the wake of the Pulse nightclub tragedy <ref type="bibr" target="#b190">189</ref> . Likewise, interviews with LGBTQ+ participants uncovered a link between community and activism, such that community trauma motivated greater social justice work and engagement with LGBTQ+ communities among older</p><p>LGBTQ+ adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b181">180</ref> . On the other hand, a sense of belonging to society at large could be weakened by traumatic events <ref type="bibr" target="#b191">190</ref> , especially if public outcry, support, and resources are lacking.</p><p>For example, after the Pulse nightclub shooting, LGBTQ+ people reported concerns about their safety and that of their peers <ref type="bibr" target="#b192">191</ref> .</p><p>In addition to identity-related communities, physical communities (including neighborhoods or 'gayborhoods'an area where LGBTQ+ people live or frequent) shape belonging. Warm and welcoming LGBTQ+ community climates, such as neighborhoods with inclusive recreational opportunities, are associated with positive belonging-related outcomes <ref type="bibr">192- 195</ref> . Notably, sexual minority adolescents living in areas with more LGBTQ+-inclusive places of worship, health clinics, housing services, and Pride events report less substance use than their counterparts living in areas with fewer of these resources <ref type="bibr" target="#b197">196</ref> . By contrast, areas that lack vibrant</p><p>LGBTQ+ communities or ignore or overlook LGBTQ+ people's experiences hinder connections with others and perceived inclusion <ref type="bibr" target="#b198">197</ref> . Even the most seemingly LGBTQ+-friendly neighborhoods might not foster the general belonging of LGBTQ+ people if broader structural protections do not exist; we return to this issue in the Societal level section.</p><p>The gentrification of LGBTQ+ neighborhoods and places of leisure poses a threat to community members' sense of belonging and connectedness. Soaring housing prices, especially in LGBTQ+-friendly metropolitan areas, leave community members with no choice but to move from social hubs for LGBTQ+ individuals or face houselessness <ref type="bibr" target="#b181">180,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b199">198</ref> . The effects of gentrification are particularly pronounced for individuals from racial and/or ethnic minority, low-income, and other disadvantaged backgrounds, further exacerbating their disparate access to resources and support within the LGBTQ+ community <ref type="bibr">180,198 .</ref> LGBTQ+ individuals are also disproportionately less able than their cisgender heterosexual counterparts to recover from natural disasters and access resources <ref type="bibr" target="#b200">199</ref> , which can displace their communities and places of belonging. Although the use of online discussion forums and social networking platforms can combat the negative effects of physical exclusion for LGBTQ+ individuals and play a role in the identity formation and community-building of LGBTQ+ youth <ref type="bibr" target="#b201">200</ref> , not everyone has equal access to technology or can reap the benefits of virtual communication. For example, LGBTQ+ older adults might not have access to technological devices or might experience difficulty navigating social media sites due to disabilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b202">201,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b203">202</ref> .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Schools and Workplaces</head><p>To complete our analysis of community factors, we focus on two places in which people spend a substantial amount of time: schools and workplaces. School belonging plays a notable role in the link between victimization and negative adjustment (for example, depressive symptoms, academic difficulties, substance use) <ref type="bibr" target="#b171">170,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b204">[203]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b205">[204]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b206">[205]</ref> . Primary schools can strengthen the belonging of LGBTQ+ youth by implementing LGBTQ+-inclusive climate interventions (such as anti-discrimination policies) <ref type="bibr" target="#b207">[206]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b208">[207]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b209">[208]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b210">[209]</ref> , through policies protecting against discrimination, workshops to combat microaggressions, and LGBTQ+ programming in the curriculum <ref type="bibr" target="#b158">157,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b210">[209]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b211">[210]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b212">[211]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b213">[212]</ref> . Diversity and inclusion centers on university campuses enhance LGBTQ+ students' belonging by providing a safe space where they can authentically express themselves and connect with others through social events <ref type="bibr" target="#b211">210,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b212">211</ref> . Moreover, favorable perceptions of a college or university's diversity climate are positively associated with belonging among LGBTQ+ students <ref type="bibr" target="#b214">213</ref> . For</p><p>LGBTQ+ youth, school opportunities outside of the classroom, like sports and extracurricular activities, also promote belonging by offering structured time to connect with peers <ref type="bibr" target="#b215">214</ref> . Despite these benefits, the implementation of LGBTQ+-friendly clubs and diversity and inclusion trainings might encounter barriers, such as legislative restrictions or constraints on funding allotments to these initiatives <ref type="bibr" target="#b216">215,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b217">216</ref> .</p><p>Stigma within school climates threatens belonging. Sexual minority university students who perceive their schools as less safe feel less belonging and both perceptions relate to psychological health problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b213">212,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b214">213</ref> . Further, the assumption that everyone is or should be cisgender (known as cisnormativity) within education systems might create unsupportive environments for transgender children, leading to higher rates of dropping out of primary and secondary school <ref type="bibr" target="#b218">217</ref> . Students who disclose their LGBTQ+ identity to trustworthy, accepting staff members and peers at school can feel greater belonging than those who encounter negative reactions or conceal their identities <ref type="bibr" target="#b219">218</ref> . Individuals who are formal and informal sources of support at school can play a substantial role as advocates for LGBTQ+ youth (for example, reporting instances of bullying or ensuring that others respect students' pronouns) and create safe spaces for them.</p><p>Workplaces are another community with implications for belonging. Nondiscrimination policies, support for LGBTQ+-inclusive activities, and diversity trainings within the workplace correlate with more disclosure and less perceived job discrimination, which can lead to increased belonging in the workplace <ref type="bibr" target="#b220">219,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b221">220</ref> . Recognizing sexual orientation and gender identity at work, rather than trying to distance LGBTQ+ issues from the workplace or bifurcate people's worker identities and LGBTQ+ identities, can also instill belonging <ref type="bibr" target="#b222">221,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b223">222</ref> . Further, the implementation of workplace diversity trainings and allyship networks effectively enhances employee well-being and belonging <ref type="bibr" target="#b224">223</ref> .</p><p>Whereas practices that acknowledge and celebrate sexual and gender diversity likely facilitate belonging, other workplace features or inauthentic gestures can lessen belonging. For example, 'rainbow washing' describes a business's inauthentic display of support for LGBTQ+ people <ref type="bibr" target="#b225">224,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b226">225</ref> . Sudden support for the LGBTQ+ community through rainbow imagery across offices and corporate social media accounts might be performative and for profit, and such manipulative branding tactics might deter LGBTQ+ consumers and employees alike, potentially reducing feelings of belonging. Similarly, companies that present diversity initiatives as a case for good business-rather than about fairness-lessen LGBTQ+ people's belonging and interest in working at such companies <ref type="bibr" target="#b227">226</ref> . Although there is some research about threats to LGBTQ+ people's belonging at work, the literature for identifying positive predictors of LGBTQ+ people's workplace belonging is relatively nascent and needs more attention.</p><p>Community-level belonging is influenced by the groups to which one belongs, neighborhoods, schools, and workplaces. Although a strong sense of connection and contact with LGBTQ+ communities might enhance belonging, marginalized individuals often face barriers to inclusion within LGBTQ+ communities and therefore are at risk of feeling low belonging within these spaces. The gentrification of LGBTQ+ neighborhoods, stigma within educational and workplace settings, and widescale LGBTQ+-relevant traumatic incidents underscore how characteristics of public places and events and one's sense of belonging are linked. Creating inclusive and supportive environments fosters a sense of belonging for</p><p>LGBTQ+ individuals, which in turn might enhance the overall health of LGBTQ+ people.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Societal Level</head><p>We finally review factors within the broadest layer of the social ecological model: the societal level. This level includes sociocultural norms and policies that can enhance LGBTQ+ people's belonging (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Situational Cues and Norms</head><p>One increasingly common social norm is the use of identity safety cues or features of social situations to communicate that LGBTQ+ identities are valued and that anti-LGBTQ+ discrimination is limited <ref type="bibr" target="#b225">224,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b228">[227]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b229">[228]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b230">[229]</ref> . Used by communities, organizations, and businesses, identity safety cues signal that an organizational culture or context is welcoming to minoritized groups.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>For example, cities like Atlanta and London paint crosswalks in rainbow colors to mark</head><p>LGBTQ+-friendly environments and celebrate LGBTQ+ pride, and companies like IBM encourage employees to share their pronouns in email signatures and meetings to avoid microaggressions and to model inclusive norms for sexual and gender diversity.</p><p>Effective safety cues that contribute to stigmatized groups' sense of belonging include the representation or presence of other people from under-represented groups, inclusive features in the environment, diversity statements, and positive information that is communicated about one's identity <ref type="bibr" target="#b225">224</ref> . For instance, the presence of LGBTQ+ patients in online studies of healthcare settings suggests to other LGBTQ+ people that they would be welcomed in that setting <ref type="bibr" target="#b231">230</ref> . LGBTQ+-related objects online and in person act as environmental features that foster LGBTQ+ people's belonging, such as the rainbow-flag profile filter on Facebook 231 . As another example of safety cues, diversity statements and identity-safe information can be activated in university classrooms by providing a commitment to diversity and inclusive information on a syllabus 232 . In addition, language communicates expectations for belonging.</p><p>The use of preferred words to describe LGBTQ+ people, like 'lesbian' and 'gay' rather than 'homosexual', inspires greater perceived belonging among lesbian and gay people 233 . Similarly, when people explicitly share their pronouns at work (for example, by including their preferred pronouns in an email signature) LGBTQ+ people feel greater organizational commitmentincluding belonging, organizational pride, and feeling cared forthan when pronouns are not present <ref type="bibr">234,</ref><ref type="bibr">235</ref> . Safety cue interventions could be a low-effort and cost-effective strategy to promote belonging across many contexts to strengthen belonging in society, communities, and interpersonal interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b225">224</ref> .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Laws and Policies</head><p>Law and policy form another societal-level context that influences LGBTQ+ people's belonging. Implementing LGBTQ+-friendly laws and lessening anti-LGBTQ+ laws can strengthen belonging. Laws that jeopardize or restrict LGBTQ+ people's rights are a source of structural stigma, defined as societal-level conditions that impact stigmatized groups by constraining opportunities, resources, and their well-being 236 . In the U.S., the election of Donald</p><p>Trump in 2016 was associated with more stress, daily discrimination, depression, vigilance to threat, and concern about safety among LGBTQ+ people <ref type="bibr" target="#b137">136,</ref><ref type="bibr">237,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b232">238</ref> , compared to cisgender and/or heterosexual people and compared to previous self-reported distress <ref type="bibr" target="#b137">136</ref> . Similarly, lesbian, gay, and bisexual people living in U.S. states that lack protective policies for LGBTQ+ people <ref type="bibr" target="#b233">239</ref> and/or ban same-sex marriage <ref type="bibr" target="#b234">240</ref> experience more psychiatric disorders (such as generalized anxiety and mood disorders) compared to lesbian, gay, and bisexual people living in supportive states and heterosexual people. A 2008 California law that restricted marriage to heterosexual people, called 'Proposition 8,' was associated with an increase in homophobic bullying among LGBTQ+ adolescents in the period immediately before and during the passing of the law (2008-2009) compared to prior years (2001-2007)  <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">36</ref> . This finding further supports the link between stigma-based politics and day-to-day discrimination that weakens individuals' belongingness. Notably, the impact of Proposition 8 on the lives of LGBTQ+ people started before the law was enacted, during the preceding campaign for a marriage ban <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b235">241</ref> . However, some lesbian, gay and bisexual Californians felt that the upcoming vote brought them much closer to others, especially other lesbian, gay and bisexual people, via increased social support and reduced conflict <ref type="bibr" target="#b235">241</ref> . Although the analysis did not identify meaningful individual differences that explained how the policy differently impacted relationships, it made clear that policy matters for people's psychological sense of connection.</p><p>Research across psychology, public health, sociology, and public policy conveys that laws and policies that protect LGBTQ+ people's rights enhance their psychological and social well-being <ref type="bibr" target="#b236">242</ref> . Suicide attempts among sexual minority youth decreased by 7% when U.S. states passed policies protecting same-sex marriage <ref type="bibr" target="#b237">243</ref> , and living in states with fewer antidiscrimination policies was associated with greater physical and mental health risks among</p><p>LGBTQ+ older adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b238">244</ref> . Likewise, when the U.S. Supreme Court granted same-sex marriage nation-wide, LGBTQ+ people's psychological distress decreased and life satisfaction increased compared to rates prior to the ruling <ref type="bibr" target="#b239">245</ref> , and people within the U.S. perceived supporting</p><p>LGBTQ+ people and their rights as increasingly normative <ref type="bibr" target="#b240">246</ref> .</p><p>Geography provides the foundation for the laws and policies that LGBTQ+ people face.</p><p>For instance, as of March 2023, 1 in 10 transgender youth in the U.S. live in areas that ban transgender-affirming care <ref type="bibr" target="#b241">247</ref> . There are increasing political attacks on spaces and activities in which transgender people find community with others, such as drag shows and sports <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">43</ref> . Using a coding scheme based on the ratio of affirming versus exclusionary proposed bills about gender identity <ref type="bibr" target="#b242">248</ref> , researchers found that transgender and gender non-conforming people who live in affirming areas experience greater belonging than those living in other areas. However, research that directly explores the links between transgender affirming laws and belonging is limited <ref type="bibr" target="#b242">248</ref> .</p><p>LGBTQ+-friendly policies also coincide with belonging-related outcomes, often measured as health and well-being. However, societal-level factors that promote belonging tend to focus on highly visible LGBTQ+ people (such as young people) and issues (such as marriage equality), sometimes overlooking pressing issues of belonging among people who are multiplymarginalized and therefore might experience compounded and unique experiences of stigma.</p><p>LGBTQ+ people of color, individuals experiencing homelessness, and immigrants and refugees have distinct connection points to the societal level that might diminish their sense of belonging, including tense and hostile relationships with police <ref type="bibr" target="#b243">249</ref> , insufficient treatment or access to public services <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">34</ref> , and/or immigration-related barriers and concerns <ref type="bibr" target="#b159">158,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b233">239,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b244">250,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b245">251</ref> . LGBTQ+ people's belonging concerns also might become heightened in older age when encountering heteronormative assumptions within care-providing facilities, housing discrimination, and other stressors. For example, LGBTQ+ older adults might feel that care-providing institutions force them to either conceal their identity (re-enter the closet ) or ignore their LGBTQ+ identity entirely, which contribute to older adults' belonging uncertainty <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">110</ref> . Although the link between policy and belonging is evident in some research, the literature often lacks nuance in teasing apart which policies matter most for belonging and for whom. This final level of our social ecological model for belonging comprises factors that characterize societal and cultural dynamics, such as norms, policies, and laws. These higherorder societal structures create a sociocultural context that promotes or impedes belonging.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Interdependence and Intersectionality</head><p>We reviewed factors that can promote or hinder a sense of belonging among LGBTQ+ people separately according to levels for conceptual clarity, but these levels are interdependent <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">62</ref> . Change at any point in a social system has the potential to reverberate and induce ongoing reciprocal changes across system levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">58,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b246">252</ref> . For instance, over time, societal level policies can promote downstream change at the community, interpersonal, and individual levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">62</ref> . New generations of people who have formative experiences and expectations based on more inclusive policies might come to expect further change, creating upwards pressures in an ongoing reciprocal cross-level dynamic. This dynamic process over time is key to an ecological framework.</p><p>Factors that increase a sense of belonging among LGBTQ+ people at the individual level can ultimately lead to broader societal change <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">54</ref> . Although we recognize that disclosure is not safe or desirable for all LGBTQ+ individuals, LGBTQ+ people who disclose their sexual or gender identity can alter interpersonal-level and community-level dynamics in ways that spread to society <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">82</ref> . For instance, changes in public opinion, influenced in part by the micro-decisions of individual people to disclose their LGBTQ+ identity (at increasingly younger ages <ref type="bibr" target="#b247">253</ref> ), ultimately contributed to marriage equality becoming a legal right across the U.S. <ref type="bibr" target="#b248">254,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b249">255</ref> , which fostered a more hospitable social and legal environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">121</ref> . This example demonstrates how efforts to promote belonging and inclusion at any level have the potential to help generate change across levels.</p><p>The social ecological model's interlocking levels for understanding belonging also work well for considering intersectionality theory, given that both perspectives emphasize how individuals and broader systems coexist. Intersectionality theory emerged from decades of Black women's theorizing about their lives and social locations in hierarchy <ref type="bibr" target="#b250">[256]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b251">[257]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b252">[258]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b253">[259]</ref> . An intersectional analysis addresses social forces (such as power, systems and structures, oppression, liberation) as well as the influences of multiple intersecting identities <ref type="bibr" target="#b254">260,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b255">261</ref> . It also emphasizes social and political action toward justice and social change <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">65,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b256">262,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b257">263</ref> . Given the diversity of identities and social systems that characterize LGBTQ+ people's lives, an intersectional approach advances the psychology of sexual orientation and gender diversity from a study of white, cisgender, middle-class, urban, young sexual minority people to one that acknowledges within-group differences and structural intersectional oppression <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">65,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b254">260</ref> .</p><p>An advanced social ecological model can integrate intersectionality theory to yield specific facilitators and barriers to belonging for different groups of LGBTQ+ people, focusing on how a positive sense of belonging is supported at different levels. Psychologists most often employ intersectionality theory to account for dynamic, multiple negative experiences of stigma, leaving its potential for identifying positive aspects of experience or strengths largely unaddressed <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b104">103</ref> . The histories of LGBTQ+ life carry trauma and oppression but also are often rich in pleasure and fun, performance, art and culture, and families of support and love.</p><p>LGBTQ+ people find and create joy in their social connections with others, despite prevailing stigma. For instance, LGBTQ+ people of color can draw belonging from various identity-based sources, such as working toward racial justice with LGBTQ+ and heterosexual people of color, socializing and organizing within LGBTQ+ communities, and finding solidarity and advocating for spaces designed for LGBTQ+ people of color <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">81</ref> . Embracing the sociopolitical potential of their identities and leaning into communities of similar others can heighten belonging while promoting social change and disrupting oppression. As researchers begin to examine the positive and functional aspects of LGBTQ+ experiences from an intersectional perspective and how they contribute to belonging, the roles of power and oppression still must be held central (for an exemplar of such an approach see <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">92</ref> ).</p><p>At the societal level, intersectional perspectives recognize that some LGBTQ+ subgroups gain less than others from interventions that target sexual orientation and gender diversity but do not address racism, classism, and sexism <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">65</ref> . For example, LGBTQ+ advocacy groups should incorporate broader sociopolitical issues into their missions (such as racism, health care, reproductive justice, houselessness) to foster a sense of community belonging and engagement from a more diverse population of LGBTQ+ individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b181">180</ref> . Intersectionality-Based Policy Analysis offers a promising strategy for ensuring that policies that serve one group do not exacerbate a problem for another <ref type="bibr" target="#b257">263,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b258">264</ref> . For example, participation in LGBTQ+-inclusive organizations nurtures the belonging of some LGBTQ+ students but might create added stress and conflict for students who experience biphobia, transphobia, or racism within LGBTQ+ organizations, or who fear that LGBTQ+ visibility would lead to losing current support systems (such as cultural-based or faith-based groups). Engagement with intersectionality theory can therefore equip researchers to consider influences across levels and monitor unintended consequences of seemingly positive efforts toward belonging intervention.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary and Future Directions</head><p>Answering the call for research to focus on determinants of LGBTQ+ people's positive psychological experiences <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> , in this Review we highlighted the factors that strengthen or weaken belonging (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>). At the individual level, belonging among LGBTQ+ people is influenced by various psychological factors and social identities that vary from person to person, reflecting the diverse nature of LGBTQ+ people as a group. At the interpersonal level, LGBTQ+ people's close relationships substantially impact belonging, with family and peers playing strong roles in belonging across the lifespan. Community factors of belonging emerge from the inclusive and supportive groups that LGBTQ+ individuals associate with, and LGBTQ+-affirming norms, laws, and policies create conditions that bolster LGBTQ+ people's sense of belonging.</p><p>Throughout our review of each level, we identified knowledge gaps and strategies for strengthening belonging. Our use of a multi-level framework intentionally avoids placing the burden of well-being or onus of change on individuals by attending to the higher-level factors that influence LGBTQ+ people's psychosocial well-being, such as groups and social structures.</p><p>We also emphasize the benefits of attending to interlocking systems and intersectionality in future research.</p><p>Researchers who develop time-lagged survey designs will be well positioned to examine how major positive and negative events at the societal or community levels impact individual and interpersonal outcomes for belonging. Longitudinal designs and the growing use of ecological momentary assessments with cell phone applications can be useful for tracking top-down and bottom-up processes-recognizing how individual and interpersonal experiences drive and are reflected by occurrence of major events and societal changes. Investing time and resources into assessing factors at multiple levels within the same study will pay dividends for empirically documenting the interconnected links of belonging across levels. Another productive research direction would be to explore the subversive strategies that marginalized individuals use as they contend with systematic oppression. Working within the approach of intersectionality theory, researchers should investigate how people push back upon and resist interlocking forms of oppression and how belonging is leveraged toward that end.</p><p>A major methodological challenge for future research will be to account for interlocking systems and intersectional perspectives to unlock a nuanced understanding of for whom, when, how, and under which conditions belonging is enhanced. As LGBTQ+ people make strides toward social inclusion but are faced with sociopolitical setbacks, a multi-level, multi-faceted approach to belonging offers the best chance for health and prosperity by reinforcing LGBTQ+ individuals' sense of belonging from a variety of sources.   </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Box 1. Definitional Limitations to Belonging</head><p>The concept of belonging faces unresolved definitional issues. Although specific instruments exist to measure belonging (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>), research about LGBTQ+ people's psychosocial well-being often treats belonging as a higher-order, broad construct and conflates it with similar social processes. Consequently, the literature lacks strong conceptual boundaries for belonging and is often unclear about its focus (belonging in general, at home, with friends).</p><p>Without a clear definition, it becomes challenging to determine how best to measure belonging, especially when some commonly used measures have yet to be validated with LGBTQ+ samples (including subgroups, such as white lesbian and bisexual adult women versus young</p><p>LGBTQ+ men of color).</p><p>Measurement practices for belonging vary greatly. For example, across scientific articles belonging might be measured by loneliness, isolation, rejection, support, comfort, trust, connection, and perceived inclusion. The use of the term belonging in this Review coexists with the broader definitional and methodological complexities that accompany belonging as a widely used term for psychosocial experiences. In this Review, we use a general definition of belonging (the psychological state having positive connections to others <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> ) to represent and include the broad literature that is relevant to understanding LGBTQ+ people's belonging.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Box 2. LGBTQ+ Minority Stress</head><p>Minority stress theory is the leading framework for theorizing about LGBTQ+ people's negative experiences of health <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> . An expansion of social stress theory, the minority stress model emphasizes how excess stress linked to a person's stigmatized status functions as a key mechanism in the relationship between stigma and adverse health. Uniquely, the minority stress model accounts for particular stressors associated with sexual orientation, such as internalized homophobia and concealment. Researchers have also adopted the minority stress paradigm to explain psychological experiences in the context of gender identity (for example, among transgender, non-binary, and gender diverse individuals) <ref type="bibr" target="#b264">270,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b265">271</ref> . Despite the widespread use of minority stress theory in LGBTQ+ health research, notable alternatives, extensions, and critiques exist <ref type="bibr" target="#b266">272</ref> .</p><p>The dominant focus on minority stress theory lessens innovation and uptake of other emerging stress-adjacent theories and frameworks. Some alternative theories center on the critical roles of rejection sensitivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">40</ref> and social safety <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">41</ref> . Another perspective, the Developmental Model of the Closet 121 , theorizes how a lack of access to LGBTQ+ role models and peers early in life can directly contribute to a lower sense of belonging. Researchers have also called for increased focus on psychological strengths and positive factors as aspects of</p><p>LGBTQ+ people's psychological health, which are undermined by the minority stress approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b267">273</ref> . As one example of a theory that considers psychological strengths, a historically grounded theory of LGBTQ+ genders (gender identities and gender cultures within</p><p>LGBTQ+ communities) as a psychosocial process posits that aspects of LGBTQ+ genders (such as, butch, femme, drag, chosen family and/or house units) have multiple positive functions for LGBTQ+ communities <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">92</ref> .</p><p>LGBTQ+ genders are considered the catalyst for subcultures and communities to form, which spurs a sense of belonging.
