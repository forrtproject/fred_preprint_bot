<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>As part of the current study, artificial intelligence (AI), specifically the "spoken conversation" function, will be examined in relation to teaching French as a foreign language, emphasizing oral reception, production, interaction and mediation. The authors examine the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to improve oral communicative language skills by creating individualized and interactive learning environments based on the Common Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR). Through real-time speaking, learners can improve their pronunciation, rhythm, and accuracy as well as gain knowledge of various language structures and phonetic patterns. When artificial intelligence and spoken conversation are integrated into language learning in a manner that meets the needs and proficiency levels of students, theirs' oral skills are enhanced.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Several aspects of life, including education, have been profoundly affected by rapid technological advances. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which forced educational institutions worldwide to close for an extended period of time <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Krystalli, Mavropoulou, &amp; Arvanitis, 2021)</ref>, distance education, particularly vocational training, has seen significant growth. The shift towards e-learning has highlighted the importance of effective digital tools for maintaining educational continuity and supporting language learning. It has been shown that artificial intelligence (AI) is one of the most innovative technologies in the field of education, particularly when it comes to language learning <ref type="bibr">(Mavropoulou &amp; Arvanitis, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr">Mavropoulou, 2023)</ref>. By providing learners with personalized, interactive learning opportunities, artificial intelligence can greatly enhance their language skills <ref type="bibr">(Mavropoulou &amp; Arvanitis, 2023)</ref>. As a result of AI applications, including chatbots and spoken conversation platforms <ref type="bibr">(Mavropoulou &amp; Arvanitis, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr">Jeon, 2024)</ref>, improve students' oral skills, students become more engaged, and more autonomous <ref type="bibr">(Mavropoulou &amp; Arvanitis, 2023)</ref>. As well as providing immediate feedback, interactive and personalized instruction, artificial intelligence facilitates learning in an effective manner. As a result of its advanced capabilities, artificial intelligence enables the creation of rich and diverse learning environments in which students can practice their language skills in real or simulated communication situations <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">(Zou et al., 2023)</ref>. Additionally, these technologies provide support for autonomous learning in addition to enhancing motivation and self-regulation.</p><p>Chatbots can be customised to meet the different needs of students by teachers (who play an important role in the learning process). It is important for teachers to adopt chatbots as aids and not as replacements for traditional teaching methods in order to achieve effective learning. Chatbots allow learners to take control of their language acquisition. The use of a chatbot with artificial intelligence combined with human experience is an attractive, autonomous and effective way of learning foreign languages. To date, these tools remain useful and are constantly being improved <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Haristiani et al., 2019)</ref>.</p><p>Chatbots are not intended to replace professionals in language learning. Compared to the more sophisticated artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms available today, linguistic experts have knowledge and experience. To be effective and efficient, technology-assisted language learning requires humans and chatbots to work in synergy, and this is a significant research challenge <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Hwang &amp; Chang, 2023)</ref>.</p><p>There is a lot of research on chatbots in language education, which proves that the demand in this area is greater and more immediate. According to the study, the field of research on educational chatbots is still in its infancy and is expected to grow rapidly in the future. <ref type="bibr">(Mavropoulou &amp; Arvanitis, 2023)</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Overview of Artificial Intelligence</head><p>Artificial Intelligence refers to the development of computer systems that can perform tasks that traditionally require human intelligence, such as learning, problem-solving and decision-making <ref type="bibr">(Russell &amp; Norvig, 2020)</ref>. Among the subfields of artificial intelligence are computer vision, robotics, machine learning, and natural language processing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Subsectors of Artificial Intelligence</head><p>Some subsectors of Artificial Intelligence are: Machine learning, Natural processing systems, Robotic systems and Computer vision. A fundamental component of artificial intelligence is the development of algorithms and models capable of learning from data and making predictions and decisions without explicit programming instructions <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Goodfellow, Bengio, &amp; Courville, 2016)</ref>. In machine learning, there are three types: supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning. Natural language processing systems can and do interpret, understand, and produce human speech as a technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Jurafsky &amp; Martin, 2023)</ref>. A robotic system that uses artificial intelligence in conjunction with an operating system can and will perform tasks in the real world by sensing its surroundings and making real-time decisions <ref type="bibr">(Siciliano &amp; Khatib, 2016)</ref>. Computer vision allows us to interpret and analyse images and videos gathered from the environment. Facial recognition and image analysis applications rely heavily on this technology <ref type="bibr">(Szeliski, 2021)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Applications of Artificial Intelligence</head><p>Artificial intelligence is a valuable tool that can enhance numerous aspects of our lives, including healthcare, education, autonomous vehicles, financial analysis, and customer service <ref type="bibr">(Mavropoulou et al., 2023)</ref>. Artificial intelligence is the future of language learning. It improves efficiency and effectiveness by developing personalized training programmes that provide immediate feedback to learners <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">(Woolf, 2010)</ref>. To get the most out of artificial intelligence and to exploit its benefits in education, what is needed is to grasp its core principles and potential.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.1.">Spoken conversation</head><p>This technology is also known as spoken dialogue or spoken interaction. It uses artificial intelligence to enable users to communicate naturally with computers. The system uses both natural language processing and voice recognition software to understand and respond to user commands.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.2.">Voice recognition</head><p>This technology is the process by which a computer system recognises the words spoken by a speaker. It uses artificial intelligence to enable users to converse naturally with computers. Voice recognition technology use advanced machine learning algorithms and neural networks to improve the accuracy and speed of recognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Hinton et al., 2012)</ref>. During the understanding and response to user commands, the system utilizes both natural language processing and voice recognition software.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.3.">Natural Language Processing (NLP)</head><p>Natural language processing (NLP) as a field of artificial intelligence, involves computer interaction with human languages. NLP systems analyse, understand, and produce human language in ways that are natural to users <ref type="bibr">(Jurafsky &amp; Martin, 2019)</ref>. These technologies are used to process and understand users' spoken commands and produce appropriate and understandable responses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.4.">Applications in Language Teaching</head><p>In foreign language teaching, spoken conversation can be used to practice not only the pronunciation, but it enhance oral reception, oral production and oral interaction communicative language activities. At this point, artificial intelligence comes to answer previous research gaps by researchers working on portable learning and language learning/teaching.</p><p>In a study that focused on the use and effectiveness of MALL in second and foreign language (L2) education and the potential of mobile devices as effective tools for providing language learning materials to students in terms of acquired language knowledge and skills, it showed that there is a huge potential in the field of MALL applications, but there is also inconsistency with the standards proposed by the Common European Framework, and that there is a greater need for empirical research in order to understand the potential of mall in foreign language learning.</p><p>In a more recent comparative study about Duolingo and Babbel, <ref type="bibr">Arvanitis (2019, p. 21)</ref>, points out that although learners found the language learning process very interesting and enjoyable, and consider the enjoyable features of the applications (quality of sound, graphics, audio and written rewards) to be factors of learning motivation, looking further at the communicative language skills and activities developed specifically by the Duolingo and Babbel platforms under the CEFR, we observe that they do not develop oral and written mediation, nor oral and written interaction, activities that are difficult to implement in digital environments". It also highlights the fact that "stand-alone online language learning platforms and digital applications with their pleasant nature seem to be suitable for use at low levels of language proficiency and can function as complementary and combinatorial tools in a foreign language teaching/learning process" <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Arvanitis, 2019)</ref>.</p><p>In a recent study <ref type="bibr">(Mavropoulou &amp; Arvanitis, 2023)</ref> researchers concluded that it is proven that chatbots can improve language learning. Through personalized, interactive and accessible language practice, learners can improve their proficiency and motivation. In order for chatbots to be effective, several factors such as their design, their integration into the curriculum and teachers' attitudes toward them need to be taken into account. The researchers pointed out that it is possible to adapt chatbots to meet the different needs of students from teachers, who play an important role in facilitating learning. It is important for teachers to adopt chatbots as aids and not as replacements for traditional teaching methods in order to achieve a harmonious and effective learning environment <ref type="bibr">(Mavropoulou &amp; Arvanitis, 2023)</ref>.</p><p>Integrating spoken conversation bots into MALL applications or using them independently can significantly improve learners' language skills. It comes to complement stand-alone foreign language learning applications, as the development of spoken language production is something that is missing in conjunction with the CEFR specifications. The possibility of automated recording of the conversation that will be achieved is another strong stone that comes to contribute to foreign language learning and teaching as well.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.5.">Examples of Voice Conversation Technologies</head><p>Examples of spoken conversation technologies include digital assistants. Amazon Alexa which is Amazon's voice artificial intelligence that resides in the cloud, assists users from anywhere there is internet access and a device that can connect to it. Alexa can play a song, read the latest headlines, dim the lights in the living room and more. Google Assistant which is a voice of artificial intelligence available on many devices like Google Home and Google Pixel can do things like answer questions, play games, remind upcoming events, manage a calendar and more. Apple Siri, is designed to work on Apple's system, which includes iOS, WatchOS, macOS and TvOS devices. This OS integration allows users to use Siri with a similar experience across different devices. Google Assistant and Apple Siri use voice recognition and NLP technologies to interact with users <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Hoy, 2018)</ref>. In language teaching, platforms such as Duolingo and Rosetta Stone have incorporated spoken conversation features to provide students with real-time practice and feedback opportunities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.6.">The European Common Frame of Reference for Languages (CEFR)</head><p>The European Common Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) is an important tool for language teaching and learning, providing a common system for assessing and describing language competences. The Council of Europe is establishing this organisation to guarantee transparency and consistency in language education across Europe.</p><p>The CEFR definitively sets out language proficiency levels, ranging from A1 (Beginner) to C2 (Proficient). The CEFR is made up of language activities, language skills and proficiency levels. Learners at each level of the Council of Europe (Council of Europe, 2022; Council of Europe, 2001) must demonstrate the skills that define their ability to use language effectively in a range of communicative contexts.</p><p>The CEFR is the definitive guide for developing and assessing French language curricula. Furthermore, CEFR standardization guarantees seamless collaboration and mobility of learners across Europe. The CEFR allows teachers to set clear learning objectives and adapt their teaching methods to suit their students' language proficiency levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Little, 2006)</ref>.</p><p>Oral communication is a crucial element of ΚΕΠΑ. The CEFR levels provide a comprehensive description of oral production and comprehension skills, and they make it clear that learners must be able to interact effectively in a variety of language contexts (Council of Europe, 2022). Students will improve their skills in an interactive and personalized learning environment by using spoken conversation tools with the help of artificial intelligence.</p><p>The European Common Framework of Reference for Languages provides clear, definitive guidelines and standards for evaluating and developing language skills. The implementation of the ΚΕΠΑ must be made more effective by incorporating artificial intelligence and voice communication into the educational process, which will enhance learners' oral skills.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4.1.">ChatGPT case study</head><p>Particular interest presents the case of spoken conversation in the ai open application of ChatGPT. With the right instructions from the foreign language teacher, this service can be exploited. The student can give instructions in the application and participate in simulated conversations by practicing vocabulary, trying to pronounce correctly and also to understand the respective interlocutor (artificial intelligence). Then, as the conversation history is saved, the student can keep the transcript and work on it with the teacher or on his/her own, improving his/her skills. Also, he can discuss in any language, ask questions, translate. Here is an example of such a use. Figure 3: Example of use 3 Figure 4: Example of use 4 Figure 5: Example of use 5 5.4.2. Case Study: Using the Duolingo Application to Improve Speech</p><p>The second case study examines the use of the Duolingo application, which incorporates artificial intelligence technologies for language learning. Research by <ref type="bibr">Vesselinov and Grego (2012)</ref> showed that users of the app showed significant improvement in their language skills, particularly in pronunciation and listening comprehension, within a few months of using the app.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4.3.">Case Study: applying Rosetta Stone and developing oral skills</head><p>The third case study examines the Rosetta Stone app, which uses AI technologies to facilitate language learning. Students using the app showed undeniable improvements in oral production and comprehension, particularly when used alongside traditional teaching methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Nst, Daulay &amp; Dewi, 2023)</ref>.</p></div>

The results were definitive: students who used AI technologies, such as Duolingo and Rosetta Stone, demonstrated substantial gains in accuracy and fluency compared to those who adhered solely to traditional teaching methods.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Spoken conversation vs Traditional Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.">Advantages and Disadvantages of AI</head><p>Artificial intelligence has transformed French language teaching. There is no doubt that it offers advantages over traditional methods, although there are also disadvantages. In this section, we will present a clear and objective analysis of the main points of comparison, supported by real-world reports and studies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.">Benefits of Artificial Intelligence</head><p>Personalized learning is the future. AI provides personalized lessons and tailored feedback, without a doubt ensuring each student receives the support they need to succeed. This technology allows for continuous assessment and real-time adaptation of learning content <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Holmes, Bialik, &amp; Fadel, 2019)</ref>.</p><p>Students receive immediate feedback on their pronunciation, intonation, and language accuracy through spoken conversation, allowing them to correct errors immediately <ref type="bibr">(Chen et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>The best way to learn is through interaction. AI allows students to create interactive learning environments that encourage active participation and real-time practice with virtual peers <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Marco-Fondevila et al., 2022)</ref>.</p><p>Accessibility is guaranteed. AI platforms are accessible anytime and from anywhere, facilitating continuous practice and repetition <ref type="bibr">(Johnson et al., 2019)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3.">Disadvantages of AI</head><p>The lack of human contact is a problem. Despite advances in technology, it is an irrefutable fact that interaction with a machine cannot fully replace human contact and the authenticity of communication with a teacher or classmate <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Beerends &amp; Aydin, 2024)</ref>. Technical problems will inevitably arise. Reliance on technology can and will lead to problems due to technical errors or incompatibilities that will interrupt or hinder the learning process <ref type="bibr">(Smith &amp; Anderson, 2017)</ref>. Coping with complexity is essential. AI will undoubtedly face challenges in managing the complexities and nuances of human language, especially at advanced levels or in specific communication situations <ref type="bibr">(Li et al., 2022)</ref>. These are two more significant barriers to AI adoption. The cost of installing and maintaining AI systems is a significant barrier to access for all educational institutions <ref type="bibr">(Brown &amp; Adler, 2021)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.4.">Effectiveness and Efficiency</head><p>The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and voice conversation in French language teaching is an effective and efficient method, as evidenced by multiple studies. The following reports definitively show the benefits of using AI in language education.</p><p>Pronunciation improvement is possible. L. ( <ref type="formula">2019</ref>) states that the use of AI in pronunciation training will significantly improve the accuracy and clarity of students' pronunciation. Real-time vocal feedback allows students to immediately correct their mistakes, increasing the effectiveness of learning. Vocabulary and language structures are enhanced. Spoken conversation is an effective tool for developing a richer vocabulary and more complex language structures <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Beck, McKeown &amp; Kucan, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Poveda, 2012)</ref>. Students using AI platforms for language learning demonstrably improve their oral comprehension, as reported by <ref type="bibr">Li et al. (2018)</ref>. Spoken conversation provides exposure to different phonetic patterns, which enhances reception skills. Immediate feedback is key to helping students understand their errors and correct them in real time <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Narciss, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">Shute, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Hattie &amp; Timperley, 2007)</ref>. AI reduces the time required to learn new language skills. Learners who use spoken conversation for language learning complete learning programs more quickly compared to traditional methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Sun, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Zou, Reinders et al. 2023)</ref>. AI tailors learning activities to the needs of each learner, allowing for a more personalised approach and increasing the efficiency of the learning process <ref type="bibr">(Huang et al., 2020)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Study Conclusions</head><p>Artificial intelligence (AI) and spoken conversation are far superior to traditional teaching methods for learning the French language. Comparative studies have irrefutably shown that learners who use artificial intelligence speak their language with greater rhythm, pronunciation, and accuracy.</p><p>A number of studies have demonstrated that students who learn languages through artificial intelligence platforms perform better in oral speech production than those who learn languages using traditional methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Shi, J., Sitthiworachart &amp; Hong, 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Chang, Park, &amp; Suh, 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr">Belda-Medina &amp; Calvo-Ferrer, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wang &amp; Han, 2022)</ref>. The same students also showed clear signs of increased motivation and confidence during lessons. Furthermore, AI provides students with more accurate and faster feedback than human feedback. It identifies and corrects errors immediately, thus improving oral reception and oral production (AbuEl-Reesh &amp; Abu-Naser, 2018). Spoken conversations are the best way to learn French, where oral variations can be challenging. They improve oral reception skills by exposing students to different phonetic patterns and dialects (Byrd, <ref type="bibr">Huang &amp; Edwards, 2022)</ref>.</p><p>Artificial intelligence provides students with the best learning opportunities. They are interactive and flexible, and can be tailored to each student's individual needs and pace. This is a clear advantage over traditional learning methods (El-Sabagh, 2021). The best way to improve students' oral skills and make the French language instruction process more attractive and effective is to integrate artificial intelligence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.">Discussion</head><p>This study proves that artificial intelligence, particularly spoken conversation, markedly enhances oral language production and reception in French language classrooms. Students taught using spoken conversation tools demonstrably outperform those taught using traditional methods in terms of pronunciation, rhythm, and accuracy <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Saran, Seferoglu &amp; Cagıltay, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Lord, 2008)</ref>. It is evident from numerous studies that exposure to diverse phonetic patterns through artificial intelligence significantly enhances oral reception skills and oral production skills <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Ji, Han &amp; Ko, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Goh &amp; Vandergrift, 2021</ref><ref type="bibr">, Ifenthaler, Mah &amp; Yau, 2019)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9.">Conclusions</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9.1.">Main Findings</head><p>This study proves that AI is an invaluable tool for learning French, particularly through spoken conversation.</p><p>Spoken conversation improve pronunciation and rhythm. This is because students receive immediate feedback and corrections <ref type="bibr">(Xu et al., 2019)</ref>. Furthermore, familiarising students with linguistic and phonetic patterns undoubtedly enhances their oral reception skills <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Li &amp; Hegelheimer, 2013)</ref>. A number of studies have demonstrated that students make significant progress when using AI tools, which allow them to advance according to their individual needs and strengths <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Hwang &amp; Tu, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr">Chen, Chen &amp; Lin, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Holmes, Bialik &amp; Fadel, 2019)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9.2.">Contribution of Artificial Intelligence in Language Education</head><p>Artificial intelligence will undoubtedly facilitate a number of innovative ways to learn languages. Spoken conversations are an effective way to learn. This approach allows students to practice their language in a direct, interactive manner without the need for constant teacher attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Nunan, 2015)</ref>. This results in learners remaining engaged for longer <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Chun et al., 2016)</ref>. To improve understanding and communication, you must practice oral language and reception constantly <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Derwing &amp; Munro, 2015)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9.3.">Final Thoughts and Proposals</head><p>French language learning is most effective when combined with artificial intelligence and spoken conversation. New studies must be conducted in order to examine the long-term effects in greater detail and improve existing technologies. Moreover, further research should be conducted for analysing the impact of artificial intelligence on other language skills, such as reading and writing, in order to confirm the findings in various age range and educational environments. The development and evaluation of new technologies for oral communication are being carried out in order to integrate them into existing platforms. As part of the CEFR specifications, it does not include the development of spoken language production applications, which will complement stand-alone foreign language learning programs. The possibility of automated recording of the conversation that will be achieved is another strong stone that also comes to contribute to foreign language learning and teaching. Finally, it has the potential to redefine language education, offering tools that improve language learning and comprehension in ways that were unimaginable until recently.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :Figure 3 :Figure 5 :</head><label>135</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Example of use 1 Figure 2: Example of use 2</figDesc><graphic coords="9,292.60,402.27,204.38,328.70" type="bitmap" /></figure>
