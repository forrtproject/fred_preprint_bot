<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Objectives: This study explored whether job stress, specifically the extrinsic and intrinsic components of the Effort Reward Imbalance (ERI) model, moderates the relationship between obesity and oxidative stress among female nurses. Methods: We conducted an exploratory analysis from a cross-sectional study involving female nurses at a tertiary hospital. The study assessed the prevalence of obesity and overweight, examined correlations among obesity markers and oxidative stress markers, and explored if there is a moderator role of job stress on the relationship between obesity and oxidative stress. Results: The combined prevalence of overweight and obesity in the study population was 74%. Significant positive correlations were found between age, obesity-related parameters (BMI, PBF, WHR), and oxidative stress markers (Protein carbonyl content -PCC and Glutathione S-Transferase -GST). Higher levels of PCC and lower levels of GST were associated with higher BMI, PBF, and WHR. The relationship between obesity and oxidative stress markers was moderated by overcommitment. Nurses with high overcommitment exhibited stronger associations between age, obesity, and oxidative stress markers compared to those with low overcommitment. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that intrinsic job stress, particularly overcommitment, moderates the relationship between obesity and oxidative stress. This indicates that job stress should be considered in interventions targeting obesity among nurses. Further studies with larger samples are needed to confirm these findings and develop effective interventions addressing job stress and overcommitment.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Obesity among nurses is a global concern threatening healthcare systems. A meta-analysis from 29 countries reported a 47% prevalence of combined overweight and obesity in nurses, higher than in the general population and other healthcare personnel <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">2)</ref>. Earlier studies in the Indian scenario reported 40-80% prevalence of combined overweight and obesity among nurses <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(3,</ref><ref type="bibr">4)</ref>. This obesity rate poses significant health risks, including cardiovascular, metabolic, reproductive, and mental health issues <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(5)</ref><ref type="bibr">(6)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(7)</ref><ref type="bibr">(8)</ref>. A recent Lancet report identifies obesity as a key contributor to young-onset diabetes, with a study highlighting high central obesity prevalence and co-morbid pre-diabetes and diabetes in female nurses <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">9)</ref>. High work stress and shift work further exacerbate obesity risks and its consequences (10). Additionally, obesity among healthcare employees is linked to lower productivity and higher healthcare utilization, increasing the economic burden on organizations <ref type="bibr">(11,</ref><ref type="bibr">12)</ref>. Given this high prevalence, understanding how obesity adversely affects nurses' physical and mental health in the context of job stress is crucial.</p><p>A significant body of research highlights the relationship between oxidative stress, obesity, and its associated health consequences. Oxidative stress is an imbalance between reactive oxygen species production and antioxidant defense in the body leading to tissue and cellular damage <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(13)</ref>. Protein carbonylation, an irreversible marker of oxidative stress is linked to adiposity, serum free fatty acids, and insulin resistance (14,15). The American Heart Association states that oxidative stress, coupled with inflammation and drives atherosclerosis in obese young adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(5)</ref>. This is particularly relevant for nurses, where obesity is prevalent, and job stress is also a known factor to aggravate oxidative stress.</p><p>Oxidative stress, a critical factor in work-related stress, is linked to burnout and shift work, particularly affecting females. Healthcare workers with prolonged work hours exhibit increased oxidative stress due to high workload and psychological stress (16). Among healthcare workers, including nurses, lipid peroxidation biomarkers correlate with burnout, and evening and night shifts further increase oxidative stress markers (17). In the Indian population, shift work heightens oxidative stress and metabolic risks, reducing antioxidant capacities (18). This trend extends to the general working population, with the effort-reward imbalance (ERI) model highlighting high overcommitment and elevated malondialdehyde levels in nurses (19). <ref type="bibr">Bardhan et al. found</ref> elevated malondialdehyde levels in nurses with high overcommitment, reflecting the ERI model's intrinsic and extrinsic components <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(20)</ref>. Females with high psychological stress and perceived workload show increased oxidative stress markers but not in males <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">22)</ref>.</p><p>Studies on stress and obesity show mixed results. Some research suggests a significant correlation <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(23)</ref>, possibly due to unhealthy eating habits linked to job stress and shift work <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(24)</ref>.</p><p>Conversely, other studies find no significant relationship, suggesting that job stress might not need consideration when addressing obesity <ref type="bibr">(25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">26)</ref>. Reflecting on these conflicting findings and the high prevalence of obesity in our study population, we conducted an exploratory analysis with an all-female nursing sample. We explored if job stress (both extrinsic and intrinsic components of Effort Reward Imbalance) moderates the relation between obesity and oxidative stress. The premise for this exploration was based on the findings that effort-reward imbalance moderated the relationship between overcommitment and inflammation <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(27)</ref>, and that job stress was associated with health risks only in obese women <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(28)</ref>. Although the relationship between obesity and work stress may not be direct, job stress could moderate the biological effects of obesity. Our analysis suggests that job stress, particularly overcommitment-a key component of effort-reward imbalance-may moderate the link between obesity and oxidative stress. This provides a strong basis for further testing this hypothesis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Materials and Methods</head><p>This study conducted an exploratory analysis of primary data that investigated associations between job stress, sleep quality, and inflammatory markers. The data was derived from a crosssectional design involving female nurses who volunteered for the study working at a government tertiary hospital in western India. Inclusion criteria included nurses who are involved in clinical work for at least six months. We excluded anyone with a history of untreated medical and psychiatric disorders. The primary study was approved by the Institutional Ethical Committee. The study was conducted in September-November 2022 at the participants' workplace. Demographic details, including age and smoking and alcohol habits (with no history of smoking or alcohol consumption), as well as work factors such as hours of work, night duties, place of work, and years of work, were collected. Night duties were minimal as the original study excluded participants with frequent night duties in the preceding months.</p><p>For this study, the following obesity-related parameters were the main outcome. Body mass index (BMI), Percentage Body Fat (PBF), and Waist-Hip Ratio (WHR) were collected using body impedance analysis (InBody 270 analyzer, Cerritos, CA, USA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(29)</ref>, with BMI classified according to Misra et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(30)</ref> and PBF and WHR classified according to WHO standards. The predictors included job stress by the effort-reward imbalance model (31) and was assessed using effortreward imbalance (ERI) and overcommitment scales. Overcommitment phenotype is characterized by difficulty detaching from work and constant rumination about work. Effort scores ranged from 6-24, reward scores 10-40 and overcommitment ranged from 6-24. Effort reward ratio was calculated by the formula E/R*c where c is the correction factor for number of questions in effort and reward subscales (6/10 here). A higher effort reward ratio meant high job stress. We treated effort-reward imbalance as a continuous score and grouped them into two based on median splits. For overcommitment, we converted the raw scores (range 6-24) to scores ranging from 0-100 by the following formula: OC percentage scores = ((oc_total-6)/18)*100); with 6 being the minimal scores in overcommitment questionnaire and 18 being the difference between maximum (24) and minimum (6) scores. After this we grouped them into two based on lesser than 50% as low and &gt;= 50 being high overcommitment. Physical activity was assessed by asking if they indulged in any physical activity consistently. If affirmative, type of activity, their duration and frequency in a week were recorded.</p><p>Oxidative stress markers, including Protein Carbonyl Content (PCC), Glutathione S-Transferase (GST), Glutathione (GSH), Lipid Peroxidation (LPO), Protein total (PTN), and Superoxide Dismutase (SOD), were measured using ELISA. Using a Synergy H1MD, BioTek, USA, multimode analyzer, all the biochemical parameters were assessed in the serum samples separated from 5ml whole blood collected from participants. Oxidative stress markers were evaluated as per the earlier described protocols <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(32)</ref>. All the samples were run in duplicates.</p><p>Several measures were taken to address potential sources of bias: Participants were all female nurses working at the same tertiary hospital, minimizing variability due to different work environments. Data on job stress, and obesity markers, were collected using validated instruments and standardized procedures to ensure consistency. Transcription of data to analysis sheet was verified individually by two personnel for quality checks. Participants with frequent night duties in the preceding months were excluded to control for the confounding effect of irregular work hours on sleep quality and stress levels. We made sincere efforts to ensure high participation rates by conducting the study at convenient times and providing detailed explanations of the study's importance to potential participants.</p><p>This study is a pilot investigation, and a sample size of 50 female nurses was chosen. The sample size was determined based on practical considerations, including the availability of participants and resources. This preliminary sample allows for an initial exploration of the relationships between job stress, obesity, and oxidative stress, providing valuable insights for subsequent larger studies. For detailed information on the number of individuals at each stage of the study, reasons for non-participation, and participant flow, please refer to our original study <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(27)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical Analysis</head><p>We employed a multi-step statistical analysis approach. We first assessed the prevalence of obesity and overweight among the participants, then examined the correlations among obesity markers (BMI, PBF, WHR) and oxidative stress markers using Pearson correlation coefficients.</p><p>Finally, for the oxidative markers significantly associated with obesity-related variables, we conducted a series of correlations grouped by median splits of job stress scores (extrinsic: ER ratio, intrinsic: overcommitment). To control for physical activity, we ran linear regressions with each predictor and physical activity in the model separately for high and low overcommitment groups.</p><p>Statistical tests were considered significant if p values were &lt; 0.05.</p><p>The exploratory analysis plans were pre-registered in OSF at https://osf.io/c8dtp/. The analysis was conducted using R version 4.1.1 (2021-08-10) <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(33)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>The overall aim of the study was to explore the moderation effects of job stress-both extrinsic and intrinsic components-on the relationships between obesity and oxidative stress. Data were cross-sectionally collected from 50 female nurses working at a tertiary hospital. There were 50 participants (100% female) with a mean age of 31.6 years (SD = 7.2, range: 21-47), a mean education of 15.0 years (SD = 0.5, range: 12-17), and a mean working experience as a nurse of 45.66 months (SD = 4.9, range: 36-72). Data was available for all 50 participants, except for PBF and WHR, for which 3 participants were missing data. The participants' descriptive table is presented in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>High prevalence of obesity and overweight in the study population</head><p>There was a high prevalence of obesity and overweight in the study population with a combined prevalence of 74% (overweight = 14%, obesity = 60%). This was based on the BMI classification of &gt; 24.99 as obese and &gt; 22.99 as overweight for Asian females <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(30)</ref>.</p><p>When considering percentage body fat (PBF), the combined prevalence was 86% (overweight:</p><p>8% [PBF of 30-35%], Obese: 78% [PBF &gt;35%]).</p><p>The prevalence of central obesity was 76% based on the WHR classification of ≥ 0.85 for Asian females. Notably, 62% of the study population were not physically active.</p><p>Supplementary Table - </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Obesity associated with increased oxidative stress markers</head><p>To investigate if obesity-related markers -BMI, PBF, WHR were associated with oxidative stress markers, we ran a panel of correlations Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>. There is a significant correlation between age, obesity-related parameters (BMI, PBF, WHR) and oxidative stress markers specifically protein carbonyl content (PCC) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST). Higher levels of PCC and lower levels of GST were associated with higher BMI, PBF and WHR. This suggests there is an association among obesity-related variables and 2 of the tested oxidative stress markers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Overcommitment moderated association between obesity and oxidative stress markers</head><p>To explore if occupational stress moderates the relationships between obesity-related markers and oxidative stress markers, we ran a series of scatterplots faceted by the overcommitment group (split at 50%) and the effort-reward imbalance (ERI) ratio (split at the median).</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> (for PCC marker) and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref> (for GST marker) indicate the moderating effect of overcommitment on the association between age, obesity, and oxidative stress markers. In the presence of high overcommitment among nurses, the relationship between age, obesity, and oxidative stress markers is stronger compared to nurses with low overcommitment. These findings suggest that overcommitment is a moderator for obesity-and age-associated oxidative stress changes, observed only in those with high overcommitment.</p><p>Regressions controlling for physical activity among all the previously described predictors with PCC and GST are provided in Supplementary Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>. The results remained consistent even after controlling physical activity in the models.</p><p>Additionally, the detailed percentages of responses to all six overcommitment questionnaire items are depicted in Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>. Although the majority disagreed with feeling overwhelmed due to time pressures at work, most participants strongly agreed when asked if they think about work first thing in the morning and if it rarely leaves their mind at bedtime. Many participants also reported trouble staying asleep at night if they had postponed something at work.</p><p>The majority disagreed with the statement about easily switching off from work after reaching home. All these points indicate a high overcommitment phenotype characterized by an inability to detach from work.</p><p>Supplementary Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref> depict the moderative effects of the effort-reward ratio on the relationships between obesity and oxidative stress markers. No significantly different relationships were observed between the effort-reward ratio groups (high and low) in the association between obesity and oxidative stress on PCC. Similar to overcommitment, there is a pattern but only with GST (not for WHR). This suggests that ERI may act as a moderator in obesity-associated oxidative stress, but only for GST and not for PCC.</p><p>Ranges of all the six tested oxidative stress markers is depicted in Supplementary table <ref type="table">3</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Given that oxidative stress is a potential mechanism for adverse health consequences related to both obesity and job stress, we explored whether job stress (extrinsic ERI and intrinsic overcommitment) moderates the relationship between obesity and oxidative stress markers. In an all-female nursing population with a high prevalence of obesity, we found that overcommitment moderated the relationship between obesity and oxidative stress. Specifically, in those with high overcommitment, the relationship between obesity (measured by WHR, PBF, and BMI) was significantly associated with increased oxidative stress and decreased antioxidant capacities, determined by two markers: PCC and GST. Similar findings of moderation were also observed with age and oxidative stress. Protein carbonyl is associated with diabetes and increased mortality in the literature, suggesting that overcommitment may exacerbate obesity-associated metabolic syndrome, particularly through the PCC marker <ref type="bibr">(34,</ref><ref type="bibr">35</ref>). An earlier study noted that overcommitment, rather than effortreward imbalance (ERI), showed biological consequences related to job stress (36). Our data support this understanding and highlight the necessity of shifting the focus from extrinsic to intrinsic stressors when studying oxidative stress and work stress. Additionally, one earlier study noted that overcommitment was associated with mental health issues, whereas ERI was not (37).</p><p>This finding further supports our results, emphasizing the significant role of intrinsic stressors, such as overcommitment, in affecting mental health.</p><p>The study's clean sample is a notable strength, as our participants were exclusively non-smoking, non-drinking females. Despite the small sample size, the magnitude and consistency of the results underscore the importance of these findings from the exploratory analysis. The bidirectional relationship between obesity and oxidative stress, along with the study's cross-sectional nature, does not diminish the implications. The findings of this study may have limited generalizability due to the specific population of female nurses in a single tertiary hospital in Western India. However, the consistent relationships observed between job stress, obesity, and oxidative stress suggest that similar mechanisms may be present in other populations with high job stress and obesity rates. Future research should test these findings in larger, more diverse samples to confirm the generalizability of these results and to explore the potential impact of cultural and occupational differences. This is crucial for those focusing on obesity, as work stress plays a significant role, and for those in occupational health, considering that obesity may amplify the consequences related to work stress. Interventions targeting overcommitment should test for the weakening of these associations, thus positioning overcommitment as a target for reducing obesity-associated consequences in the nursing population.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>Our exploratory study presents a strong hypothesis for further testing with larger samples of nursing populations, suggesting that job stress, particularly intrinsic overcommitment, moderates the links between obesity and oxidative stress. Intervention studies focusing on obesity should consider job stress as a potential moderator, and more interventions targeting overcommitment in occupational settings should be implemented.    </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Overcommitment to work-marked by a strong attachment to work and difficulty detachingsignificantly contributes to perceived stress and its psychological effects. Elevated oxidative stress with PCC and reduced GST, an antioxidant marker, indicate a link between overcommitment and stress-related biomarkers. Our findings suggest that individuals who struggle to relax after work may benefit from targeted interventions to reduce their associated health risks. Participants often report lacking time for physical activity, emphasizing the need for workplace interventions during work hours. Even after adjusting for physical activity, the significant impact of stress underscores the necessity for occupational stress interventions beyond the typical focus on physical activity. Additionally, addressing the knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) gap among nurses could be valuable, given the high prevalence of obesity in this group.</figDesc></figure>
