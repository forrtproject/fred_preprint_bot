<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>To what extent do people prioritize living in a democracy over other indicators of good governance or personal well-being? This question has become contested as democracies come under pressure worldwide. We address this gap through crossnational conjoint experiments in which survey respondents choose between hypothetical countries that differ in terms of societal-level attributes (e.g., elections, health care) and individual-level outcomes that the respondent would experience (e.g., wealth, minority status). People across Egypt, India, Italy, Japan, Thailand, and the United States consistently prioritize living in a safe country with free and fair elections over other factors, including other components of democracy like civil liberties and checks and balances. Regarding tradeoffs, many people would forfeit democratic elections to avoid living in a dangerous society but not to obtain wealth and other goods. Electoral democracy is attractive globally but can be undermined by concerns about crime and safety.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Most people worldwide express support for democratic governance and say they would like to live in a democratic country <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Norris, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Voeten, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b108">Wuttke et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b110">Zhai, 2022)</ref>. At the same time, democracy is under pressure worldwide. Since the beginning of the 21st century, the global spread of democracy has slowed and potentially even reversed. The quality of democracy has also deteriorated sharply in some fully-fledged democracies like the United States, while authoritarian rule has hardened in countries like Russia <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Levitsky &amp; Ziblatt, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Varshney, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Wiebrecht et al., 2023)</ref>. Furthermore, political leaders responsible for triggering democratic backsliding or autocratization sometimes retain substantial mass approval <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">(Svolik, 2020)</ref>, avoiding the type of public opposition that would safeguard democracy <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Braley et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr">Laebens &amp; Öztürk, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Norris, 2011)</ref>.</p><p>In international relations, China's increasing assertiveness has placed front and center debates about democracy's normative value and ability to serve the people <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Diamond, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Goldsmith et al., 2025;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">von Soest, 2015)</ref>. China and other autocratic governments promote their model of governance in part by claiming-often contrary to evidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Gerring et al., 2022)</ref>-that the democratic alternative comes with a variety of undesirable tradeoffs to economic growth, public welfare, and safety <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Mattingly et al., 2024)</ref>. If people accept these arguments, they may be more amenable to autocratic influence in the international system <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Chu 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Han et al., 2025)</ref>. This tension between people expressing support for democracy on the one hand, and the global erosion of democracy coupled with the proliferation of antidemocratic behavior and viewpoints on the other, makes it critical to better understand the contexts in which people are committed to democracy. One explanation consistent with this disconnect is that people genuinely view democracy as desirable in principle, while also placing more importance on other political, economic, and social factors in practice. Scholars argue, for instance, that people are sometimes willing to forgo democracy if they perceive it as an obstacle to obtaining economic growth and prosperity (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Ceka &amp; Magalhães, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr">Cordero &amp; Simon, 2016)</ref>, reducing corruption and insecurity (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Abadeer et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Cammett et al., 2020)</ref>, or elevating the political and social power of their partisan, ethnic, or religious group (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Carey et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr">Graham &amp; Svolik, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Svolik, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">cf. Voelkel et al., 2023)</ref>. This body of research explores the contexts in which support for democracy may weaken. However, it has not adequately addressed four key questions about the extent to which people are willing to prioritize such outcomes over democracy. 1   First, how these various factors concurrently contribute to democratic support relative to one another remains unclear yet critical to understand. Countries often struggle simultaneously with economic, social, and political problems, so identifying which of these challenges most strongly impacts mass opinion would provide new guidance for what to prioritize in sustaining the public's democratic commitments.</p><p>Second, it is also unclear whether sociotropic or personal circumstances weigh more heavily on people's willingness to abandon democracy. People driven by sociotropic concerns may trade away democracy because they are dissatisfied with national outcomes, such as the country's overall economy or ability to combat corruption. Alternatively, people may care about these factors only insofar as they are personally impacted through their pocketbooks and livelihood.</p><p>Third, few existing studies examine whether people weigh outcomes against democracy similarly across national contexts, especially beyond the United States and Western countries. Without this knowledge that is central to comparative politics, scholars cannot easily generalize about their insights and determine if different countries, whether they are developing countries or those closer to China's sphere of influence, think about the value of democracy versus other factors differently.</p><p>Lastly, most previous research does not decompose "democratic governance" into its several constituent parts when assessing which aspects of democracy are most susceptible to neglect. For example, people may be more willing to concede civil liberties but not elections for security. New knowledge on this point can help to identify which particular aspects of democracy are relatively resilient or prone to erosion.</p><p>1. Throughout the paper, we refer to this prioritization of outcomes versus democracy as a willingness to "trade off" or "trade away" democracy. By using this language, we do not mean to assume that an individual is already living in a democracy, but we are instead emphasizing the lower weight they attach to democracy relative to political, economic, and social outcomes.</p><p>A handful of recent studies have addressed some of these points, but none have addressed all four in combination. 2 Our study is designed to account for all four, enabling us to uncover timely insights regarding mass democratic commitments. Specifically, we implemented a unified conjoint experiment in six, diverse countries to study which aspects of democracy people value most relative to political, economic, and social outcomes, as well as the extent to which these outcomes are likely to induce people to trade away key elements of democratic governance. Respondents in our surveys were shown pairs of hypothetical country profiles characterized by ten different attributes (three regarding democracy and seven regarding other factors such as national wealth, health care, and public safety) and asked to choose which country they would prefer to live in. We chose this pairedconjoint design because it is useful for evaluating how people make multidimensional choices, providing an appropriate design for assessing how much emphasis people place on democracy relative to both sociotropic and individual outcomes. The study's implementation in a diverse range of six countries-Egypt, India, Italy, Japan, South Korea, and the United States-also allows us to better understand any potential variation in people's democratic preferences across different societies.</p><p>Our cross-national experiments reveal that people consistently value free and fair elections even when confronting tradeoffs. In most cases, respondents preferred living in a country with free and fair elections but with less desirable outcomes (e.g., low levels of individual and national wealth, inaccessible health care, prevalent corruption) to living in a country without free and fair elections but with better outcomes.</p><p>The only exception is public safety, such that respondents generally prioritized a "very safe" country without democratic elections over a "very dangerous" country with democratic elections.</p><p>This finding provides a novel microfoundational explanation for why contemporary authoritarian 2. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Adserà et al. (2023)</ref> focus on free and fair elections rather than the other components of democracy, and their study is implemented in three countries, two of which are Western democracies; <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Neundorf et al. (2024)</ref> do not incorporate individual-level circumstances into their design; and <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Ferrer et al. (2025)</ref> address attitudes in Europe and Israel while including fewer outcomes against which citizens may trade off democracy.</p><p>superpowers-in their global contest for legitimacy-often try to portray foreign democracies as chaotic and unsafe in their domestic and international propaganda (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Chester, 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Chester &amp; Wong, 2025)</ref>. By associating democracies with danger and authoritarian governance with stability, such political communication could reinforce people's beliefs about the superiority of the authoritarian model <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Mattingly et al., 2024)</ref> and help diminish demands for democratic reform <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Deng, 2025)</ref>.</p><p>We also find that people generally value civil liberties and institutional checks, but their commitment to these two components of democracy is less robust and is susceptible to tradeoffs not only against public safety but also against other socioeconomic goods. This finding speaks to recent episodes of democratic backsliding, where populists have transgressed democracy by incrementally eroding civil liberties and institutional checks and balances, while promising superior delivery of social goods to the mass public and refraining from severely undermining electoral institutions in their country.</p><p>Surprisingly, we uncover little heterogeneity in how people make democratic tradeoffs across and within six very different countries. There are some statistically significant differences, for example, across regime type, region, and individual-characteristics like college education, but none of these differences are large enough to alter our substantive conclusions about the relative importance of free and fair elections and public safety. Such consistency across and within countries speaks to the convergence of mass values globally, pushing back against arguments about cultural relativism, such as the Asian values thesis (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Dalton &amp; Ong, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">Welzel, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b110">Zhai, 2022)</ref>. The general homogeneity in preferences across socioeconomic factors also contrasts with modernization and postmaterialism theories, which posit that people's desire for democracy primarily forms at certain levels of wealth and education. Furthermore, we corroborate our experimental findings regarding the vulnerability of democracy to public security concerns using observational survey data from the Asian Barometer Survey (Wave 6), which includes eight additional countries.</p><p>Our study thus extends recent empirical evidence regarding the global appeal of democracy among ordinary citizens, especially in the domain of free elections <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Adserà et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Ferrer et al., 2025;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Neundorf et al., 2024)</ref>. We also advance scholarship on public support for democracy. Recent work finds that people understand democracy predominantly in electoral and liberal democratic terms <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Chu et al., 2024)</ref> and that "democratic support <ref type="bibr">[...]</ref> is mostly immune to crises of performance" <ref type="bibr">(Claassen &amp; Magalhães, 2022, p. 869</ref>). Yet, whether and to what extent ordinary people prioritize democracy when it conflicts with other desirable social outcomes remains unclear in the existing literature. Using a research design appropriate for evaluating how individuals make tradeoffs in their decision-making (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Abou-Chadi et al., 2025;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Häusermann et al., 2019)</ref>, we</p><p>show that individuals from six countries consistently prioritize living in a safe country with free and fair elections over other factors, including other components of democracy like civil liberties and checks and balances. Many people would forfeit democratic elections to avoid living in a dangerous society but not to obtain wealth and other goods. Electoral democracy is attractive globally but can be undermined by concerns about crime and safety.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Importance of Democracy versus Societal and Personal Outcomes</head><p>Across the world, people predominantly express support for democracy <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">(Wike et al., 2017)</ref>, and this has been true for some time <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Norris, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr">O'Donnell, 2007)</ref>. Though support may fluctuate thermostatically within countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Claassen, 2020)</ref>, and though people in some countries may</p><p>have become more open to nondemocratic alternatives in recent years <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">(Wike &amp; Fetterolf, 2018)</ref>, democracy is a robust global norm of good governance. Most people in most countries consistently claim that democracy is the best form of government and that they want to be governed democratically, even if they are dissatisfied with how their own democratic governments are performing <ref type="bibr">(Democracy Perception Index, 2024)</ref>. A number of studies from countries worldwide find evidence that people dislike undemocratic behaviors and will approve less of political leaders who engage in them (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Chu &amp; Williamson, 2025;</ref><ref type="bibr">Frederiksen, 2024a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Frederiksen &amp; Skaaning, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Holliday et al., 2024)</ref>.</p><p>Despite this popular support, democracy has experienced a global decline over the past decade.</p><p>The extent of this decline continues to be debated <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Little &amp; Meng, 2024)</ref>. At best, however, the number of democracies worldwide has stagnated, several leading democracies-including India and the United States-have experienced democratic backsliding, and powerful authoritarian regimes have become both more repressive and more aggressive on the world stage <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Herre, 2025;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Lieberman et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Repucci &amp; Slipowitz, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Varshney, 2022)</ref>. In more pessimistic accounts, the number of democracies has fallen and the percentage of people living under a democracy has declined substantially from its peak <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Angiolillo et al., 2024)</ref>.</p><p>A major factor behind this democratic decline may be the role of anti-democratic political elites, who seek to increase personal or partisan power at the expense of democratic norms and governance <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Carothers &amp; Hartnett, 2024)</ref>. Nonetheless, how the public views democracy is also an important part of the story. Popular backlash to anti-democratic politicians can constrain efforts by elites to undermine democracy <ref type="bibr">(Claassen, 2020a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Weingast, 1997)</ref>. Alternatively, elites may be more likely to engage in backsliding if they can count on their coalition of voters to support them <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">(Stokes, 2025;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Waldner &amp; Lust, 2018)</ref>. In many cases where backsliding has occurredwhether Hungary, India, Turkey, or the United States-political leaders have acquired and retained substantial popular support, which they have used to justify and sustain their attacks on democratic norms and institutions <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Braley et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Rogenhofer &amp; Panievsky, 2020)</ref>. Yet, at the same time, there is little evidence that expressed support for democracy has declined among the public in these and other countries (Democracy Perception Index, 2024).</p><p>Why might people who support democracy simultaneously support leaders who engage in antidemocratic behaviors? One explanation could be that many of these people do not believe that their political leaders are undermining democracy. Research suggests that free and fair elections and strong protections for civil liberties are understood to be key components of democracy in many countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Chu et al., 2024</ref>). Yet, people may have different ideas about what threatens these aspects of democracy <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Kaftan &amp; Gessler, 2025;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b107">Wunsch et al., 2025)</ref>. Political leaders may be effective at framing anti-democratic actions as consistent with these democratic principles <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">(Titelman et al., 2024)</ref>, and such obfuscation may be worsened by partisan motivated reasoning, as people convince themselves that their co-partisans are actively defending rather than degrading democ-racy <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Braley et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Krishnarajan, 2023)</ref>. Some people also believe that positive governance outcomes make governments more democratic <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Chu et al., 2024)</ref>, which may create space for antidemocratic political leaders to point to good outcomes-such as reducing gender and economic inequality-as proof of their democratic character <ref type="bibr">(Wang &amp; Yeung, 2025)</ref>.</p><p>Another explanation for the disconnect between people's expressed support for democracy and their active support for anti-democratic political leaders could be that these people care about democracy but care even more about other features of their own lives or their societies. In this case, people may be willing to trade democracy away for outcomes that they perceive as more important for themselves or for their country more broadly. Studies from various countries suggest that such tradeoffs exist under certain conditions. For instance, poor economic outcomes can dampen enthusiasm for democracy (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Armingeon &amp; Guthmann, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Ceka &amp; Magalhães, 2022)</ref>, and where crime rates are high, people may also become less committed to democratic governance (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Abadeer et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Claassen &amp; Magalhães, 2022)</ref>. People may also be willing to forgo democracy if they can lock in power for their partisan in-group <ref type="bibr">(Graham &amp; Svolik, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Orhan, 2022)</ref>.</p><p>However, several critical questions remain regarding people's hypothesized willingness to trade away democracy for outcomes. First, it is unclear how these different outcomes shape people's commitment to democracy relative to each other. For example, does economic performance matter more than the quality of public goods or the intensity of crime and violence? Second, less attention has been given to how people weigh their personal situation against the broader circumstances in their country. Third, well-identified studies are typically implemented in one country or a small number of countries, making it more difficult to determine how democratic tradeoffs generalize across cases. Fourth, democracy is often treated as a unitary concept. However, even minimalist definitions of democracy include multiple components-including elections, liberties, and institutional checks-that governments must incorporate to qualify as democracies. Are people more willing to give up on some of these components for better outcomes? Some recent studies have begun to explore these points. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Adserà et al. (2023)</ref> evaluate whether people are willing to trade elections for income or better health care. They estimate that respondents "prefer to live in a country without free democratic elections only if their individual income multiplies by at least three times" <ref type="bibr">(Adserà et al., 2023, p. 1)</ref>. This evidence suggests a strong commitment to democracy over personal income, but it does not speak to other components of democratic governance and explores a relatively limited set of outcomes and cases. <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Neundorf et al. (2024)</ref> implement another important study that incorporates more aspects of democracy in more countries. They likewise find a strong commitment to elections, but less commitment to executive constraints as well as a willingness to trade these democratic components for economic security.</p><p>However, their design does not incorporate individual-level circumstances that may affect how people weigh the relative importance of sociotropic outcomes against democracy, and it also includes a relatively small number of sociotropic outcomes. Finally, <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Ferrer et al. (2025)</ref> compare six elements of democracy against gains in personal income. They likewise find a strong commitment to elections, but weaker commitment to checks and balances. However, their study focuses predominantly on Europe and does not include security or other sociotropic factors that people may weigh against different aspects of democracy. Thus, while this emerging body of research breaks new ground, it leaves questions about mass democratic values unexplored.</p><p>To strengthen understanding of whether and for what people are willing to trade away democratic governance, our study decomposes democracy into three central elements: leadership selection, civil liberties, and institutional checks. We then consider whether people are willing to abandon these democratic components for seven desirable societal and personal outcomes: the state of the national economy, the extent of an individual's wealth, public safety, corruption in politics, public goods, the treatment of minority groups in society, and an individual's status as a majority or minority group member. 3 3. Our discussion of these various factors draws from research seeking to understand macropatterns in democratization, democratic consolidation, and democratic backsliding. While related, the causal factors across these literatures may differ. We do not generate individuallevel hypotheses about which factors will matter more in which macro context and instead take an empirical approach by including countries of different regime backgrounds in our selection of field sites, described below.</p><p>Beginning with the three traditional dimensions of democracy that people might value, we examine leadership selection, civil liberties, and institutional checks and balances. These dimensions map onto the core components associated with dominant conceptualizations of democracy, which define it as a political system in which key political leaders are selected through competitive elections, citizens' core political liberties are protected, and executive power is constrained through a system of checks and balances <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Dahl, 1971;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">König et al., 2022)</ref>.</p><p>Next, we also examine political, economic, and social outcomes that existing research suggests can weaken people's commitment to democracy. A substantial body of research suggests that economic outcomes shape support for the political system, such that poor economic performance may weaken support for democracy <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Albrecht et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Cammett et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr">Cordero &amp; Simon, 2016)</ref>. These effects may operate through perceptions of how well the economy is performing nationally <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Armingeon &amp; Guthmann, 2013)</ref>; alternatively, they may operate through personal circumstances, with worse individual outcomes generating less commitment to democracy <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Ceka &amp; Magalhães, 2020)</ref>. Thus, both the national economy and the individual's wealth could engender substantial tradeoffs against democracy.</p><p>Public safety can also play an important role in shaping tradeoff dynamics. A large body of work indicates that criminal violence and political instability can weaken support for democracy (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Abadeer et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Blanco, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Cammett et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Fernandez &amp; Kuenzi, 2010)</ref> and increase authoritarian preferences (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Bateson, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr">Masullo et al., forthcoming)</ref>. In particular, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Claassen and Magalhães (2022)</ref> leverage time-series, cross-sectional data from 91 democracies and find that "increases in the national rate of interpersonal violence clearly have negative effects on evaluations of, and attachment to, democracy" (p. 885). If people do not feel safe, even those who support democratic governance in theory may be willing to tolerate nondemocratic alternatives in practice.</p><p>We additionally consider two salient dimensions over which people may feel their societies are unfair, a sentiment that has been shown to impact support for political systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Levi et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Rothstein, 2009)</ref>. For one, people care strongly that political leaders and others with connections do not receive corrupt benefits from the system <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Anderson &amp; Tverdova, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Linde &amp; Erlingsson, 2013)</ref>. If corruption in politics is prevalent, people may prefer a less democratic system with a cleaner government. Next, people also value public goods that are accessible to all, regardless of one's status <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Helliwell &amp; Huang, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Rothstein &amp; Teorell, 2008)</ref>. If access to public goods is unequal, it may generate a sense of unfairness that reduces government legitimacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Levi et al., 2009)</ref>, creating a condition conducive to people trading away democracy.</p><p>Lastly, we consider minority treatment and the individual's minority status along ethnic, racial, or religious lines. Intergroup relations are salient in most societies <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">(Silver et al., 2021)</ref>, and research</p><p>shows that perceptions of legitimacy are affected by whether minorities are also treated justly <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">(Tyler &amp; Wakslak, 2004)</ref>. Thus, people may prioritize fair treatment of minorities over democratic governance. At the same time, democratic commitments may depend on one's own position in society <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">(Wilkes &amp; Wu, 2018)</ref>, such that people may want to live in a country where they are personally part of the dominant group and thus have more social and political power.</p><p>We design a conjoint experiment to test whether, where, and for whom these various social and personal outcomes induce a willingness to trade away different components of democratic governance. The next section explains our approach in detail.</p></div>

Replication materials and code can be found at <ref type="bibr">Chu et al.

Because we used quota sampling, we were able to recruit a demographically diverse sample that mirrored national benchmarks in age, gender, and education in each country. In SI Appendix Section L, we demonstrate the diversity of each country sample and of our selected countries in Tables <ref type="table">S3</ref> and <ref type="table">S4</ref>.</p><p>We chose Qualtrics because it allowed us not only to implement the conjoint experimental design with strong researcher control but also to simultaneously field the experiment in multiple countries with pre-specified demographic quotas for each. We do acknowledge, however, that our Internet opt-in samples are not fully nationally representative (albeit diverse). Nevertheless, our experimental findings are likely generalizable to the broader populations of interest because our analysis of heterogeneous treatment effects reveals homogeneity across several individuallevel factors, including age, gender, education, socioeconomic status, minority status, and political predispositions (see SI Appendix Section F). Such homogeneity helps to alleviate concerns about external validity because it suggests that the results will most likely be replicable with an alternative sample that differs in the distribution of these individual characteristics <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Coppock et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">Druckman, 2022, pp. 70-83)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Research procedures</head><p>We embedded our conjoint experiment in each of the six surveys. After respondents reported their social and political backgrounds and passed an attention check, they saw the following introductory vignette for our conjoint task: "Next, we will show you information about two hypothetical countries at a time, and then ask which of the two you would prefer to be born and grow up in. We will give you the information about each country in a table. The table will have several rows of information describing different aspects of the countries. Some of the information may be important to you, while others may not." The table contained the wording of all country attributes, as shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>.</p><p>Each attribute was motivated by the literature (see the previous section). Our first three attributes randomized aspects of a country's democracy or lack thereof. First, we incorporated a leader selection attribute in which free and fair elections were compared against undemocratic means of leader selection, including unfair elections, appointment by unelected elites, hereditary succession, and military coups. Second, we included an attribute for civil liberties, varying whether citizens are free to express themselves and organize, whether they face some risk of repression for doing so, or whether they face severe repression. Third, we included an attribute for institutional checks, randomizing if the leader must usually, sometimes, or rarely respect the authority of the legislature and courts.</p><p>The next seven attributes focused on the outcomes for which people may deprioritize democracy. Attribute four is the national economy, i.e., whether the country is high-income, mediumincome, or low-income. Attribute five is the respondent's personal wealth, i.e., whether the individual respondent would be wealthier than most, about average in their wealth, or poorer than most in the hypothetical country. Attribute six is public safety, i.e., whether the country is very safe, somewhat safe, somewhat dangerous, or very dangerous.</p><p>Attribute seven is corruption in politics, randomizing whether political leaders very rarely, sometimes, or frequently engage in corruption. Attribute eight taps into public goods provision, randomizing whether high quality health care is accessible to most people or only to those with money and connections. Lastly, attributes nine and ten describe people's social concerns about identity groups along ethnic, racial, or religious lines. As with the economic attributes, we distinguish sociotropic and individual-level concerns. Specifically, attribute nine randomized whether minorities in the country are treated fairly, sometimes unfairly, or mostly unfairly, while attribute ten randomized whether the respondent themselves would be part of the largest majority group, second largest group, or smallest minority group. 5 5. One question for conjoint designs is how the researcher(s) choose the range of levels for each attribute. We choose the attribute-levels to optimize theory testing, the realism of the descriptors, and cross-national comparability. Nevertheless, given this paper's headline finding Perceptions that people are treated unfairly can weaken legitimacy of the authorities <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">(Tyler &amp; Wakslak, 2004)</ref> Respondent identity Your ethnicity/race/religion would [put you in the largest majority group / put you in the second largest group / put you in the smallest minority group] Democratic commitments may depend on one's own position in society, especially along the lines of majority vs. minority status or identity <ref type="bibr">(Hanni, 2017)</ref> Respondents then evaluated three pairs of countries, with each pair named Country A and Country B. For each country, we independently randomized the attribute-levels with equal probability under each attribute. We also randomized the order of attributes at the survey respondent level.</p><p>After seeing each country pair, respondents were asked: "If you had to choose, which country would you prefer to be born and grow up in?" Here, we implemented the standard forced-choice conjoint design by requiring respondents to choose either Country A or Country B <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bansak et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Hainmueller et al., 2014)</ref>. Because we recruited over 1,000 respondents in each country and each respondent completed the conjoint task three times, each country sample generated more than 6,000 (1, 000 × 3 × 2) observations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Estimation strategy</head><p>Following our pre-registration (available in SI Appendix Section M), we use linear regression to estimate the average marginal component effects (AMCEs) by regressing country selection on each attribute-level, with reference categories being the most desirable values and standard errors clustered at the respondent level. Each AMCE thus identifies the effect of an attribute-level on the likelihood that a country profile with that value is chosen relative to the most desirable value, after taking into account the possible effects of all other country attributes <ref type="bibr">(Bansak et al., 2021, p. 29)</ref>.</p><p>For the tradeoff analysis, we estimate the average component interaction effects (ACIEs) by following the estimation procedure described in <ref type="bibr">Hainmueller et al. (2014, p. 12)</ref>. That is, we interact each relevant pair of randomized attribute-levels in a linear regression, while controlling for other country attribute-levels and clustering the standard errors at the respondent level. We also include sample fixed effects, although removing them does not substantively change our estimates because there is surprisingly little treatment effect heterogeneity across countries in the first place.</p><p>The ACIE is a theoretically relevant quantity because it captures how people make decisions when regarding the public safety attribute, one concern may be that "very dangerous" may read particularly extreme. We do not consider it to be any more extreme than attribute-levels like choosing leaders through a military coup, severe government repression, or corruption existing "all the time." However, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> below, even if the public safety attribute was truncated at the "somewhat dangerous" level, it would still generate the second largest effect. confronted with (1) countries with high values of attribute A but low values of attribute B and (2) countries with low values of attribute A but high values of attribute B. If preferences for these countries are qualitatively similar, then people are making strong tradeoffs between the two attributes.</p><p>If preferences for the latter set of countries are even stronger than preferences for the former set, then people are prioritizing attribute B when making tradeoffs between the two attributes. As an alternative measure of tradeoffs, we also analyze the marginal rate of substitution for the democracy attributes relative to the outcomes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Advantages of the conjoint experimental design</head><p>We use a conjoint experimental design because it is particularly suitable for studying how individuals make tradeoffs in a multidimensional setting. While the literature suggests that the factors we examined in the experiment could independently tamp down individuals' commitment to democracy (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>), we know little about the extent to which these factors matter when multiple factors collide, as they would in the real world. Our forced-choice conjoint design allows us to examine whether and to what extent democracy "prevails" under the pressure of multiple important factors, and consequently evaluate how intensely people care about democracy in a contextually rich environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bansak et al., 2023)</ref>. The approach also allows us to capture the multidimensional nature of democracy by dividing it into three core components: leadership selection, civil liberties, and institutional checks. By independently randomizing the extent to which a country fulfills each defining feature of democracy, we unpack which aspect of democracy matters most to people, as well as what other aspects are more susceptible to tradeoffs.</p><p>In addition, our experiment enables us to sidestep potential endogeneity that is otherwise challenging to bypass in observational studies. In particular, existing research shows how the relationship between actual democracy and democratic attitudes is endogenous <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Dahlum &amp; Knutsen, 2017)</ref> and how individuals tend to assume that democracy comes with desirable governance outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">(Schedler &amp; Sarsfield, 2007)</ref>. Because our conjoint experiment not only incorporates various dimensions that matter to people's evaluation of political systems according to existing scholarship but also randomizes them separately, we can rule out reverse causality and further significantly mitigate the problem of information equivalence that is otherwise common in standard vignette-based experiments <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Dafoe et al., 2018)</ref>. Next, by incorporating many theoretically relevant attributes, the conjoint experiment also provides respondents with more reasons to justify why they make a particular choice. In an alternative design where researchers may directly ask respondents, for example, whether they are willing to prioritize being rich or being in the majority group rather than living in a democracy, respondents who are less committed to democracy may nonetheless self-report reluctance as it is a more socially desirable answer. The conjoint design allows them to mask their reasoning in a multidimensional setting (e.g., choosing countries based on "selfish" but socially frowned upon reasons like being rich or not being a minority), thereby mitigating potential social desirability bias <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Horiuchi et al., 2022)</ref> that could be particularly salient in the study of democratic norms <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">(Valentim, 2024)</ref>.</p><p>Finally, the question of how individuals make tradeoffs fundamentally taps into the process of comparison that lies at the heart of conjoint experiments: would people be willing to sacrifice certain desirable features of a regime (e.g., their country in the status quo) in exchange for other desirable features of another regime (e.g., their country after reform, a neighboring country they consider emigrating to)? Because conjoint experiments are particularly appropriate for analyzing how individuals make tradeoffs, several important contributions have exploited this method to study related questions-e.g., whether people would abandon democracy for partisan gains in hypothetical elections <ref type="bibr">(Frederiksen, 2024a;</ref><ref type="bibr">Graham &amp; Svolik, 2020)</ref>, how voters make tradeoffs across issue dimensions in stylized social democratic programs <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Abou-Chadi et al., 2025)</ref>, and how individuals value democratic elections relative to socioeconomic outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Adserà et al., 2023)</ref>. In the real world, and especially in authoritarian propaganda regarding democracy, political communication has also framed these various factors as tradeoffs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results: The Value of Democracy and the Dynamics of Tradeoffs Determinants of country preferences</head><p>We begin by analyzing the extent to which the ten factors above shape people's preferences for being born and growing up in a particular country. Here, we estimate the average marginal component effects (AMCEs) to identify the effect of an attribute-level on the likelihood that a country profile with that value is chosen, averaging across the effects of all other country attributes <ref type="bibr">(Bansak et al., 2020, p. 29)</ref>.</p><p>In examining the aggregate data from all six countries, we find that each factor contributes to people's evaluations to some extent, but leader selection and public safety matter the most (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Compared to a country with free and fair elections, respondents are less likely to select countries in which political leaders come to power via military coup, hereditary succession, determination by unelected elites, or unfair elections by about 14 to 21 percentage points (pp) (SE = 0.8 pp). People prefer countries that are very safe to those that are very dangerous by about 21 pp (SE = 0.7 pp).</p><p>People also value other dimensions of democracy but to a lesser extent than free and fair elections. They prefer countries with the freedom of expression and assembly over those in which these liberties are repressed by about 12 pp (SE = 0.6 pp). They also prefer countries with institutional checks and balances over those in which leaders can bypass the legislature and courts by about 7 pp (SE = 0.6 pp).</p><p>The effects of the other factors are generally as expected. Regarding the sociotropic factors, people prefer countries with low corruption, high-income levels, accessible health care, and fair treatment of minorities. Regarding individual factors, people also prefer to be in a country in which they are personally wealthy and not part of a minority group. Notably, people prioritize avoiding being personally poor over avoiding living in a poor country. However, all of these societal and personal factors exert a significantly smaller effect than the leadership selection and public safety attributes. When moving from the least to most desirable counterfactuals of any of these factors, the effect is less than 14 pp. For example, people prefer countries in which they are wealthy to those in which they are poor by 12 pp (SE = 0.6 pp). However, several of these effects-being Minority Second largest Majority (Respondent Identity) Mostly unfair Sometimes unfair Fairly treated (Minority Treatment) For the privileged Mostly accessible (Health Care) Prevalent Occasional Rare (Corruption in Politics) Very dangerous Somewhat dangerous Somewhat safe Very safe (Public Safety) Poor Average Wealthy (Respondent Wealth) Low income Middle income High income (National Economy) Unconstrained Partially constrained Constrained (Institutional Checks) Repressed Partially free Free (Civil Liberties) Military coup Hereditary succession Unelected elites Unfair elections Free and fair elections (Leader Selection) -0.20 -0.15 -0.10 -0.05 0.00 Effect on Pr(preferring to be born and grow up in the country)</p><p>Note: Estimates represent average marginal component effects. Due to an administrative error, Japanese respondents randomized to see the "somewhat dangerous" or "very dangerous" level saw both descriptors of the public safety attribute-level. In the pooled analysis, we put this level in the same category as "very dangerous." Error bars indicate 95% confidence intervals, calculated based on standard errors clustered at the individual level. Statistically significant estimates at the 0.05 level, upon adjustments for multiple comparisons using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure, are displayed in black. For tabular results, see Table <ref type="table">S5</ref>.</p><p>personally poor, or living in a country with prevalent corruption, inaccessible health care, or unfair treatment of minorities-are comparable to the effects associated with civil liberties and larger than the effects associated with institutional checks. These results indicate that civil liberties and institutional checks, unlike elections, are not strongly prioritized over sociotropic or individual outcomes.</p><p>Several pieces of additional analysis reinforce our main claim that leadership selection and pub-lic safety are the two most substantial factors, summarized here and fully described in the appendix.</p><p>First, leadership selection and public safety are the most salient attributes (SI Appendix Section B). 6   Second, in analyzing the specific levels of each attribute, "free and fair elections" within the leader selection attribute and "very dangerous" within the public safety attribute ranked top two (SI Appendix Section C). 7 People prioritize free and fair elections and avoiding very dangerous countries substantially more than they prioritize other political, economic, and social factors.</p><p>Third and fourth, we show that two potentially major sources of heterogeneity do not change our main conclusions: cross-national and cross-subject. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">2</ref> reports the AMCE estimates for each country separately (see also SI Appendix Sections A and D), and in SI Appendix Section E, we further group the data at the country level along other dimensions such as Asian vs. non-Asian countries and democracies vs. nondemocracies. These analyses show that while there are interesting differences across countries, discussed in detail in the appendix, the overall pattern in which leadership selection and public safety dominate all other attributes is robust. 8 We also find little to no evidence that people's preferences across these ten attributes differ across individuals, defined by demographic and ideological factors like their age, gender, education, socioeconomic status, identification as a minority, and self-reported political ideology (see SI Appendix Section F).</p><p>Thus, overall, the data reveal a robust pattern in which people strongly emphasize competitive elections and high public safety in their preferences among countries. Other factors, including the civil liberty and leadership constraint dimensions of democracy, also matter but to a lesser degree. These findings set the stage for our next set of analyses, which unpacks how people make 6. We follow <ref type="bibr">Clayton et al. (2021, p. 191</ref>) by measuring salience as "the average of the absolute value of the probability of choosing a profile with a particular attribute-level minus 0.5."</p><p>7. We use a method developed by <ref type="bibr">Dill et al. (2024)</ref> to assess the relative importance of each individual attribute-level in people's choices.</p><p>8. For example, contrary to the Asian values thesis (for a review, see <ref type="bibr">Welzel, 2011, pp. 2-4)</ref>, while respondents from Asian countries were more sensitive to avoiding dangerous countries, they valued the three components of democracy largely to the same relative magnitude as those from non-Asian countries.</p><p>Figure 2.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Tradeoffs for free and fair elections</head><p>In this section, we analyze the extent to which people will trade off free and fair elections to live in a safe society or to be personally wealthy. We specifically focus on safety and wealth because these two attributes were substantially and consistently influential as societal and individual-level factors in our previous analysis. In SI Appendix Sections G and H, we additionally analyze the extent to which people will neglect democracy for improving health care access and the national economy, since nondemocratic leaders also rely on these factors to justify the legitimacy of their regime <ref type="bibr">(Guriev &amp; Treisman, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr">Lu &amp; Chu, 2021)</ref>.</p><p>To streamline our analysis, we draw on the binary conceptualization of democracy standard in the classic literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Boix et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Cheibub et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Przeworski et al., 2000)</ref> and collapse the leader selection attribute into two levels: with or without free and fair elections. The latter category comprises unfair elections, unelected elites, hereditary succession, and military coups.</p><p>Because these features have similar AMCEs in the first place, disaggregating the analysis does not substantively change the results (see SI Appendix Section I).</p><p>To obtain direct estimates of how respondents make tradeoffs between attributes, we estimate the average component interaction effects (ACIEs) by interacting each pair of randomized attributes in a linear regression <ref type="bibr">(Hainmueller et al., 2014, p. 12)</ref>, while controlling for other country attributes, adding sample fixed effects, and clustering the standard errors at the respondent level.</p><p>This estimation allows us to directly assess how changing the nature of two potentially competing attributes affects people's preference for a country (see the Research Design section for more discussion on the ACIE). In SI Appendix Section K, we additionally show that all of our conclusions regarding respondent tradeoffs are robust to analyzing the marginal rate of substitution, mirroring the structural analysis by <ref type="bibr">Graham and Svolik (2020, pp. 403-404)</ref>.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref> reports the ACIE estimates based on the pooled sample of all six countries (also see Note: Estimates represent average component interaction effects upon controlling for other attributes and country fixed effects.

For tabular results, see Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">S12-S13</ref>.</p><p>SI Appendix Section I for the analyses by country). The baseline scenario is in the middle of Panel A, where a country has free and fair elections and is very dangerous. Moving down one step, we can see that respondents prefer an alternative country that lacks free and fair elections but is very safe by about 5 pp (SE = 1.2 pp, 95% CI [2.5, 7.4] pp). In other words, they are willing to give up elections to obtain a high level of safety. One step lower reveals that they are indifferent between the baseline scenario and an alternative country in which there are no free and fair elections but that</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">is somewhat safe (β = 0.3 pp, SE = 1.2 pp, 95% CI [-2.2, 2.7] pp).</formula><p>Any lower level of safety (i.e., somewhat dangerous or very dangerous) is less preferable. Lastly, notice that all four scenarios in which the country has no free and fair elections (bottom four estimates) are less likely to be chosen than a country that has free and fair elections but is "somewhat dangerous." These patterns suggest a high level of perceived insecurity is needed to induce people to abandon free and fair elections.</p><p>Turning to Panel B, we can see that people are generally unwilling to trade away democratic elections to become wealthier. More specifically, respondents are 4 pp less likely to prefer a country without free and fair elections where they would be wealthier than most, compared to a country with free and fair elections where they would be poorer than most (SE = 1.1 pp, 95% CI [-6.4, -2.0] pp). Thus, overall, the analysis indicates that when electoral institutions and individual wealth are at stake, respondents are more likely to prioritize the former. Our analysis in SI Appendix Sections G and H further indicates people's resistance to trading off elections for national economic performance or more accessible health care. This absence of a tradeoff for economic outcomes aligns with the finding from Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> in which public safety is the only outcome that is prioritized to the same extent as competitive elections.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Tradeoffs for civil liberties and institutional checks</head><p>We replicate the analysis for the other two dimensions of democracy: civil liberties and institutional checks. Overall, these analyses tell a more pessimistic story for the mass foundations of democratic resilience, as people are willing to forgo civil liberties and institutional checks and balances for a greater range of scenarios that improve public safety and their personal wealth.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref> shows how respondents trade off civil liberties for public safety and individual wealth.</p><p>People prefer countries that are very safe and in which the government represses civil liberties over countries that are very dangerous and in which civil liberties are strongly protected by about 9 pp (SE = 1.2 pp, 95% CI [6.5, 11.3] pp). People are also indifferent between countries that are somewhat safe with strong civil liberties and countries that are very safe with repression of civil liberties. In other words, they are willing to move from the highest to the lowest level of civil liberties to obtain an incremental improvement in safety.</p><p>Similarly, whereas people did not express a desire to give up democratic elections for personal wealth, they did reveal a preference for wealth at some cost to their civil liberties.

Using electoral, liberal, and institutional measurements for democracy, we find that these two groups make tradeoffs between democracy and other outcomes differently when it comes to wealth, but in similar ways when it comes to public safety. Those who purport to place a higher value on democracy are less willing to give up democracy for individual wealth (Figures S28 to S30), as one might expect. However, when it comes to public safety, these same individuals are willing to trade away democracy for improved safety at rates similar to those who do not say that democracy is an important value (Figures S25 to S27). These analyses indicate that strong expressive support for democracy does not necessarily align with an individual's willingness to trade away democracy, especially if public safety is perceived to be at stake.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>External Validity</head><p>We analyze observational evidence from existing surveys to probe the generalizability of our findings beyond the conjoint experiment setting. Because we aim to consider the tradeoff dynamics between democracy and public safety relative to other social, political, and economic outcomes, the ideal survey should include question items that confront respondents with such tradeoffs. The latest wave of the Asian Barometer Survey (ABS Wave 6) is the closest existing survey that meets this criterion. 9 Through face-to-face interviews with around 1,200 respondents in nine partnering country (Australia, Cambodia, Indonesia, Mongolia, the Philippines, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam), it asked: "Which if any of the following circumstances do you think would justify the government's use of emergency powers to constrain individual rights and freedoms, such as imposing curfew or censorship on social media?" The circumstances included (1) "a security crisis due to social unrest or terrorism," (2) "an economic crisis that has caused the loss of many jobs," and (3) "widespread corruption that the president (or prime minister) claims can only be reduced by increasing executive power." 10 The first circumstance reasonably maps onto the public 9. ABS enforces a unified research protocol (e.g., probabilistic sampling, standard survey instrument, quality control) for each country partner. For more information, see <ref type="url" target="https://www.asianbarometer.org/survey.html?page=s40">https://www.asianb  arometer.org/survey.html?page=s40</ref>.</p><p>10. Two other circumstances included in the survey were "a public health crisis like the Covid-19 pandemic" and "the country is at war." These situations, in our view, do not have direct mapping onto the dimensions included in our conjoint survey experiments and are therefore security attribute in our conjoint experiments, the second mirrors the national economy attribute, and the third corresponds to the corruption in politics attribute, whereas the government action at stake taps into the civil liberties dimension. The available answer options in each nationally representative survey ranged from "not at all justified" and "not very justified" to "somewhat justified" and "very justified." Higher perceived justifiability of the given circumstance thus indicates higher willingness to trade away a core element of liberal democracy for security gains, economic benefits, or corruption reductions.</p><p>We again find evidence that individuals generally find it more acceptable to constrain civil liberties for public safety than for economic and anti-corruption reasons. As Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6</ref> shows, in six of the nine countries, respondents rated security crises as a significantly stronger justification than economic crises or widespread corruption for the government to claim emergency powers that limit rights and freedoms. The exceptions are Cambodia, Indonesia, and the Philippines, whose citizens found constraining individual rights and freedoms on the grounds of public safety and national economy justifiable at comparable levels. Across nine countries, the rated justifiability of constraining rights and freedoms for security gains was at least 2.5 on a four-point scale, with many countries hitting close to or even over 3 (e.g., Australia, Mongolia, the Philippines, Taiwan, Vietnam). These countries cover a wide range of regime types and democratic experiences; yet, they yield largely consistent results about how willing people are to trade away civil liberties for public safety, compared to other desirable societal outcomes. The observational analysis thus aligns with our experimental findings and should strengthen confidence in their external validity.</p></div>

The overall estimates take the mean of the nine-country weighted estimates, but the overall empirical pattern holds even if we take out the outlier, Mongolia, from the analysis.</p><p>a particularly unsafe country, and they are even more willing to abandon civil liberties and institutional checks on executive power for either safety or personal wealth. These results are relatively consistent across the six, diverse countries surveyed in our study, suggesting that similar factors will shape commitment to democracy even in societies that differ substantially from each other.</p><p>These findings have implications for understanding commitment to democracy around the world at a moment of democratic erosion. They illustrate how people across a range of countries value free and fair elections strongly, even relative to important substantive outcomes produced by their political systems. The public is unlikely to willingly give up competitive elections in exchange for economic growth, accessible public goods, or a lack of corruption. This finding should weaken skepticism that people do not weigh democratic procedures heavily in terms of how they evaluate their political systems (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Rothstein, 2009)</ref>. Our results also contrast somewhat with recent experimental studies that focus on support for pro-or anti-democratic candidates in elections (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Frederiksen, 2024a;</ref><ref type="bibr">Graham &amp; Svolik, 2020)</ref>. These studies are more pessimistic about the public's commitment to democracy, as they tend to find that many people are willing to vote for candidates who engage in democratic violations if those candidates support their partisan preferences.</p><p>One possible synthesis of these findings is that people believe individual violations by specific candidates are unlikely to weaken the country's democracy, and so they are more willing to accept democratic tradeoffs in what they perceive to be narrow circumstances, even as they remain strongly committed to free and fair elections in their countries more broadly. This dynamic would explain how backsliders can avoid backlash from pro-democracy supporters when they move gradually, as well as why more general perceptions of free and fair elections may motivate politically impactful forms of opposition other than changing one's vote choice, such as protesting, engaging in civil disobedience, or demanding that undemocratic incumbents be removed from office <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Gamboa, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr">Yeung, forthcoming)</ref>.</p><p>Yet, our study also sheds new light on the conditions that weaken people's commitment to democracy. First, the fact that people care relatively less about civil liberties and, particularly, institutional checks suggests that political leaders engaged in democratic backsliding will confront less popular backlash for undermining these aspects of the political system. Our tradeoff findings relating to civil liberties and institutional checks also imply that the likelihood of popular resistance will be especially low if political leaders can convince the public that constraints on their power or protections for dissidents are standing in the way of improved economic and social outcomes. This implication is consistent with research showing how people abandon their civil liberties when faced with security threats <ref type="bibr">(Berinsky, 2009, Chapter 7)</ref>, and how majoritarianism allows incumbents to undermine checks and balances without much backlash among some voters <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Gidron et al., 2025;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Grossman et al., 2022)</ref>. It also reflects findings from related conjoint studies showing that civil liberties and institutional constraints are valued less and seen as less crucial for democracy than free and fair elections <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Ferrer et al., 2025;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Neundorf et al., 2024)</ref>. Furthermore, these findings are reflected in several prominent cases of democratic backsliding. Whether Erdogan in Turkey, Chávez in Venezuela, Saied in Tunisia, Orbán in Hungary, Trump in the United States, or Modi in India, would-be autocrats have claimed democratic legitimacy through their electoral victories, while demonizing the opposition as threatening and decrying institutional checks as stifling to justify the weakening of civil liberties and constraints on executive power (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Stokes, 2025)</ref>.</p><p>In terms of whether sociotropic or personal economic circumstances are more likely to affect support for democracy, our findings suggest that people will place more weight on their own economic situation than on the national economy. The negative effect of being poor was larger than the effect of living in a poor country, and personal poverty was also more likely than country-level poverty to induce respondents to trade away civil liberties and institutional checks.</p><p>Our results contrast with recent studies of democratic support that use a similar conjoint design.</p><p>First, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Adserà et al. (2023)</ref> show that most people are only willing to trade away free and fair elections for very large gains in their personal income. This finding reflects the robustness of elections in our study. However, they do not simultaneously assess people's commitments to civil liberties and executive constraints, and our incorporation of these two elements reveals where commitment to democratic governance is the weakest. Second, <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Neundorf et al. (2024)</ref> find no effect of high crime rates and relatively little public willingness to trade off elements of democracy for low crime rates. This sharp divergence from our findings could reflect our language of countries being "safe" or "unsafe" compared to their language about "crime rates," which we consider a more abstract concept for the everyday citizen. The contrasting findings may also result from our use of a four-point scale for this attribute compared to their use of a binary distinction between low and high crime rates, as the willingness to trade off free and fair elections activates when countries in our conjoint were described as "very unsafe." Our robust finding about "very unsafe" societies speaks to a real-world phenomenon in which autocratic governments portray democratic societies as crime-ridden and dangerous, and is further corroborated by established macro-level research discussed below.</p><p>In establishing public safety as the substantive outcome that is most likely to weaken the public's commitment to democracy, our results have implications for democratic transitions. Countries experiencing a democratic opening often struggle with several major challenges stemming from the political upheaval that led to the transition <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Abadeer et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Neumayer, 2003)</ref>. Economic outcomes, corruption, public services, and security frequently worsen at least in the short term (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Papaiouannou &amp; Siourounis, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">Rock, 2009)</ref>, and these declines are often emphasized by counterrevolutionary forces seeking to turn the public against the country's nascent democracy.</p><p>Our results suggest that transitional leaders beset by multiple, difficult challenges will be best positioned to protect democratic gains if they can reduce social instability and hold down violent crime.</p><p>Our findings on public safety also help to make sense of the content of propaganda in authoritarian regimes. Authoritarian rulers have long understood and exploited the psychological primacy of fear, particularly fear of physical insecurity, to justify centralizing power <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Hobbes, 1651)</ref>. To weaponize this fear and undermine the appeal of democracy, autocracies like China often emphasize crime and instability in the United States and other democratic countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Chester, 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Chester &amp; Wong, 2025;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Deng, 2025)</ref>. Our results align with research suggesting that such messages can be successful at weakening people's support for democracy <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Mattingly et al., 2024)</ref> and diminishing public demands for democratic reform <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Deng, 2025)</ref>. As a result, democratic countries that aim to preserve the global appeal of democracy should emphasize that public safety is often higher in established democracies <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Lafree &amp; Tseloni, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Piccone, 2017)</ref>.</p><p>An important question about democratic support is whether some social and economic groups are more committed to democracy than others. For instance, recent studies suggest that young people are less invested in democracy and less likely to punish politicians who violate democratic norms <ref type="bibr">(Frederiksen, 2024b)</ref>. Other research implies that poorer people living in democracies will be less supportive of democracy, whereas poorer people living in autocracies will be more support-ive of democracy <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Ceka &amp; Magalhães, 2020)</ref>. However, our results push back against the idea that poverty uniformly makes people reject their own political system, or that younger people are much less committed to democracy. Instead, respondents in our study responded similarly to democratic tradeoffs regardless of their individual characteristics. In other words, our work implies that broad segments of society in a range of countries around the world remain highly committed to competitive elections, even as they are also somewhat willing to trade away civil liberties and executive constraints for better economic and social outcomes.</p></div>

We then identify the second-ranked feature f 2 , but using only strategy pairs in which f 1 is either absent or invariant. For this subsample we proceed [by] estimating "nested" marginal means to delineate f 2 . Again only keeping pairs without variation in f 2 , we proceed in the same manner until all features are ranked. This disaggregation and ranking method through "nested" marginal means has the advantage of mitigating the potential issue of sensitive AMCE estimates due to "the co-occurrence rate of unrelated, yet substantively important, attributes" <ref type="bibr">(Dill, Howlett, and</ref><ref type="bibr">Müller-Crepon 2024, 1462</ref>; see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">Abramson, Koçak, and Magazinnik 2022)</ref>.</p><p>We show the full ranking derived from this estimation procedure in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">S1</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E Heterogeneity by Country Characteristics</head><p>Some political theorists and pundits have asserted that democracy is not compatible with the Asian culture or contended that Asians, given their distinct cultural roots, understand democracy very differently (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">Diamond, Plattner, and Chu 2013)</ref>. Others focus on the institutional structure rather than the culture of the country, arguing that people can "form attitudes to democracy based upon what they learn about what it is and does" <ref type="bibr">(Mattes and Bratton 2007, 192)</ref>. In this appendix, we explore whether people make tradeoffs differently when they come from a different cultural background or when they have different experience with democracy.</p><p>To investigate the cultural dimension, we estimate the marginal means of different attributelevels in our conjoint experiment, while separating the estimation by Asian and non-Asian countries. If the marginal means are similar in Asian and non-Asian countries, we will have weak evidence that the Asian culture plays an important role in shaping whether and how which people value democracy over other country attributes. As Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">S8</ref> shows, there is limited heterogeneity between respondents from Asian and non-Asian countries, casting doubt on the popular notion that people living in Asian societies value democracy less and are therefore willing to trade away democratic governance.</p><p>To examine the institutional dimension, we again estimate the marginal means of different attribute-levels, while separating the estimation by democracies and nondemocracies. Based on V-Dem's Electoral Democracy Index in 2023, we classify the United States, Italy, and Japan as democracies, and India, Thailand, and Egypt as nondemocracies. As Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">S9</ref> shows, respondents from democracies and nondemocracies emphasize very similar features of countries (e.g., free and fair election, public safety) in their country selection, suggesting that (across the six diverse countries we sampled) regime type does not play an important role in shaping how people make tradeoffs about countries.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I Additional Analysis of Tradeoffs for Democracy</head><p>In the main text, we streamlined our analysis by collapsing the leader selection attribute into two levels-with or without free and fair elections. We also presented average component interaction effect estimates based on the pooled sample, which, while conducive to substantive interpretation given our purposes, could be sensitive to alternative specifications of reference categories. To further probe the robustness of our results in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">2</ref>, we estimate the marginal means by country without collapsing the leader selection attribute (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S17</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S18</ref>). We conduct the same analysis for the tradeoffs between civil liberties and public safety or individual wealth <ref type="bibr">(Figures S19 and S20)</ref>, as well as between leader constraints and public safety or individual wealth <ref type="bibr">(Figures S21 and S22)</ref>, showing country-level marginal mean estimates that corroborate our results in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref> and 4.</p><p>We further explore whether group status interacts with the aspects of democracy people care about. If an individual knows their group is dominant, they may care less about equal treatment of minorities and more about elections; alternatively, if they know they are minoritized, they may care more about equal treatment and civil liberties. One empirical implication of such dynamics is that the AMCE of free and fair elections (or free civil liberties) will be higher (or lower) among respondents who evaluate the country that would put them in the majority group than among respondents who evaluate the country that would put them in the minority group. To explore these dynamics, we again collapse the leader selection attribute into binary levels and estimate the full sets of AMCEs conditional on the (randomized) respondent identity-majority vs. minority-in the hypothetical country. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_25">S23</ref> shows the estimates. We find no evidence of this empirical implication. Regardless of whether respondents will be placed in the majority or minority group, free and fair elections make them 17.6 pp more likely to prefer to be born and grow up in the country compared to a one that will give them the same group status but does not have free and fair elections. In addition, regardless of whether respondents will be placed in the majority or minority group, free civil liberties make them 11.4 to 11.5 pp more likely to select the country compared to a one that will give them the same group status but represses civil liberties.

To measure importance of democracy, we asked the following question: "How important is it for you to live in a country that is governed democratically?" The answer choices ranged from 1 ("not at all important") to 10 ("absolutely important"). Overall, our respondents strongly valued democracy, consistent with findings from existing nationally representative surveys. The sample mean in our six-country surveys is 8.86 (SD = 1.76), with a median of 10.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>K Analysis of Marginal Rates of Substitution</head><p>This appendix explains the idea, procedure, results, and implications of the marginal rate of substitution (MRS) analysis. This analysis is exploratory.</p><p>MRS is an economic concept that quantifies the tradeoff an individual (typically a consumer) is willing to make between two goods. It is the rate at which an individual is willing to trade one good for another while maintaining a constant level of utility (or satisfaction). In technical terms, it captures the slope of the indifference curve at a given point and thus reflects the individual's relative valuation of the two goods. An MRS of 1.5, for example, means that an individual is willing to give up 1.5 units of Y (a desirable good) to trade for one more unit of X (another desirable good)</p><p>without feeling better or worse off.</p><p>We apply this concept to our experimental data to quantify the tradeoffs that our respondents were willing to make for socioeconomic goods (e.g., national economy, public safety) vis-à-vis democracy attributes (e.g., leadership selection, civil liberties). Specifically, we estimate the MRS of each socioeconomic good for each democracy attribute. Therefore, the MRS of national economy for civil liberties, for example, is the amount of civil liberties respondents were willing to give up in exchange for an additional unit of national economy improvement. In an absolute sense, this quantity is less informative because the substantive meaning of 0.58 more units of civil liberties, for example, is not well defined. Yet it is meaningful for our tradeoff analysis because our application here is relative: we compare different MRSs to identify which socioeconomic goods are particularly influential in inducing respondents' tradeoffs against democracy. The higher the MRS, the higher the respondents' willingness to trade away democracy for the given socioeconomic good.</p><p>We follow <ref type="bibr">Graham and Svolik (2020, 403)</ref> by estimating the random utility model of discrete choice: Pr(i chooses Country A) = logit -1 [α + β 1 Democracy + β 2 Economy + β 3 Wealth + β 4 Sa f ety + β 5 Corruption + β 6 Healthcare + β 7 Minority + β 8 Identity], where we fix Country A to be less democratic than, or as democratic as, Country B in the democracy attribute of interest. 3 Democracy is the difference between Country A and Country B's democracy attribute in leadership selection, civil liberties, or institutional checks. Economy, Wealth, Safety, Corruption, Healthcare, Minority, and Identity are differences between Country A and Country B's national economy, respondent wealth, public safety, corruption in politics, health care, minority treatment, and respondent identity-as randomized in our conjoint experiments.</p><p>Because the attributes did not share the same number of levels in our design, we standardize all input variables by rescaling them to range from 0 to 1. 4 In addition, α indicates sample fixed effects. However, estimating the coefficients without sample fixed effects or with a linear probability model does not substantively change the results.</p><p>Table S2 presents our MRS estimates, obtained by dividing β 1 by β k as estimated from the random utility model, where k = 2, . . . , 8. Table S2. Marginal rate of substitution estimates (β 1 /β k ) β 1 : leadership selection β 1 : civil liberties β 1 : institutional checks β 2 : national economy 0.42 0.58 0.99 β 3 : respondent wealth 0.60 0.81 1.38 β 4 : public safety 1.05 1.43 2.45 β 5 : corruption in politics 0.61 0.84 1.44 β 6 : health care 0.54 0.73 1.25 β 7 : minority treatment 0.52 0.70 1.18 β 8 : respondent identity 0.20 0.27 0.47 Note: A higher MRS indicates higher willingness to trade away the given democracy attribute for the given socioeconomic good.</p><p>Two empirical patterns emerge. First, by comparing the MRS estimates in each column, we 3. We reshape our data for this analysis by following Graham and Svolik (2020).</p><p>4. For example, for the national economy attribute, we code "low income," "middle income," and "high income" as 0, 1/2, and 1; for the public safety attribute, we code "very dangerous," "somewhat dangerous," "somewhat safe," and "very safe" as 0, 1/3, 2/3, and 1. Thus, binary variables-including leadership selection which we binarize for this MRS analysis-need no standardization. We do not use <ref type="bibr">Graham and Svolik's (2020, 403)</ref> standardization methodi.e., dividing input variables by twice their standard deviation-because our discrete scales have limited categories (four at most).</p><p>find that public safety consistently has the highest MRS for each of the three democracy attributes.</p><p>This result indicates that among the seven socioeconomic goods we incorporated in our design, public safety is the one that made our respondents most willing to trade away democracy for.</p><p>Second, by comparing the MRS estimates in each row, we find that free and fair elections have the lowest MRS-and institutional checks the highest MRS-for any given socioeconomic good.</p><p>This result implies that respondents' commitment to free and fair elections is more robust, while institutional checks are more susceptible to tradeoffs against socioeconomic goods. Overall, these results corroborate our findings from the average component interaction effect analysis as reported in the main text, as well as our attribute salience analysis in SI Appendix Section B and ranking analysis in SI Appendix Section C.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>M.1 Hypothesis</head><p>We are interested in understanding the conditions under which individuals become less committed to democracy, as well as the features of democracy that are more vulnerable to losing popular support. We will use a conjoint experiment to assess these questions. The conjoint includes three attributes that reflect core components of democracy: how the leader is selected, the extent of the leader's powers, and whether civil liberties are protected. The conjoint also includes attributes relating to economic and social outcomes in these countries. Some of these attributes are about the country as a whole, and others are about the outcomes experienced directly by the individual answering the survey. Given this approach, we do not have specific hypotheses or predictions about any particular attribute of the conjoint "mattering more" than another, but instead we explore agnostically the attributes citizens prioritize. In analyzing the conjoint, we will assess the following:</p><p>• First, how do the coefficients of the democracy attributes compare to the coefficients of the economic and social attributes? How do they compare to the national versus individual level attributes?</p><p>• Second, how do the economic and social attributes interact with the democracy attributes?</p><p>Does the influence of the democracy attributes weaken, for instance, when people know they or the country would be poorer, or when they know that they would be part of a poorly-treated minority group?</p><p>In addition, we plan to assess whether certain types of individuals are more or less committed to democracy, and whether economic and social outcomes have different effects on democratic support across these different individuals. For example, do poorer respondents place less emphasis on democracy based on the individual and national level attributes pertaining to the economy? Are members of minority groups particularly committed to civil liberties? Are people who understand democracy in majoritarian terms less committed to civil liberties and institutional constraints on power, especially when the economic and social attributes reflect desirable policy outcomes?</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>M.2 Dependent variable</head><p>After reviewing the two country profiles for each conjoint exercise, respondents are asked the following:</p><p>• "If you had to choose, which country would you prefer to be born and grow up in?" (Country A or Country B).</p><p>• "Now just think about Country A. How happy would you be to have been born and grown up in this country?" (1 to 7 scale).</p><p>• "Now just think about Country B. How happy would you be to have been born and grown up in this country?" (1 to 7 scale).</p><p>We will use the forced choice outcome as our primary dependent variable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>M.3 Conditions</head><p>The conjoint includes the following ten attributes, each of which is randomized independently. The order of the attributes is randomized.</p><p>1. Political leaders come to power through. . . (Free and fair elections / Unfair elections / Hereditary succession / A small group of unelected elites / Military coups) 2. In politics, people. . . (Can express themselves and organize freely / Can express themselves and organize but face some risk of government repression / Cannot express themselves and organize without severe government repression) 3. The country's leader. . . (Must respect the legislature and courts' authority / Can sometimes bypass the legislature and courts' authority / Can almost always bypass the legislature and courts' authority) 4. Political leaders engage in corruption. . . (All the time / Sometimes / Very rarely) 5. Economically, this country is. . . (Low-income / Medium-income / High-income) 6. Your personal wealth compared to others in this country would be. . . (Poorer than most / About average / Wealthier than most) 7. In terms of crime and public safety, the country is. . . (Very safe / Somewhat safe / Somewhat dangerous / Very dangerous) 8. High quality health care is. . . (Accessible to most people / Accessible only to people with money or connections) 9. Ethnic/Racial/Religious minorities are. . . (Treated fairly by most people / Treated fairly by some people but unfairly by others / Treated unfairly by most people) 10. Your ethnicity/race/religion would. . . (Put you in the largest majority group, Put you in the second largest group, Put you in the smallest minority group)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>M.4 Analyses</head><p>We will analyze the average marginal component effects of each attribute value against the reference categories. We will use the most desirable value as the reference category for each attributei.e. the most democratic, the best economic outcomes, the preferable social outcomes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>M.5 Outliers and Exclusion</head><p>We will not exclude any outliers or observations; however, for analyzing robustness we may check to see any indicators of poor survey response quality such as failing attention check, straight-lining through questions, and/or speeding.</p><p>Table S24.

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_13"><head>Figure 2</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Figure2in the main text reports the AMCE estimates for each of six countries. This appendix explains the results in greater detail. First, we find that democratic institutions play an important role in shaping respondents' choice. Compared to a country with free and fair elections, respondents are less likely to select a country with unfair elections by 16 to 21 percentage points (pp): 16 pp among Egyptians (SE = 0.019), 17 pp among Indians (SE = 0.019) and Japanese (SE = 0.019), 19 pp among Americans (SE = 0.019) and Italians (SE = 0.019), and 21 pp among Thai (SE = 0.019).The negative effects are substantively similar for other systems of leader selection where political leaders come to power through hereditary succession, a small group of unelected elites, or military coups. Among respondents from six different countries, the only substantive deviation comes from Egypt, where the features of unelected elites and hereditary succession have a somewhat milder impact on country preferences: Egyptian respondents are 7 pp (SE = 0.020) or 8 pp (SE = 0.020) less likely to prefer a country with unelected elites or hereditary succession, respectively, relative to a country with free and fair elections. Overall, leader selection is a crucial factor shaping people's country preferences in our diverse, six-country sample.On top of leader selection, two other features central to democracy-civil liberties and leader constraints-also influence respondents' choice. The relative importance of these attributes, however, varies more widely between countries and is generally less substantial compared to leader selection procedures. Compared to a country where people can express themselves and organize freely in politics, respondents are 5 to 17 pp less likely to select a country where people cannot express themselves and organize without severe government repression: 5 pp among Indians (SE = 0.16), 10 pp among Egyptians (SE = 0.015), 12 pp among Thai (SE = 0.014), 13 pp among Japanese (SE = 0.015), 14 pp among Italians (SE = 0.015), and 17 pp among Americans (SE = 0.015). For leader constraints, respondents are only 2 to 10 pp less likely to select the country when its leader can almost always bypass the legislature and courts' authority, relative to a country where the leader must respect the legislature and courts' authority. The negative effect is smallest among Japanese (2 pp, SE = 0.015), modest among Americans (5 pp, SE = 0.015), and</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_14"><figDesc>14 pp among Egyptians (SE = 0.018), 18 pp among Italians (SE = 0.017), 22 pp among Indians (SE = 0.018), and 24 pp among Americans (SE = 0.017), Japanese (SE = 0.015), 2 and Thai (SE = 0.017). Moving from "very safe" to "somewhat dangerous" also lowers the likelihood of country selection by around 8 to 16 pp. Corruption generates similar effects. Respondents are 9 to 15 pp less likely to select a country where political leaders engage in corruption all the time, relative to a country where such corruption takes place only rarely. The decreases in likelihood are 9 pp among Japanese (SE = 0.014), 11 pp among Indians (SE = 0.015), 12 pp among Italians (SE = 0.015), 13 pp among Egyptians (SE = 0.016), and 15 pp among Americans (SE = 0.014) and Thai (SE = 0.015). On top of public safety and corruption, how the country performs economically, how accessible high-quality health care is in the country, and how minorities are treated also affect people's choice (Figure2). Hypothetical circumstances of the individual have additional roles to play. In terms of economic situations, people are 5 to 18 pp less likely to select the country when their personal wealth would be poorer than most-rather than wealthier than most-in the country: 5 pp among Indians (SE = 0.015), 11 pp among Italians (SE = 0.015), 12 pp among Americans (SE = 0.015) and Egyptians (SE = 0.015), 13 pp among Thai (SE = 0.015), and 18 pp among Japanese (SE = 0.015). Minority status matters to a lesser extent. Shifting from being in the largest majority group to being in the smallest minority group only reduces likelihood of country selection by 2 to 5 pp in our six-country sample.</figDesc></figure>
