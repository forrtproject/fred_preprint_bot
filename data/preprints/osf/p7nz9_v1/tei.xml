<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Language models have achieved unprecedented levels of performance in natural language processing tasks, driven by advancements in deep learning and the availability of large-scale datasets. However, a significant challenge that persists within the deployment of such models, particularly large language models (LLMs), is the phenomenon of inference hallucination. This issue manifests when an LLM generates content that is not grounded in the input data or real-world knowledge, leading to outputs that can be factually incorrect, misleading, or entirely fabricated. The repercussions of hallucinations are particularly critical in applications requiring high levels of accuracy and reliability, such as automated content generation, summarization, and conversational agents.</p><p>Addressing the problem of hallucination is motivated by the need for more dependable AI systems capable of generating text that users can trust. Hallucinations undermine the credibility of LLMs and limit their utility in professional and academic settings where precision is paramount. Previous research has primarily focused on improving training data quality, refining model architectures, or incorporating postprocessing steps to mitigate hallucinations. While these methods have shown varying degrees of success, the core issue often remains unaddressed due to the inherent complexity of contextual understanding and positional encoding within LLMs.</p><p>Contextual positional encoding has emerged as a promising approach to enhance the fidelity of LLMs. Traditional positional encoding methods, integral to the transformer architecture, assign a unique positional vector to each token based on its position within the sequence. This approach, however, does not account for the dynamic nature of language, where the meaning of a word can be influenced significantly by its surrounding context. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel technique known as contextual positional double encoding. This method extends the conventional positional encoding by introducing an additional encoding vector that captures the contextual relationships among tokens in a sentence.</p><p>Our research modifies the open-source GPT-Neo model to incorporate contextual positional double encoding. This modification aims to provide a better understanding of token positions by considering both their static positions and their context within the sequence. Through this dual encoding mechanism, the model gains enhanced capabilities to discern subtle contextual cues that traditional methods may overlook, thus reducing the likelihood of generating hallucinatory content. The effectiveness of this approach is evaluated through comprehensive training and testing on a large corpus of text data, focusing on metrics that quantify both general performance and the incidence of hallucinations.</p><p>The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: We first review the existing literature on methods to mitigate hallucinations in LLMs and discuss related positional encoding techniques. Next, we detail the methodology of our proposed approach, including the architectural modifications to GPT-Neo and the implementation of contextual positional double encoding. This is followed by an evaluation section where we present the quantitative and qualitative results of our experiments. Finally, we discuss the implications of our findings, including potential limitations and avenues for future research, before concluding with a summary of our contributions to the field of natural language processing.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Model Architecture</head><p>The modifications to the GPT-Neo architecture were designed to incorporate the contextual positional double encoding mechanism, aiming to enhance the model's contextual awareness and reduce hallucinations. The original architecture of GPT-Neo consisted of multiple transformer layers, each utilizing multi-head self-attention and feed-forward neural networks to process input sequences. To integrate the contextual positional double encoding, an additional encoding layer was introduced, which computed two distinct positional vectors for each token: one representing the standard positional information and another capturing the contextual relationships among tokens. The modified architecture included a preprocessing module to dynamically update the contextual positional encodings based on the evolving context of the input sequence. This preprocessing module interfaced with the existing transformer layers, providing enriched positional information to the self-attention mechanism, thereby improving the model's ability to discern subtle contextual cues. The enhanced architecture aimed to maintain the balance between computational efficiency and increased contextual understanding, leveraging the dual positional encoding to mitigate the generation of hallucinatory content. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> visually represents the integration of the contextual positional double encoding layer with the existing transformer blocks, highlighting the flow of information through the modified model.</p></div>

To extend this approach, the contextual positional encoding calculated an additional vector that captured the relationships between the token and its surrounding context. The encoding mechanism utilized a combination of attention scores and context-aware embeddings to dynamically update the contextual positional vector for each token during the forward pass. Mathematically, the standard positional encoding vector P i for token i was defined through a sinusoidal function, while the contextual positional vector C i was computed through a weighted sum of attention scores and contextual embeddings from the preceding tokens. The combined positional representation E i for token i was given through the sum of P i and C i , providing a richer positional context. The following pseudocode outlines the algorithm for contextual positional double encoding: Algorithm 1 Contextual Positional Double Encoding 1: Initialize standard positional encoding P i for each token i 2: Initialize empty contextual positional encoding C i for each token i 3: for each token i in sequence do</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Discussion</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Impact of Contextual Positional Encoding on Hallucinations</head><p>The integration of contextual positional double encoding significantly reduced the incidence of hallucinations in the modified GPT-Neo model through enhanced contextual awareness and positional understanding. The dual encoding mechanism provided a comprehensive representation of token positions, considering both their static placement within the sequence and their dynamic relationships with surrounding tokens. This richer contextual embedding allowed the model to generate text that maintained a higher degree of factual accuracy and coherence. The reduction in hallucination frequency, as evidenced through both quantitative metrics and qualitative assessments, demonstrated the effectiveness of this approach. The modified model demonstrated an improved ability to discern contextually relevant information, leading to outputs that were more aligned with real-world knowledge and less prone to fabrication. This advancement marked a substantial step forward in addressing one of the most persistent challenges in natural language processing, highlighting the potential of contextual enhancements in improving model reliability.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Component Contribution Through Ablation Studies</head><p>Ablation studies were conducted to isolate and quantify the contributions of each component within the contextual positional double encoding framework. By systematically removing or modifying specific elements of the encoding mechanism, the impact on overall model performance and hallucination reduction was assessed. The studies revealed that the contextual positional vector, derived through dynamic attention mechanisms, played a crucial role in enhancing the model's contextual understanding.</p><p>Removal of this component resulted in a marked increase in hallucination frequency, indicating its critical function in maintaining factual accuracy. Similarly, the preprocessing module that integrated the standard and contextual positional encodings was found to be essential for effective information flow within the model architecture. Without this module, the self-attention mechanism's ability to leverage enriched positional information was significantly impaired, leading to degraded performance. These findings highlighted the synergistic effects of the dual encoding components, emphasizing the necessity of each part in achieving the observed improvements in model robustness and reliability.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Challenges and Constraints of the Current Approach</head><p>Despite the promising results, several limitations of the current approach were identified, reflecting the inherent challenges in developing advanced natural language models. One primary constraint was the increased computational overhead introduced through the additional encoding layer and preprocessing module. While the dual encoding mechanism enhanced contextual awareness, it also required more extensive computational resources and longer training times, potentially limiting its scalability for larger models or more extensive datasets. Another challenge was the potential for overfitting, particularly when fine-tuning the model on domain-specific sub-datasets.</p><p>Ensuring that the model generalizes well across diverse contexts without losing its enhanced contextual capabilities required careful balancing of training parameters and data diversity. Additionally, the reliance on large-scale text corpora for training posed challenges in maintaining data quality and relevance, as noisy or biased data could adversely impact model performance. Addressing these constraints will be crucial for further refining the approach and ensuring its practical applicability in various real-world scenarios.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">Exploration of Future Research Directions</head><p>Future research could explore several avenues to build on the advancements achieved through contextual positional double encoding. One potential direction involves the development of more efficient encoding mechanisms that reduce computational overhead while retaining enhanced contextual awareness. Techniques such as knowledge distillation or model pruning could be employed to create more lightweight models that maintain high performance. Another promising area of research is the integration of external knowledge bases or ontologies into the encoding framework, providing additional contextual grounding that further reduces the likelihood of hallucinations. Additionally, expanding the training datasets to include more diverse and multilingual corpora could enhance the model's ability to generalize across different languages and cultural contexts, broadening its applicability. Investigating the use of reinforcement learning techniques to dynamically adjust encoding parameters during inference could also offer new insights into optimizing model performance. These future directions highlight the ongoing potential for innovation in the field of natural language processing, driven through the continuous refinement of encoding techniques and model architectures.</p></div>
