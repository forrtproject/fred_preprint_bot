<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Age differences in cognitive performance have been shown to be overestimated if age-related hearing loss is not taken into account. Here, we investigated the role of age-related hearing loss on age differences in functional brain organization by assessing its impact on previously reported age differences in neural differentiation. To this end, we analyzed the data of 36 younger adults, 21 older adults with clinically normal hearing, and 21 older adults with mild-to-moderate hearing loss who had taken part in a functional localizer task comprising visual (i.e., faces, scenes) and auditory stimuli (i.e., voices, music) while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging. Evidence for reduced neural distinctiveness in the auditory cortex was observed only in older adults with hearing loss relative to younger adults, whereas evidence for reduced neural distinctiveness in the visual cortex was observed both in older adults with normal hearing and in older adults with hearing loss relative to younger adults. These results indicate that age-related dedifferentiation in the auditory cortex is exacerbated by age-related hearing loss.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Aging has long been shown to be associated with reduced neural differentiation, particularly within the ventral visual cortex (for recent reviews, see <ref type="bibr">Koen &amp; Rugg, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Koen et al., 2020)</ref>. For example, studies using univariate analysis approaches have revealed that occipitotemporal regions that are specialized in processing certain visual stimulus categories (e.g., faces, scenes) show reduced neural selectivity in older adults as compared to younger adults <ref type="bibr">(Koen et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">D. C. Park et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">J. Park et al., 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">J. Park et al., , 2012;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Payer et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Srokova et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Voss et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Zebrowitz et al., 2016)</ref>. Studies using multivariate analysis approaches have replicated and extended these findings, by showing that cortical response patterns elicited by different visual stimulus categories become less distinctive with age (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Carp, Park, Polk, et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Chamberlain et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr">Koen et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">J. Park et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Simmonite &amp; Polk, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Srokova et al., 2020)</ref>. Although the vast majority of studies have focused on visually responsive regions, similar findings have been reported in the motor <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Cassady et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Carp, Park, Hebrank, et al., 2011</ref>; see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Simmonite &amp; Polk, 2022)</ref> and auditory cortices <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Lalwani et al., 2019</ref>; see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Simmonite &amp; Polk, 2022)</ref>, suggesting that age-related dedifferentiation extends across sensory and motor cortical systems.</p><p>Age-related reductions in the distinctiveness of neural representations have been proposed to be an important determinant of age-related cognitive decline <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Li &amp; Rieckmann, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Li &amp; Sikström, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Li et al., 2001)</ref>.</p><p>Consistent with this possibility, J. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Park et al. (2010)</ref> found that neural selectivity in the ventral visual cortex significantly predicted performance on a number of cognitive tasks examining fluid processing abilities (e.g., digit symbol substitution test, trail making test, verbal fluency) in a sample of older adults (see also <ref type="bibr">Koen et al., 2019)</ref>. Furthermore, whereas age alone explained ~1% of the variance in a composite measure of fluid processing ability, adding neural selectivity explained an additional ~31% of the variance in fluid processing ability (J. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Park et al., 2010)</ref>. Similarly, a significant positive correlation between neural selectivity in the ventral visual cortex and performance on subsequent recognition memory tests has been recently shown in some studies <ref type="bibr">(Koen et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Srokova et al., 2020</ref>; see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Berron et al., 2018)</ref>. Interestingly, these correlations are not only observed in older adults but also in younger adults <ref type="bibr">(Koen et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Srokova et al., 2020</ref>; but see <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Berron et al., 2018)</ref>, suggesting that differences in neural selectivity within the ventral visual cortex may predict differences in cognitive performance regardless of age. Importantly, a number of studies have provided evidence for greater cognitive decline among older adults with age-related hearing loss (for recent reviews, see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Griffiths et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Slade et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Accordingly, meta-analyses have shown that age-related hearing loss is associated with poorer performance in several cognitive domains, including processing speed, memory, and executive functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Loughrey et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Taljaard et al., 2015)</ref>, as well as with poorer global cognitive function and increased risk of dementia <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Ford et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Loughrey et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Wei et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Yuan et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Zheng et al., 2017)</ref>. Moreover, the association between hearing loss and cognitive decline in older adults has been shown to result in an overestimation of age-related declines in different cognitive domains, such as processing speed, working memory, and inhibitory control <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Guerreiro &amp; Van Gerven, 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Given the greater cognitive decline that is typically observed among older adults with hearing loss (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Loughrey et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Taljaard et al., 2015)</ref> -as well as the proposed role of reduced distinctiveness of neural representations on cognitive decline among older adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Li &amp; Rieckmann, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Li &amp; Sikström, 2002)</ref> -, the goal of the present study was to investigate the effect of age-related hearing loss on previously reported age differences in neural differentiation. To this end, we reanalyzed the data of two existing studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Guerreiro et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Rienäcker et al., 2022)</ref> to examine neural distinctiveness within visual and auditory regions in a group of younger adults, a group of older adults with normal hearing, and a group of older adults with age-related hearing loss. We hypothesized that older adults with age-related hearing loss -who typically experience greater cognitive decline (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Loughrey et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Taljaard et al., 2015)</ref> -would evince even greater reductions in neural distinctiveness relative to younger adults than those exhibited by older adults with normal hearing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Materials and Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>Participants were 40 younger adults (aged 20-29 years, M = 23.7, SD = 2.7, 30 women and 10 men) and 45 older adults (aged 60-83 years, M = 66.7, SD = 5.1, 18 women and 27 men), who had taken part in two research studies investigating age-related differences in the neural bases of selective attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Guerreiro et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Rienäcker et al., 2022)</ref> 1 . Three younger adults were excluded from data analysis because their functional localizer runs were prematurely aborted. In addition, one younger adult and three older adults were excluded due to excessive head motion (i.e., &gt; 3 mm/°).</p><p>The final sample therefore comprised 36 younger adults (aged 20-29 years, M = 23.7, SD = 2.8, 27 women and 9 men) and 42 older adults (aged 60-83 years, M = 66.6, SD = 5.1, 16 women and 26 men). All participants were right-handed and reported normal or corrected-to-normal vision. Furthermore, older participants were generally free of significant cognitive impairment, with a score of 18 or greater in the Dutch Cognitive Screening Test <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(De Graaf &amp; Deelman, 1991)</ref> or with a score of 22 or greater in the Montreal Cognitive Assessment <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Nasreddine et al., 2005)</ref> (for further details, see below).</p><p>In order to investigate the effect of age-related hearing loss on age differences in neural distinctiveness, the older sample was split into two groups based on their hearing sensitivity (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Guerreiro &amp; Van Gerven, 2017)</ref>, which was assessed by measuring pure-tone detection thresholds (in dB HL) in each ear at 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 kHz with a Voyager 522 audiometer 1 The data of these two studies were combined here because the same functional localizer task was used prior to the main experimental runs in each of these studies, in order to localize category-selective regions of interest (ROIs) in the visual and auditory cortex of each participant.</p><p>(Madsen Electronics, Taastrup, Denmark) in a sound-attenuated room.</p><p>Overall hearing sensitivity was expressed as the average hearing thresholds at 1, 2, and 4 kHz for the better ear, according to recommendations for the assessment of hearing loss <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Davis, 1995)</ref>. In keeping with the criterion used in other brain imaging studies investigating the effect of age-related hearing loss on brain organization -according to which hearing loss has been defined as a pure-tone average greater than 25 dB HL (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Campbell &amp; Sharma, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Lin et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Luan et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Mudar &amp; Husain, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr"></ref> see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Erb &amp; Obleser, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Peelle et al., 2011</ref>) -, we used a cutoff of 25 dB HL for splitting the older sample. This yielded a group of 21 older adults (aged 60-75 years, 9 women and 12 men) with clinically normal hearing (M = 17.0 dB HL, SD = 6.3) and a group of 21 older adults (aged 60-83 years, 7 women and 14 men) with mild-to-moderate hearing loss (M = 34.1 dB HL, SD = 5.7). Younger adults had clinically normal hearing (M = 7.5 dB HL, SD = 4.8). Importantly, Fisher's exact tests revealed no significant association between participant group and study [χ 2 (2) = 0.06, p = 1.000], such that the distribution of participants across the three groups did not differ between the two studies (i.e., ~50% of participants in each group originated from each study; see Supplementary Table <ref type="table">1</ref> and<ref type="table">Supplementary Table 2</ref>).</p><p>Older adults with poor hearing were significantly older (M = 68.3 years, SD = 5.3) than older adults with good hearing (M = 64.9 years, SD =  <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Deelman, 1991)</ref> in the first study (older adults with good hearing: M = 19.5, SD = 0.7; older adults with poor hearing: M = 19.4, SD = 0.8) and with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Nasreddine et al., 2005)</ref> in the second study (older adults with good hearing: M = 25.6, SD = 1.9; older adults with poor hearing: M = 25.7, SD = 2.2).</p><p>The two studies were approved by the local ethics committee of the Maastricht Brain Imaging Center and, in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, informed consent was obtained from each participant prior to testing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental Procedure</head><p>The functional localizer task was presented prior to the main experimental runs in each of the two studies using E-Prime (Psychology Software Tools, Pittsburgh, PA). Four categories of stimuli were used: faces, scenes, voices, and music (for details, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Guerreiro et al., 2015)</ref>. In short, visual stimuli consisted of grayscale images of male and female faces (i.e., face stimuli) and grayscale images of natural scenes (i.e., scene stimuli), whereas auditory stimuli consisted of trisyllabic, low-frequency Portuguese words (i.e., voice stimuli) and three-note melodies (i.e., music stimuli). In order to ensure that participants processed the voice stimuli phonologically (rather than semantically), only participants who had no knowledge of Portuguese were recruited. Voice stimuli were spoken by two female and two male native Portuguese speakers, whereas music stimuli were played by one of four musical instruments (i.e., flute, guitar, marimba, and piano).</p><p>Each stimulus category was presented in five 16-s blocks (during which 16 800-ms stimuli, each followed by a 200-ms inter-stimulus interval, were presented), interleaved with 16-s rest blocks 2 . The order of the blocks was counterbalanced across participants using a Latin square design.</p><p>Participants were asked to passively view and hear all stimuli.</p><p>Before testing, the intensity of the auditory stimuli was individually adjusted to comfort level. This was done by increasing or decreasing the intensity of the auditory stimuli until a hearing level was reached that was both audible and comfortable for each participant.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MRI Acquisition</head><p>Data from the first study <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Guerreiro et al., 2015)</ref> were acquired on a 3 T Siemens Allegra MR system (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany), equipped with a standard quadrature head coil, at the Maastricht Brain Imaging Center. Functional T2*-weighted images were acquired with an echo-planar imaging contrast. Anatomical T1-weighted images were acquired with a 2 In the second study <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Rienäcker et al., 2022)</ref>, each stimulus category was presented in five 18-s blocks, interleaved with 16-s rest blocks. Note that this timing difference should not affect the results because we use the β values derived from fitting a general linear model (GLM) to each participant's data. Nevertheless, we take eventual differences between the two studies into account by explicitly incorporating Study as a factor in the statistical analyses (see below). magnetization prepared rapid gradient echo (MP-RAGE) sequence (TR = 2250 ms; TE = 2.6 ms; FA = 9°; 192 sagittal slices; voxel dimensions = 1 × 1 × 1 mm 3 ; FOV = 256 × 256).</p><p>Data from the second study <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Rienäcker et al., 2022)</ref>  Visual stimuli were projected onto a rear-projection screen at the end of the scanner bore and viewed using a mirror attached to the head coil.</p><p>Auditory stimuli were presented using the S14 Insert Earphones for fMRI research (Sensimetrics Corporation, Malden, MA). Foam cushions and padding were used to stabilize head position.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MRI Preprocessing</head><p>Functional and anatomical data were preprocessed using using BrainVoyager 20.6 and analyzed using BrainVoyager 22.2 (BrainInnovation, Maastricht, the Netherlands). After excluding the first two volumes, functional data underwent default preprocessing, which included slice scan time correction, head motion correction, and removal of linear and nonlinear trends above 0.005 Hz. After preprocessing, functional data were coregistered to the anatomical volume and normalized to Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space, resulting in an interpolated functional voxel size of 3 × 3 × 3 mm. These MNI-normalized, functional images were spatially smoothed using a Gaussian kernel of 6 mm full-width at halfmaximum.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ROI Definition</head><p>In line with previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Chamberlain et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Lalwani et al., 2019)</ref>, we created participant-specific ROIs based on a combination of anatomical and functional criteria. First, we restricted analyses to anatomical regions deemed to be relevant for each sensory modality, after importing the Desikan-Killiany Atlas <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Desikan et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr"></ref> https://identifiers.org/neurovault.image:23262) to BrainVoyager. For auditory processing, the anatomical mask contained the bilateral superior temporal gyrus, bank of the superior temporal sulcus, transverse temporal gyrus, and supramarginal gyrus <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Lalwani et al., 2019)</ref>. For visual processing, the anatomical mask contained the bilateral fusiform gyrus and the bilateral parahippocampal gyrus <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Chamberlain et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>Subsequently, we created participant-specific functional ROIs within these anatomical masks based on cortical responses to each experimental condition, in order to ensure that only task-relevant voxels were analyzed (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Chamberlain et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Lalwani et al., 2019)</ref>. Cortical responses (i.e., β values) were estimated in each voxel using a GLM that included four predictors of interest, one for each stimulus category (voices, music, faces, scenes), convolved with a canonical, two-gamma hemodynamic response function. In addition, the six translation and rotation parameters obtained by rigid body head motion correction were z-transformed and included as confound predictors. Finally, rest blocks were implicitly modeled as baseline in the design. Contrasts were then specified for each experimental condition (relative to baseline) and used to create auditory and visual ROIs for each participant.</p><p>The auditory ROI was created by selecting the most responsive voxels to both auditory conditions in an alternating order (i.e., the most responsive voxel to voices, followed by the most responsive voxel to music, followed by the next most responsive voxel to voices, and so on). Conversely, the visual ROI was created by selecting the most responsive voxels to both visual conditions in an alternating order (i.e., the most responsive voxel to faces, followed by the most responsive voxel to scenes, followed by the next most responsive voxel to faces, and so on). If the next most responsive voxel to a given condition had already been added to the ROI, then the next most responsive voxel that had not yet been added to the ROI was included. This process was repeated in order to create ROIs of different sizes (i.e., 1000 voxels, 2000 voxels, 5000 voxels, 10000 voxels, and entire anatomical mask;</p><p>see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">1</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">2</ref>), so as to ensure that any observed effects would not depend on a specific ROI size (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Chamberlain et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Lalwani et al., 2019)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Neural Distinctiveness</head><p>In order to generate multiple cortical response patterns for pattern similarity analysis, we estimated cortical responses (i.e., β values) in each voxel using a GLM that included separate predictors of interest for each of the 20 task blocks (i.e., five voice blocks, five music blocks, five face blocks, and five scene blocks), convolved with a canonical, two-gamma hemodynamic response function. As before (see above), the six translation and rotation parameters obtained by rigid body head motion correction were z-transformed and included as confound predictors, and rest blocks were implicitly modeled as baseline in the design. Contrasts were then specified for each block of each relevant experimental condition (relative to baseline) in each ROI (see below) and used to generate cortical response patterns for each participant.</p><p>Neural distinctiveness was calculated by subtracting the similarity of cortical response patterns elicited by blocks of different experimental conditions (i.e., between-category similarity) from the similarity of cortical response patterns elicited by blocks of the same experimental condition (i.e., within-category similarity), separately by ROI and corresponding sensory modality (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Chamberlain et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Lalwani et al., 2019)</ref>. For example, during auditory processing, within-category similarity was computed in the auditory ROI as the average correlation (Fisher-transformed) in cortical response patterns between all pairs of blocks from the same auditory condition (i.e., all voice-voice pairs and all music-music pairs), whereas between-category similarity was computed as the average correlation (Fisher-transformed) in cortical response patterns between all pairs of blocks from different auditory conditions (i.e., all voice-music pairs).</p><p>Conversely, during visual processing, within-category similarity was computed in the visual ROI as the average correlation <ref type="bibr">(Fisher-transformed)</ref> in cortical response patterns between all pairs of blocks from the same visual condition (i.e., all face-face pairs and all scene-scene pairs), whereas between category-similarity was computed as the average correlation 1000 voxels, 2000 voxels, 5000 voxels, 10000 voxels, entire anatomical mask) as a within-group factor. In these and all subsequent analyses, a Greenhouse-Geisser correction was applied to the degrees of freedom and significance levels whenever the assumption of sphericity was violated.</p><p>Planned comparisons (i.e., oneway ANOVAs) were performed separately by ROI size, in order to examine the effect of group at each level of ROI size (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Chamberlain et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Lalwani et al., 2019)</ref>. In these and all subsequent analyses, Welch's F was reported whenever the assumption of homogeneity of variances was violated. In the event of significant group effects, post-hoc comparisons were performed using the Games-Howell test, given its robustness when group sizes are unequal and when population variances are different. The latter analyses (i.e., oneway ANOVAs and corresponding post-hoc comparisons) were also performed as Bayesian hypothesis tests using standard priors in JASP 0.17 <ref type="bibr">(JASP Team, 2023)</ref> and Bayes Factors (BF 10 ) are reported to indicate the evidential value for the alternative vs. null hypothesis.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Given the proposed role of neural distinctiveness on age-related differences in cognitive performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Li &amp; Rieckmann, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Li &amp; Sikström, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Li et al., 2001)</ref>, as well as the increasingly recognized association between age-related hearing loss and cognitive decline (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Loughrey et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Taljaard et al., 2015)</ref>, the goal of the present study was to investigate the impact of age-related hearing loss on previously reported age differences in neural differentiation. To do so, we compared neural distinctiveness within the visual and auditory cortices between older adults with mild-to-moderate hearing loss, older adults with clinically normal hearing, and a control group of younger adults.</p><p>We had hypothesized that older adults with age-related hearing losswho typically experience greater cognitive decline than older adults with normal hearing (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Loughrey et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Taljaard et al., 2015)</ref> -would exhibit greater reductions in neural distinctiveness relative to younger adults than those exhibited by older adults with normal hearing. Our results are partially consistent with this hypothesis. Indeed, we found evidence for neural dedifferentiation in the auditory cortex only when comparing older adults with poor hearing with younger adults, and not when comparing older adults with good hearing with younger adults. Note that had we disregarded age-related hearing loss and compared all older adults with the younger group, then we would have concluded -as have previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Lalwani et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Simmonite &amp; Polk, 2022)</ref> -that older adults show reduced neural distinctiveness in the auditory cortex relative to younger adults (see Supplementary Results). Importantly, because in the present study older adults with poor hearing were also significantly older than older adults with good hearing (see Methods), the present findings could still arguably be accounted for by a true aging effect (which is only detected in an older group of older adults). In order to rule out this possibility, we repeated our analyses after matching older participants with good hearing and older participants with poor hearing based on their age (see</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Supplementary Results</head><p>). These additional analyses, on a smaller subset of participants, entirely replicated the present findings. That is, older adults with poor hearing -despite their now lower age range -had reduced neural distinctiveness in the auditory cortex relative to younger adults, whereas differences between older adults with good hearing and younger adults did not reach significance. Taken together, these results indicate that agerelated dedifferentiation in the auditory cortex <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Lalwani et al., 2019</ref>; see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Simmonite &amp; Polk, 2022)</ref> is exacerbated by age-related hearing loss. This effect may be related to a greater decrease in auditory GABA levels among older adults with age-related hearing loss (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Gao et al., 2015</ref>; see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Dobri &amp; Ross, 2021</ref>; but see <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Profant et al., 2013)</ref>, as lower GABA levels have been shown to be associated with reduced neural distinctiveness in the corresponding sensory cortices <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Chamberlain et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Lalwani et al., 2019)</ref>.</p><p>Neural distinctiveness in the visual cortex, on the other hand, was not only significantly reduced in older adults with poor hearing relative to younger adults, but also -and even more consistently so -in older adults with good hearing relative to younger adults. This pattern of results indicates that neural dedifferentiation in the visual cortex is not exacerbated by age-related hearing loss, and is therefore not in line with our hypothesis.</p><p>In fact, we had hypothesized that older adults with poor hearing -among whom greater age-related cognitive decline has been reported <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Guerreiro &amp; Van Gerven, 2017)</ref> -would exhibit even greater reductions in neural distinctiveness relative to younger adults than those exhibited by older adults with good hearing, an effect that should be especially noted in the ventral visual cortex, as neural dedifferentiation in this region in particular has been shown to be associated with greater cognitive decline among other adults (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Koen et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">J. Park et al., 2010)</ref>. The present results would therefore seem to suggest that the greater cognitive decline that is typically observed among older adults with age-related hearing loss as compared to older adults with normal hearing abilities (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Loughrey et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Taljaard et al., 2015)</ref> cannot be explained by greater neural dedifferentiation in this group. However, global cognitive function did not significantly differ between the present group of older adults with good hearing and the present group of older adults with poor hearing (see Methods), so this possibility cannot be definitely ruled out here.</p><p>Importantly, the lack of significant differences in global cognitive function between older adults with good hearing and older adults with poor hearing in the present study is not surprising for two reasons: first, differences in global cognitive function between older adults with poor hearing and older adults with good hearing have been shown to have a small effect size (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Loughrey et al., 2018)</ref>, so they are more likely to be detected in studies using very large samples (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Rutherford et al., 2018)</ref>; second, in each of the two original studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Guerreiro et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Rienäcker et al., 2022)</ref> we had strived to recruit healthy, community-dwelling older adults with no evidence of significant cognitive impairment. Finally -and worth noting -, we found very little evidence for a relationship between neural distinctiveness and cognitive function in the present study (see Supplementary Results), which is likely due to differences in measures of cognitive function across studies (cf. J. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Park et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Koen et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Srokova et al., 2020)</ref>. In contrast to the present study, in which a very limited range of cognitive tests were used (see Supplementary Table <ref type="table">1</ref> and Supplementary Table <ref type="table">2</ref>), previous studies that were explicitly aimed at investigating the relationship between neural selectivity and cognitive function have typically included a much more comprehensive and finegrained assessment of cognitive function (see <ref type="bibr">Koen et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">J. Park et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Srokova et al., 2020)</ref>. The group differences in neural distinctiveness reported in the present study are unlikely to be due to differences in univariate activity across groups (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Chamberlain et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Lalwani et al., 2019)</ref>. Indeed, we observed that both groups of older adults showed reduced neural distinctiveness in the visual cortex relative to younger adults, yet there were no significant group differences in univariate visual cortical responses during visual processing. Furthermore, we observed that older adults with poor hearing showed significantly reduced neural distinctiveness in the auditory cortex relative to younger adults, yet there were no significant group differences in univariate auditory cortical responses during auditory processing. Finally, a set of additional analyses in which mean univariate activity was included as a covariate (not reported) entirely replicated the group differences in neural distinctiveness reported above, further corroborating the notion that group differences in neural distinctiveness are unlikely to be explained by differences in univariate activity across groups.</p><p>Group differences in neural distinctiveness -especially those in the visual cortex -are also unlikely to be explained by differences in visual acuity across groups. First, participants in the present study did report normal or corrected-to-normal vision -although, admittedly, there were significant group differences in visual acuity (see also e.g. <ref type="bibr">Koen et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Zebrowitz et al., 2016)</ref>, such that both older adults with good hearing and older adults with poor hearing had significantly lower visual acuity than younger adults (see Supplementary Table <ref type="table">1</ref> and Supplementary Table <ref type="table">2</ref>). Importantly, partial correlations across the entire sample, while controlling for chronological age, yielded no evidence for an association between neural distinctiveness in the visual cortex and measures of visual acuity in study 1 [1000 voxels: r p = -.14, p = .427; 2000 voxels: r p = -.11, p = .514; 5000 voxels: r p = -.10, p = .574; 10000 voxels: r p = -.03, p = .851; anatomical mask: r p = -.01, p = .978] or study 2 [1000 voxels: r p = -.11, p = .503; 2000 voxels: r p = -.13, p = .421; 5000 voxels: r p = -.13, p = .434; 10000 voxels: r p = -.17, p = .299; anatomical mask: r p = -.18, p = .263]. Second, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Chamberlain et al. (2021)</ref> found evidence for age-related dedifferentiation in the visual cortex in older adults relative to younger adults even after controlling for visual acuity. Finally, visual acuity failed to mediate the relationship between age and measures of neural dedifferentiation in a study that employed mediation analyses to explicitly examine possible mediators of age-related dedifferentiation in the visual cortex <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Zebrowitz et al., 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Current evidence suggests that age differences in neural distinctiveness are due to both an age-related increase in the similarity of cortical response patterns elicited by different stimulus categories (i.e., between-category similarity) and an age-related decrease in the reliability of cortical response patterns elicited by identical stimulus categories (i.e., within-category similarity) <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Simmonite &amp; Polk, 2022</ref>; see also <ref type="bibr">Carp, Park, Polk, et al., 2011)</ref>. We therefore further explored the effect of age-related hearing loss on age differences in both of these mechanisms (see</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Supplementary Results</head><p>). Across visual and auditory cortices, we found that differences in neural distinctiveness across groups were due to group differences in the reliability of cortical response patterns elicited by identical stimulus categories, rather than by group differences in the similarity of cortical response patterns elicited by different stimulus categories (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Chamberlain et al., 2021</ref>, for similar results in the visual cortex; and Simmonite &amp; Polk, 2022, for similar results in the auditory cortex). Specifically, both older adults with good hearing and older adults with poor hearing exhibited lower within-category similarity values in the visual cortex relative to younger adults, whereas between-category similarity values in the visual cortex did not significantly differ across groups. Furthermore, within-category similarity values in the auditory cortex tended to be lower in older adults with poor hearing relative to younger adults, but not significantly different between older adults with good hearing and younger adults, whereas between-category similarity values in the auditory cortex did not significantly differ across groups. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Simmonite and Polk (2022)</ref> have also recently provided evidence for a relationship between neural distinctiveness in different cortical regions, particularly in older adults. In the present study, we likewise found some evidence for a relationship between neural distinctiveness in the visual and auditory cortices, but only when this relationship was examined across the entire sample (see Supplementary Results). Moreover, as <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Simmonite and Polk (2022)</ref>, we also found evidence for a relationship between withincategory similarity values in the visual and auditory cortices, not only when this relationship was examined across the entire sample but also when it was examined separately in each group. Finally, although there was no evidence for a relationship between between-category similarity values in the visual and auditory cortices in the study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Simmonite and Polk (2022)</ref>, evidence for such a relationship emerged in the present study in the group of older adults with poor hearing.</p><p>In conclusion, the results of the present study suggest that age-related hearing loss does not modulate age differences in neural distinctiveness within the ventral visual cortex. In contrast, when the effects of age-related hearing loss are minimized -by comparing younger adults and older adults with clinically normal hearing -, age differences in neural distinctiveness within the auditory cortex can no longer be reliably observed. These results demonstrate that hearing loss exacerbates age-related dedifferentiation in the auditory cortex, likely due to a greater reduction in auditory GABA levels among older adults with hearing loss <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Gao et al., 2015)</ref>.  Probability values range from 0 to 1, whereby 0 indicates no participant at a given voxel and 1 indicates that all participants share that voxel.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>4.2) [t(40) = 2.31, p = .026, d = 0.71].

A positive neural distinctiveness value indicates that cortical response patterns are more similar when elicited by the same stimulus category than when elicited by different stimulus categories, whereas a negative neural distinctiveness value would indicate that cortical response patterns are more similar when elicited by different stimulus categories than when elicited by the same stimulus category. Neural distinctiveness values in each ROI were then submitted to a repeated measures ANOVA in IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows 28.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, N. Y., USA), with group (3 levels: younger adults, older adults with good hearing, older adults with poor hearing) and study (2 levels: study 1, study 2) as between-group factors and ROI size (5 levels:</figDesc></figure>
