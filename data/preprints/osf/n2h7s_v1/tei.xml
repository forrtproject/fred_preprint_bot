<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Background. Symptom reduction occurring early in depression treatment is associated with favourable post-treatment outcome, but it is not known how early reduction in specific depression symptoms affect treatment outcome. We aimed to determine the impact of symptom-specific change from pre-treatment to week four during internet-delivered CBT (ICBT) on overall and symptom-specific depression severity at post-treatment. We hypothesized that change in mood and emotional involvement would be most strongly associated with later overall depression severity.</p><p>Methods. 1300 participants with Major Depressive Disorder were followed over 12 weeks of ICBT using the self-report Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale gauging nine symptoms. Linear models, informed by causal inference and cross-lagged network analysis methods, were used to estimate associations between early symptom-specific change and post-treatment depression severity, controlling for register-based and self-reported pre-treatment confounders.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results.</head><p>Early reduction in all symptoms was associated with lower overall and symptom-specific depression severity post-ICBT. Seven symptoms showed similar associations between early change and overall depression severity post-treatment: mood (standardized beta [β]=0.44), feelings of unease (β=0.39), ability to concentrate (β=0.46), initiative (β=0.43), emotional involvement (β=0.42), pessimism (β=0.44), and zest for life (β=0.42). Change in sleep (β=0.27) and appetite (β=0.27) had weaker associations with overall depression severity at post-treatment and were the only symptoms showing the hypothesized difference compared with mood and emotional involvement.</p><p>Conclusions. The impact of early symptom-specific reduction on post-treatment depression severity in ICBT for MDD may be similar across most symptoms, but less for the sleep and appetite symptoms, although causal interpretations rests on several assumptions.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Symptom reduction during the first few weeks of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) treatment is associated with higher rates of remission and lower symptom burden post-treatment across psychological and medical therapies <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Beard &amp; Delgadillo, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Solmi et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Szegedi et al., 2009)</ref>. This includes internet-delivered cognitive behavioural therapy (ICBT), where reduced symptoms during the first 4-6 weeks is predictive of a better post-treatment outcome <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Forsell et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Schibbye et al., 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Depression, however, is a heterogeneous disorder with numerous possible symptom combinations <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Fried &amp; Nesse, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Maj et al., 2020)</ref>. Overall improvement during treatment is therefore not necessarily equally distributed across specific symptoms <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Garke et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Kopta et al., 1994)</ref>. It is not known whether early improvement in some specific depression symptoms is more important for treatment outcome than improvement in others. Identifying specific influential symptoms could indicate specific symptoms to target in treatment. Such guidance is highly needed, given that knowledge on key components of psychological treatments for depression is very limited <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Cuijpers et al., 2019)</ref>.</p><p>Shifting the focus from overall depression scores to individual symptoms is in line with the network theory of mental disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Borsboom, 2017)</ref>. This theory propose that mental disorders are the result bi-directional causal influences between symptoms. Change in a specific symptom is assumed to influence other symptoms in the network, leading to effects that spread through the symptom network and affect overall symptom severity. Accordingly, a central task of network analysis is to identify the most influential symptoms in the network, which could inform treatment design as effectively targeting influential symptoms could have widespread effects across the symptom network <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Borsboom &amp; Cramer, 2013)</ref>. The influence of different symptoms in a network is usually quantified through estimating centrality, indicating how strongly a specific symptom is correlated with other symptoms in the network. Mood and emotional involvement are considered hallmark symptoms of depression in DSM-5 <ref type="bibr">(American Psychiatric Association, 2013)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">n.d.)</ref>, and have been identified as the most central symptoms of depression in cross-sectional network analyses, along with energy loss and concentration problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Wichers et al., 2021)</ref>. Mood and anhedonia were also the two depression symptoms most strongly associated with MDD onset over a six-year follow-up in a population of adults without a prior history of depression <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Boschloo et al., 2016)</ref>.</p><p>A limitation of much prior network theory research is that, although the theory concerns causal interactions between symptoms, it has predominantly been evaluated using cross-sectional designs that provide weak evidence of causality <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(McNally, 2021)</ref>. Longitudinal data provide the opportunity for stronger causal inference, making it possible to disentangle temporal relationships between symptoms by adjusting for prior symptom levels and potential confounders <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(VanderWeele et al., 2016)</ref>. Here we combined modern epidemiological methods for causal inference <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(VanderWeele, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">VanderWeele et al., 2016)</ref> with the recently proposed cross-lagged network model <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Wysocki et al., 2022)</ref>.</p><p>We aimed to determine the impact of early change in specific depression symptoms during the first four weeks of ICBT on overall depression severity at post-treatment. Further, we aimed to explore the impact of early change in each depression symptom on symptom-specific levels at post-treatment (i.e. a crosslagged network analysis). We hypothesized that early change in the two hallmark symptoms of depression -mood and emotional involvement (anhedonia) -would be more strongly associated with overall depression severity at post-treatment than change in other symptoms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Design and participants</head><p>This study leveraged the new MULTI-PSYCH cohort <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Boberg et al., 2023)</ref>, containing multi-modal data (clinical, registry and genetic) for adults treated with ICBT at the Internet Psychiatry Unit in Stockholm. Participants were recruited from 2009 through 2019. We included the 1,300 participants who were diagnosed with mild-to-moderate MDD and enrolled in a 12-week ICBT intervention for MDD <ref type="bibr">(Hedman et al., 2014)</ref>. Self-rated depression symptoms were collected weekly via an online treatment platform and the present analyses used data from pre-treatment, week four of treatment, and post-treatment (week 12). Additional data were taken from several linked Swedish administrative registers including the National Patient Register, the Prescribed Drug Register and the Longitudinal integrated database for health insurance and labour market studies. Detailed information on the MULTI-PSYCH cohort, and the ICBT treatment for MDD, is available elsewhere <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Boberg et al., 2023)</ref>. This study was approved by the Regional Ethics Board in Stockholm and the National Ethical Review Authority (approval numbers 2009/1089-31/2, 2022-00602-02) and all participants provided informed consent before entering the study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures</head><p>The self-reported Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS-S) <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Svanborg &amp; Åsberg, 1994)</ref> was used to measure both specific depression symptoms and overall depression severity. MADRS-S comprises nine items rated on a 0-6 response scale, with higher numbers indicating more severe symptoms. MADRS-S includes items capturing the following symptoms within a three-day recall period: 1) mood, 2) feelings of unease, 3) (reduced) sleep, 4) (reduced) appetite, 5) ability to concentrate, 6) initiative, 7) emotional involvement (anhedonia), 8) pessimism and 9) zest for life. Item responses are summed for a total score of 0-54, which was used as our overall depression severity measure, while items specific ratings were used as measures of specific symptoms. The MADRS-S has shown adequate psychometric properties for measuring depression when conceptualised as a latent construct <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(van Ballegooijen et al., 2016)</ref>. Cronbach's alpha in the current sample was 0.78 at pre-treatment, 0.88 at week four and 0.92 at post-treatment.</p><p>The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Kroenke et al., 2001)</ref> was used as an alternative self-rated measure of overall depression severity in sensitivity analyses. PHQ-9 comprises nine items rated from 0 (Not at all) to 3 (Nearly every day), intended to correspond to the DSM criteria for MDD. The items are summed for a total score of 0-27. Cronbach's alpha of PHQ-9 at post-treatment was 0.87 in the current sample.</p><p>Covariates. We adjusted for the following pre-treatment covariates to reduce confounding: depression symptoms (each specific items of MADRS-S), sex (male/female), age (years), highest attained education level (primary/secondary/higher), disposable income in the year prior treatment (categorized into quintiles), civil status (married/unmarried/separated), self-reported prior diagnosis of MDD (no/mild/moderate or severe), prescription of anti-depressant medication in the year before treatment (yes/no), self-reported prior psychiatric in-patient care (yes/no), self-reported prior suicide attempt (yes/no), self-reported alcohol risk score, version of ICBT protocol, self-reported insomnia score, psychiatric comorbidity in the year prior to treatment (yes/no), days of full or partial paid sick leave in the year prior to treatment (≤ 14/&gt;14), primary employment status in the year prior to treatment (employed/unemployed). Covariates were collected from self-reports and from linked Swedish administrative registers. Detailed definitions and sources of the covariates are provided in Supplementary table 1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical analyses</head><p>Descriptive statistics for the sample are presented as mean (SD) or count (%), as appropriate (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). The individual symptom scores, as well as the total MADRS-S score were standardized (mean=0, SD=1) before analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Change in specific depression symptoms and overall depression severity at post-treatment</head><p>The association between change in each of the depression symptoms from pre-treatment to week four and overall depression severity at post-treatment was estimated by regressing the MADRS-S sum score at post-treatment on each of the individual depression symptoms at week four. We built separate linear regression models for each symptom at week four with adjustment for all specific pre-treatment symptoms along with the other pre-treatment covariates (nine models in total). Formal model definitions are provided in the Supplementary Methods. Multi-collinearity among the symptoms was checked using the variance inflation factor that was &lt;2 in all complete case models. Estimates are presented as standardized betas along with 95% confidence intervals in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>.</p><p>By controlling for pre-treatment symptom levels, the coefficient for each specific symptom at week four can be interpreted as the association between a change in that specific symptom from pre-treatment to week four and MADRS-S score at post-treatment, adjusted for all other symptoms at pre-treatment (for details, see Supplementary Methods 1 and the eMethods2 in <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Nakamura et al. (2022)</ref>). Controlling for each specific symptom at pre-treatment provides stronger adjustment for potential confounding and reverse causality <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(VanderWeele et al., 2016)</ref>, and has been proposed as a method to estimate the effects of separate items of a scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(VanderWeele, 2022)</ref>. Change in the other symptoms were not adjusted for (i.e. only the symptom of interest at week four was included in the model), as these were assumed to be on the causal path from change in a specific symptom and post-treatment depression severity. The modelling approach was guided by the assumed causal structure depicted in the directed acyclic graph in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> (see Supplemental Methods 2 for an elaboration). symptom 1 and 2 are shown to avoid clutter, but the same structure is assumed for all the nine symptoms. C denotes the set of pre-treatment covariates.</p><p>We hypothesized that early change in the each of the two hallmark symptoms of depression, mood and emotional engagement, would be more strongly associated with overall depression severity at posttreatment than early change in the other symptoms. This was tested by comparing the coefficients for the mood and emotional involvement symptoms against the coefficients for the seven other symptoms using two-sided z-tests at α = 0.05 <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Paternoster et al., 1998)</ref>  <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">(Table 2)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cross-lagged network analysis</head><p>Similar models were used to estimate associations between symptom-specific change and posttreatment levels of specific symptoms. We fit separate models for each symptom (week four) -symptom (post-treatment) combination, yielding 81 models that where were controlled for all pre-treatment symptoms as well as the set of other pre-treatment covariates. A formal definition of these models is provided in the Supplementary Methods 1. The modelling approach was inspired by the Cross-Lagged Network Model proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Wysocki et al. (2022)</ref> but was modified to control for prior symptom levels, for reasons described above. Estimated associations are presented as standardized betas with 95% confidence intervals in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> and visualised as a network in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Expected influence</head><p>The one-step expected influence (EI) of each symptom was calculated as the sum of all edges going out of a symptom (including the auto-regressive association that a symptom has with itself at a later timepoint) and are presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>. This is a modification of the cross-sectional EI that sums all edges connected to a node, but excludes the auto-correlation which is always 1 in cross-sectional analyses <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Robinaugh et al., 2016)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Missing data</head><p>Missing data was handled by using multiple imputation by chained equations to create 20 imputed datasets. Analyses was performed on each of the 20 imputed dataset and estimates were pooled using Rubin's rules. More information on the multiple imputation procedure is provided in Supplementary Methods 3, with imputation diagnostics presented in Supplementary Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> and <ref type="figure">3</ref>. We also conducted complete case analyses restricted to participants having MADRS-S data at pre-treatment, week four and post-treatment, adjusted only for pre-treatment symptom levels (Supplementary Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sensitivity analyses</head><p>We conducted several sensitivity analyses. First, we performed a sensitivity analysis using the PHQ-9 sum score at post-treatment as the outcome (instead of MADRS-S) to assess the sensitivity of our estimates to the depression measure used (Supplementary Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>).</p><p>Second, we performed sensitivity analyses with MADRS-S sum scores excluding the predictor symptom as outcome (e.g. by regressing the sum of symptom 2-9 at post-treatment on symptom 1 at week four) to assess the extent to which auto-regressive effects could explain associations (Supplementary Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>).</p><p>Third, potential effect modification by initial depression severity was assessed by stratifying the sample by the median of MADRS-S severity at pre-treatment and performing analyses in each of the strata separately (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">4</ref>).</p><p>Fourth, to partially account for instability in the individual item measurements, we performed sensitivity analyses using individual regression slopes of the weekly measures of each symptom from pretreatment to week four as predictor variables. Slopes were obtained by regressing weekly values of each symptom from pre-treatment to week four on time for each participant individually (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">5</ref>).</p><p>Finally, to investigate whether differences in connection strength could be explained by differences in mean or variance of the symptoms <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Lee et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Terluin et al., 2016)</ref> we plotted the association of each symptom at week four and depression severity at post-treatment (standardized betas) against their mean and SD at week four (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>).</p><p>A pre-registration of this analytic plan and the R code used is available at: <ref type="url" target="https://osf.io/7ga8k/">https://osf.io/7ga8k/</ref>. The only changes in relation to the pre-registration were slight redefinitions of the covariates psychiatric comorbidity, prior MDD episodes and disposable income (Supplementary Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). All analyses were performed in R version 4.3.2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>We included 1300 individuals diagnosed with MDD who were followed over a 12-week ICBT treatment for depression. The mean age was 37.6 years (SD 11.9), 66% were female and 42% has been prescribed antidepressant medication in the year prior to treatment (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). The mean MADRS-S score was 22.7 (SD 6.3) at pre-treatment, 17.1 (7.5) at week four, and 13.0 (SD 8.1) at post-treatment. The median duration between pre-treatment and week four was 28 days (interquartile range = 2). Symptom-specific mean (SD) levels at week four were: mood 1.78 (1.15), feelings of unease 2.41 (1.20), sleep 1.95 (1.33), appetite 0.89 (1.07), ability to concentrate 2.05 (1.17), initiative 2.11 (1.19), emotional involvement 1.85 (1.00), pessimism 2.57 (1.35), zest for life 1.52 (0.98). Data on the MADRS-S was missing for 14 (1%) participants at pre-treatment, 227 (17%) at week four and 248 (19%) at post-treatment. Missingness for the covariates is presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. </p></div>

Most of these associations were of similar strength with standardized betas between 0.39 and 0.46 (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>). The two exceptions were the change in sleep problems and decreased appetite, which showed weaker associations with overall depression severity at post-treatment: both with a standardized betas of 0.27 (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>). We hypothesised that change in the two hallmark symptoms of depression, mood and emotional engagement, would be more strongly associated with overall depression severity at post-treatment, compared to change in other symptoms. This was the case in relation to sleep and appetite that showed significantly weaker associations to posttreatment depression severity compared with both mood and emotional engagement. It was however not the case in relation to the other symptoms: feelings of unease, ability to concentrate, initiative pessimism or zest for life, whose associations to post-treatment depression severity were not significantly different from either mood or emotional involvement (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>). Complete case analyses with 942 participants gave similar results, with standardized betas within 0.02 from the main analysis (Supplementary Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>).</p></div>

Standardized betas of auto-regressive associations ranged 0.40-0.52. For the crosssymptom associations, most standardized betas were around 0.30-0.40, except for those associations including the sleep or appetite symptoms. Early change in sleep and appetite was associated with other individual symptoms at post-treatment with standardized betas ranging 0.16-0.24. Similarly, change in the other seven symptoms were associated with sleep and appetite at post-treatment with standardized betas of 0.15-0.30. (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>This study aimed to determine the impact of symptom-specific change during the first four weeks of internet-delivered psychotherapy on post-treatment depression severity in a large sample of adults treated for major depressive disorder. Early reduction in each of the nine depression symptoms was associated with lower overall depression severity at post-treatment. Contrary to our hypothesis, the strength of associations of most symptoms was not significantly different from those of mood or emotional involvement. The two exceptions were early reduction in sleep and the appetite, whose associations with overall depression severity at post-treatment were significantly weaker than those of mood and emotional involvement. Instead, for seven of the nine symptoms, associations were of similar magnitude with standardized betas around 0.4 (mood, feelings of unease, ability to concentrate, initiative, emotional involvement, pessimism, and zest for life), while sleep and appetite had standardized betas of 0.27. Translated into raw MADRS-S points, each one-step reduction in a specific symptom until week four was associated with roughly three points lower MADRS-S score at posttreatment for seven of the symptoms, while for sleep and appetite each one-step was associated with roughly two points lower MADRS-S score at post-treatment. Results were similar in the cross-lagged network analysis, where early change in most symptoms showed similar associations with symptomspecific severity at post-treatment. Again, the two exceptions were sleep and appetite, for which early change were less associated with level of other symptoms at post-treatment. These results are in line with prior network analyses findings that symptoms of sleep and appetite are relatively weakly related to other depression symptoms <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Boschloo et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Fried et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Hakulinen et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>If taken as causal estimates, our results indicate that -except for sleep and appetite -early reductions in most specific depression symptoms have similar effects on later depression levels. Interpreting any of these associations as causal effects rests on several formal assumptions that are discussed below. Informally, it seems plausible that change in one symptom could have effects on other symptoms at later time-points. Theories guiding psychological treatments frequently assume causal interactions between symptoms, although details of these relationships are often vaguely described <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Haslbeck et al., 2022)</ref>. For example, that reducing pessimistic thinking could lead to improved mood, as proposed in Beck's cognitive model of depression <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Wright &amp; Beck, 1983)</ref> or that increased initiative could lead to improved mood and emotional involvement by positive reinforcement, as proposed in the behavioural activation model of depression <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Jacobson et al., 2001)</ref>. From a treatment perspective, our results, with its similar associations across symptoms, suggests limited benefits of targeting any specific depression symptom over another early in treatment, at least at the group level. On a conceptual level, our results dovetails meta-analytic evidence that different psychological treatments, targeting different mechanisms and symptoms, have similar effects on depression <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Cuijpers et al., 2021)</ref> with limited evidence for the effects of specific treatment components <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Cuijpers et al., 2019)</ref>. Importantly, our results, as well as those of most treatment studies, are averaged at the group level, and for individual patients there may well be benefits of targeting some specific symptoms over others. It has been suggested that the heterogeneity of the depression diagnosis may in part explain the failure to single out specific mechanisms of change at the group level <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Maj et al., 2020)</ref>. It is therefore possible that the similarity of estimates across most of the symptoms examined could in part be explained by diagnostic heterogeneity, and that more refined characterizations of patients may be needed to clearly differentiate out influential symptoms (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Bringmann, 2024)</ref>.</p><p>Sleep and appetite deviated from the above-described pattern. It should be noted that these symptoms were also not targeted early in the ICBT-treatment which could potentially have influenced the results (appetite was not targeted in the ICBT program at all, and sleep problems were covered in the eight module). Decreased appetite was the symptom for which early change were least associated with subsequent depression. This was also the symptom that was least endorsed at pre-treatment, as measured by its mean value. Together, these findings suggest that appetite problems may be a relatively marginal problem in those seeking help trough ICBT, compared to other depression symptoms, and that improved appetite may not impact overall depression symptomatology to any large extent. Sensitivity analyses showed stronger associations between early change in appetite symptom and later depression among individuals with worse initial depression (although individuals with severe MDD were not included in the cohort). This could suggest that appetite is of greater importance when the depression level is higher, but may also reflect a greater variance in appetite in the high depression groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Lee et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Terluin et al., 2016)</ref>. Our results also suggest that improvements in sleep may be of less importance in relation to overall depression severity, versus improvements in the majority of other specific symptoms of depression. This is somewhat at odds with prior research, where targeting sleep problems using ICBT for insomnia has shown promising results in reducing depression among individuals with depression and comorbid insomnia even after three years <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Blom et al., 2015</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Blom et al., , 2017))</ref>. However, another study with this comorbid patient group indicates that combining ICBT for depression with ICBT for insomnia did not improve depression more than ICBT for depression plus insomnia placebo <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Blom et al., 2024)</ref> Disturbed sleep is arguably one of the least characteristic symptoms of depression, as it is frequently present across many different mental disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Baglioni et al., 2016)</ref>. It is possible that sleep may be of high importance in subpopulations of depressed patients, such as those with comorbid insomnia, but less influential than more specific depression symptoms in the general depressed population.</p><p>It should be noted that the similar associations across symptoms are also compatible with a latent construct view on depression. From this perspective symptoms are seen as interchangeable indicators of an underlying depressive condition, rather than causally efficacious treatment targets themselves (as in the network theory). When symptoms are assumed to be indicators of a latent construct, their associations to an outcome are expected to be proportional to their reliability as measures of the latent construct (e.g. their factor loadings) <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(VanderWeele, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">VanderWeele &amp; Vansteelandt, 2022)</ref>. Sleep and appetite symptoms have been found to be less reliable indicators of depression in some factor analytic studies of the MADRS-S <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Ntini et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Quilty et al., 2013)</ref>, which could explain their weaker associations to later overall depression severity in our analyses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Strengths and limitations</head><p>There are several strengths of this study. First, unlike most other network studies on interactions between specific depression symptoms (McNally, 2021), we used a longitudinal design allowing for stronger evidence of causality. This allowed for control for prior symptom levels along with a variety of other potentially confounding variables which strengthens the plausibility of the no residual and unmeasured confounding assumption required for causal interpretations of estimates (see Supplemental Methods 3 for an elaboration), although this assumption can never be proven with observational data. Second, although there was some loss to follow-up, the use of multiple imputation to handle missing data lessens the risk for selection bias. Third, causal interpretation also relies on the consistency assumption <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(VanderWeele, 2022)</ref>, that is, that the exposures (i.e. symptoms) are sufficiently well-defined such that there are no multiple versions of the same symptom that have different effects on later depression. Symptoms may hold different meanings, for instance the mood symptom may reflect different kinds of depressed mood, but our focus on individual symptoms of depression increases the granularity and specificity of our results. Fourth, we conducted several sensitivity analyses showing that associations be explained solely by autoregressive effects, the choice of depression scale or the way that change was modelled. It has been suggested that differences in connection strength can be explained by differences in the variance of the included variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Lee et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Terluin et al., 2016)</ref>. This explanation seems implausible in the present study, given that two symptoms (emotional involvement and zest for life) had lower variance than appetite and sleep was the symptom with the second highest variance at week four (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>).</p><p>The study also has limitations. First, the time-scale for measuring symptom change may not be optimal. Change was measured during the first four weeks, a decision based on prior research showing that this is a suitable time-window to predict post-treatment outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Forsell et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Schibbye et al., 2014)</ref>. It is possible, however, that more fine-grained time-scales (i.e. weeks, days, or hours) may be needed to accurately capture interactions between symptoms. Symptoms interacting on shorter timescales may have acted as time-varying confounders (and mediators) in our analyses leading to overlap and diluted differences between our estimates, analogous to when multiple interacting mediators are analysed in separate models <ref type="bibr">(cf. VanderWeele, 2015)</ref>. Second, no individuals with severe MDD were included in the cohort, which is of importance as our sensitivity analyses showed stronger associations among individuals with higher initial depression. It is therefore possible that our results do not generalize to patients with more severe depression. Third, the use of single items to measure symptoms increases the risk of measurement error affecting the results, which is a limitation shared with much of the current psychological network research <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(de Ron et al., 2022)</ref>. However, sensitivity analyses showed that similar results were obtained when we used repeated symptom-measures as predictors in the form of individual regression slopes, that should be more robust to random measurement error.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>We found that early reduction in all nine depression symptoms measured by the MADRS-S were associated with lower depression severity at post-treatment, both at the overall and at the symptomspecific levels. Contrary to our hypothesis, early change in the hallmark depression symptoms (mood and emotional involvement) did not stand out as more strongly associated with post-treatment depression severity compared with most other symptoms. Instead, associations were of similar magnitude for seven of the symptoms, with only sleep and appetite showing weaker associations with depression severity at post-treatment. Interpreting our results as causal effects rests on several assumptions, but our findings suggest that the impact of early reduction in specific symptoms on depression severity at post-treatment in ICBT for MDD may be similar across most symptoms, but less for the sleep and appetite symptoms.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
