<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Goal-directed attention allows us to purposefully engage with and act upon our environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Driver, 2001)</ref>. Stimulus driven attention permits important flexibility to perceive and engage with salient stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Corbetta et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Theeuwes, 2010)</ref>. Shifting visual spatial attention is generally associated with dorsoparietal regions <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Corbetta &amp; Shulman, 2002)</ref>. Specifically, the right posterior parietal cortex (PPC) has been associated with directing attention towards salient stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Hodsoll et al., 2009)</ref>. Said salient stimuli may require immediate attention in order to adaptively respond to threat.</p><p>It is suggested that visual selection of threatening stimuli is mediated by a fast, subcortical, magnocellular pathway bypassing early visual cortex <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bocanegra &amp; Zeelenberg, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Lojowska et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Tamietto &amp; De Gelder, 2010)</ref>. Several authors argue that such a phylogenetically older, retinotectal pathway interacts with cortical networks and modulates visual perception and attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(LeDoux, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr">Tamietto &amp; De Gelder, 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">, Vuilleumier, 2005)</ref>. Indeed, emotionally salient stimuli appear to elicit earlier neural responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Carretié et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr">Pourtois et al., 2005)</ref> and seem prioritized in visual search <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Öhman et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Mulckhuyse &amp; Dalmaijer, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Notebaert et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Schmidt et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Yiend, 2010)</ref>.</p><p>To gain more precise understanding of the role of the PPC when orienting to emotionally relevant stimuli, we used an adaptation of a single pulse TMS study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Chambers et al. (2004)</ref> in which the time-course of reorienting to behaviorally relevant stimuli <ref type="bibr">(targets)</ref> was investigated in a spatial cueing task. Chambers et al. applied single pulse TMS individually and unilaterally to the supramarginal gyrus (SMG) and the angular gyrus (AG) after target onset. No effects were found for validly cued trials where no reorientation was required. In contrast, for invalidly cued trials a significantly decreased response accuracy was observed. This decrease occurred in a biphasic pattern during 90-120 ms and 210-240 ms after target onset (SOA) and was noted for the right AG only. The authors hypothesized that both fast and slower visual pathways may be distinctly relevant to the observed response pattern. As such, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Chambers et al. (2004)</ref> suggested a retinotectal and a geniculostriate pathway as potential explanation and underlying cause for the observed biphasic involvement of the right AG in reorientation of attention.</p><p>In the present study, involvement of the right AG was closer evaluated under the premise of a threatening target. Assuming prioritization of threatening stimuli occurs via a retinotectal pathway, faster processing is anticipated for threatening targets compared to nonthreatening targets. Therefore, reorienting to an emotionally relevant target is expected to be mediated by the right AG at an earlier time window than reorienting to a non-emotionally relevant target. Moreover, high anxious individuals demonstrate faster orienting, especially to briefly presented highly aversive stimuli <ref type="bibr">(Cisler &amp; Koster, 2010)</ref>. However, to our knowledge this has never been investigated in the context of re-orienting to threat in a spatial cueing task.</p><p>To preserve comparability, the experimental setup and methodology of <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Chambers et al. (2004)</ref> was largely followed, but with a larger sample size (N=3 in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Chambers et al. (2004)</ref> versus N=22 in the current study). As such, a spatial cueing task and single pulse TMS was used with healthy subjects. To introduce a threatening stimulus, differential fear conditioning was applied. Similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Chambers et al. (2004)</ref>, we expected no effect of TMS for the validly cued trials, but a TMS modulation for the invalidly cued trials. That is, we expected an earlier decrease in response accuracy to invalidly cued threatening targets compared to safe targets.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants and ethics</head><p>The present sample size was oriented on findings by <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Chambers at al. (2004)</ref> who reported significant effects with ~230 observations per data point given three participants. Assuming a small to medium effect size (f = 0.20), an alpha of 0.05 (two tailed), and power of 0.90, an initial G*Power analysis for conventional analysis of variance indicated a sample of 18 participants. A total of 22 right-handed volunteers, 9 males and 13 females, aged 19 to 26, participated with a mean STAI score of 36.23 (SD= 9.26; Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</p><p>All subjects were screened for contraindications to non-invasive brain stimulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Keel et al., 2001)</ref>, history of psychiatric or neurological disease, color blindness, and vision problems. Consequently, all subjects were healthy and had normal or corrected to normal vision. Prior to the investigation, informed consent was obtained in writing, while research objectives remained unknown to the subjects. The study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of the Radboud University Medical Center Nijmegen (NL52504.091.15 CMO Region Arnhem-Nijmegen, The Netherlands). TMS stimulation parameters were in agreement with the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology safety guidelines <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Rossi et al., 2009)</ref> and in accordance with the standards set by the Declaration of Helsinki.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Apparatus and Stimuli</head><p>The experimental task was administered using E-prime 2.0 and responses were recorded via the Serial Response Box (Psychology Software Tools, Sharpsburg, Inc., PA, USA). Stimuli were displayed using a BENQ XL 2420T monitor with a refresh rate of 100 Hz. A light grey fixation cross (0.5 cm) was presented in the centre of a dark grey background. The cue consisted of a white filled circle (0.8 cm) presented 8.5 cm to either the left or the right of fixation. The target stimulus consisted of a square (1.2 cm * 1.2 cm) made up of eleven blue or yellow line elements which were presented 8.5 cm to either the left or the right of fixation. The line elements were matched for luminance (39 𝑐𝑑 𝑚 2 ) and tilted 45° to either the right or to the left side. The mask was a random pattern of black line elements (1.5 cm*1.5 cm) presented at the location of the target stimulus. Shocks were applied using a Digitimer Constant Current Stimulator DS7A (www.digitimer.com) and standard Ag/AgCl electrodes attached to the fourth and fifth phalanges of the left hand. The maximum intensity stimulus consisted of 10 pulses of 1 ms length and 19.75 ms ISI, administered during a 200 ms time-interval at 50 Hz with a maximum intensity of 6 mA.</p><p>The right AG was localized using scalp coordination marked on T1-weighted MRI scans and Brainsight (Rogue Research Inc., Montreal, Quebec, Canada) neuronavigation. Here, the right AG was defined as the region directly adjacent to the dorsolateral projection of the superior temporal sulcus, which bifurcates the AG <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Chambers et al., 2004)</ref>. At the target area the TMS coil was placed tangential to the scalp with the handle pointing caudally in a fixating custom coil holder. TMS was delivered with a biphasic pulse configuration using a MC-B65-HO figure-of-8 coil (MagVenture, Farum, Denmark) connected to a Magpro-X-100 magnetic stimulator (MagVenture, Farum, Denmark).</p><p>To measure trait anxiety, participants filled out The Trait Anxiety Inventory Questionnaire (STAI-T; <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Spielberger et al., 1970;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Van der Ploeg, 1980)</ref>. Subjective ratings were obtained using Likert scales (ranging from 1, "not at all," to 9, "extremely"). To measure subjective fear towards the CS+ and CS-stimuli, participants were asked to indicate the extent to which they felt anxious or fearful when they saw the blue (yellow) lines. To measure contingency awareness (i.e., the association between the CS+ stimuli with a chance of receiving an electric shock), participants were asked to what extent they expected to receive a shock when the blue (yellow) lines were presented. In addition, participants were asked to judge the intensity, unpleasantness and fear of the US stimulus (shocks) also using a Likert scale.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Design</head><p>The spatial cueing task consisted of twenty blocks of 44 trials that were divided over two separate sessions due to the length of the experiment. The sessions were on different days with at least one week in between. In half of the trials the CS+ and the other half the CS-target was presented. The cue was 50% valid. Single pulse TMS was applied at one of 10 different intervals following target onset, or no TMS was applied. These 10 stimulus-onset asynchronies (SOA) were 30-300 ms long (30 ms increments). All trials were presented randomly within a block. In each block two CS+ trials were additionally reinforced with a shock 800 ms after target onset <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Mackintosh, 1983)</ref>. Here, no TMS pulse was applied. Said reinforcement trials were excluded from analyses. Hence, a total of 880 experimental trials were considered in final analyses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure</head><p>In the first session, resting motor threshold (MT) was determined for the right hemisphere using the thumb movement visualization method after single pulse TMS <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Schutter &amp; van Honk, 2006)</ref>. Subsequently, TMS output was set at 110% and lowered in case of muscular artefacts.</p><p>The resulting TMS output and the following procedure were used in both sessions. The experiment started with a practice session of 32 trials. Here, a mock-up TMS (upwards pointing coil) was used. Participants with at least 85% accuracy in practice trials were permitted to begin the next phase, otherwise they had to repeat the practice session. Subsequently, electrodes were attached and intensity of shock output was determined with a calibration procedure. A standardized staircase procedure comprising five shocks <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Cornsweet, 1962)</ref> was used. The participants reported shock unpleasantness verbally on a scale from 1-5 where 1 corresponds with "not at all" and 5 with "very much." For each subject the level of shock unpleasantness was set at 4. Then the fear conditioning acquisition phase started that consisted of 16 trials, in which the yellow (8 trials) or blue target stimulus (8 trials) was presented for 1000ms. Participants were asked to observe but did not have to respond to the target stimulus. One of the colors was paired with a shock (CS+) at stimulus offset, whereas the other color was not (CS-). Reinforced colors were consistent for each participant between sessions and counterbalanced between subjects. After the acquisition phase, participants were asked to indicate which color was linked to the shock. Correct identification of the conditioned stimulus was necessary to continue the study.</p><p>Each experimental trial began with 1250 ms presentation of a fixation cross and additional jitter between 50 ms and 250 ms (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Subsequently, the cue was presented for 100 ms and appeared randomly in equal distribution (50%) either left or right from the fixation cross. After a delay of 150 ms, the target was presented for 120 ms followed by a random pattern mask of black lines for 140 ms. Participants were instructed to identify the orientation of the line-elements as either "left" or "right" by pressing "1" with their right index finger for left orientation and "2" with their right middle finger for right orientation. Each trial ended when a response was given, i.e., there was no constraint for the response time After each block of 44 trials, participants received feedback about their response accuracy.</p><p>Here, breaks were allowed, and the position of the coil was inspected and readjusted if needed.</p><p>After completion of each session, contingency and fear ratings for CS+ and CS-as well as ratings of intensity, unpleasantness, and fear of the US were obtained. At the end of session two, participants filled out the English or Dutch version of the trait anxiety inventory questionnaire (STAI-T; <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Spielberger et al., 1970;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Van der Ploeg, 1980)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical analysis</head><p>Statistical analyses were carried out in R (Version 3.5.1; R Core team, 2016). Accuracy was coded as a binary variable for which logistic mixed-effects models were implemented via the glmer function (lmer4 package, version: 3.3.1, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bates et al., 2014)</ref>. Each model included fixed effects for cue validity (valid and invalid condition), threat condition (CS+, CS-), and TMS condition (present vs. absence of TMS; or TMS stimulus onset asynchrony (SOAs), as well as the interactions between cue validity, threat condition, and TMS. All models included random intercepts for each subject. Session number (1,2) was used as a covariate. We included STAI in the model to examine whether individual differences in trait anxiety can explain the behavioral responses. We also examined the effects of TMS on RT, and whether RT can explain accuracy (RT-accuracy tradeoff).</p><p>Due to the complexity of our models, we did not employ a maximal random-effects structure <ref type="bibr">(Barr et al., 2013)</ref>, but report results from a simpler random intercepts only model for all analyses. In Wilkinson-Rogers notation, the GLMEs models for accuracy analysis writes as follows:</p><p>Correct = Cue validity * Threat condition * TMS (TMS-SOAs) + Session + (1| Subject) As a general strategy, we first used an omnibus model investigating the main effects of cue validity, threat condition, TMS, and their interactions. To this end, p-values were determined using Type 3 Likelihood Ratio Tests implemented in the mixed function of the package afex <ref type="bibr">(Singmann et al., 2018)</ref>. In logistic mixed-effect models, odds ratio and their 95% CI were calculated as a measure of significance of the effects. In linear mixed effects models with RT as dependent variable, point estimates (B) were used as a measure of the magnitude of the effects using lmerTest package <ref type="bibr">(Kuznetsova et al., 2017)</ref>. In the model testing the influence of RT on accuracy, we used a log of RT in the analysis to correct for its skewed distribution. In all models, continuous predictors (ratings of STAI-T and log RT) were centered, and all categorical predictors were coded using sum coding.</p><p>Trials on which shocks were delivered, as well as trials in which participants gave too short or too long responses (for no-TMS: faster than 150 ms, and for TMS: faster than 350 ms, and for both conditions longer than 3000 ms) were excluded (1.38% of all trials). These cutoffs were used to ensure that the trials used in the analysis reflect the actual responses to the target (&lt;150ms and &lt; 3000ms), andin case of TMSthat only trials following the TMS pulse were included (max. SOA-TMS was 300 ms, therefore the cut-off for TMS trials was set to 350 ms). Subsequently, we excluded RT outliers at individual level based on +/-2.5SD criterion from the mean (2.70% of all trials). Furthermore, we excluded trials for which there were large timing inaccuracies with regard to the timing of the TMS pulse from final analyses. The timing of the TMS pulse for each SOA condition showed high variances with standard deviations between 3.78 ms and 11.20 ms. Based on bimodal SOA distributions (see Supplementary Material, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref>), a 4 ms cut-off criterion above the expected timing of the TMS pulse was chosen, and trials falling within this criterion were included in the analysis (e.g., for a TMA SOA of 30 ms, trials in which a TMS pulse was delivered until 34 ms were included in the analysis). Following this criterion, 17.86% of the trials were excluded from the analysis. An analysis including trials showing high TMS-SOA variability yielded similar results (Supplementary Materials Table <ref type="table">S9</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Manipulation check: Fear conditioning</head><p>Fear conditioning was successful both in terms of subjective fear and contingency awareness.</p><p>We first examined participants' ratings of fear and contingency for the CS+ and CS-stimuli, and whether these scores differed between the two sessions. A main effect of threat condition on fear rating F(1,21) = 33.23, p &lt;. 001, showed that the participants experienced more fear in response to the CS+ stimulus (M = 3.57, SD = 1.73) than the CS-stimulus (M = 1.32, SD = 0.75, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). A main effect of threat condition on contingency ratings F(1,21) = 97.63, p &lt;. 001, indicated that the participants expected to receive shocks more during the CS+ (M = 4.16, SD = 1.29) than during the CS-stimuli (M = 1.14, SD = 0.35). Importantly, the interaction between threat condition and session number was non-significant for the ratings of fear F(1,21) = 3.32, p = .083, and contingency F(1,21) = 0.27, p =. 608, suggesting that these ratings did not differ between the two sessions.</p><p>Next, we verified whether the ratings of the US (shocks) were significantly higher than the minimum possible rating, (i.e., 1). One-sample t-tests confirmed that this was the case for shock intensity (M = 4.61, SD = 1.53, t(21) = 9.21, p &lt; .001), unpleasantness (M = 4.41, SD = 1.74; t(21) = 11.04, p &lt; .001), and 'fear of receiving a shock' (M = 3.89, SD = 1.82; t(21) = 7.05, p &lt; .001). Importantly, the US ratings did not differ between the sessions, as indicated by a non-significant interaction between the session and threat condition for the ratings of intensity F(1,21) = 0.15 , p =.706 , unpleasantness F(1,21) = 0.88, p =.358, and fear F(1,21) = 0.20, p =.658. Overall, these results suggest that fear conditioning was successful in our study. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>No time-specific interference of attentional orienting or reorienting</head><p>First, we focused on the time delineated effects of TMS per SOA. To identify the effects of TMS-SOA, our analysis involved a full interaction model with the following predictors: TMS-SOA, cue validity and threat condition, and accuracy as the dependent variable. Session number</p><p>(1,2) was used as a covariate. We found a significant main effect of cue validity, where the odds of correct responses were significantly larger in valid than in invalid trials, indicating that the peripheral cue captured attention, OR = 0.67, 95% CI [0.64, 0.71], χ 2 (1) = 252.68, p &lt; .001 (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>). We also found a main effect of session on accuracy, indicating that participants performance improved with time OR = 1.44, 95% CI [1.37, 1.51], χ 2 (1) = 49.37, p &lt; .001. The interactions between the cue validity and TMS-SOA, and between cue validity, threat condition and TMS-SOA were non-significant (p &gt; .05; full model results are provided in the accuracy for the four TMS-SOAs within the time-windows of interest (for the first timewindow, we used the following TMS-SOAs: 60 ms 90 ms, 120 ms, 150 ms; for the second time-window, we used the following TMS-SOAs: 190 ms, 210 ms, 240 ms and 270 ms). None of these comparisons yielded a significant interaction effect between the cue validity and TMS-SOA, as well as between cue validity, threat condition and TMS-SOA (p &gt; .05, see Supplementary Material, Table <ref type="table">S3</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>TMS induced interference of target processing in contralateral visual field, irrespective of threat and cue-validity</head><p>Since laterality effects are a common finding in TMS studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bourgeois et al., 2013</ref>; see for review <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Duecker &amp; Sack, 2015)</ref>, we probed our data for laterality effects and tested whether the SOAvalidity interaction is dependent on visual field by adding target location to our model.</p><p>There was a significant main effect of the location of the target on accuracy, with higher accuracy for targets presented in the right (M = 0.85, SD = 0.36) than the left visual field (M = 0.82, SD = 0.39), indicating a typical laterality effect of TMS in the contralateral visual field OR = 0.87, 95% CI [0.83, 0.91], χ 2 (1) = 29.37, p &lt; .001. The interaction between TMS-SOA and target location was non-significant, χ 2 (9) = 13.27, p = .151. For full model results see Supplementary Material Table <ref type="table">S4</ref>). An analysis specifically focusing on targets in the left visual field in the invalid trials did not yield any significant effects (p &gt;.05, see Supplementary</p><p>Material Table <ref type="table">S5</ref>). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>TMS induced interference of threat processing</head><p>To determine the overall effect of TMS on orienting and reorienting towards safe and threat targets, we collapsed across all SOAs, testing the effects of TMS, cue validity and threat on accuracy. Similar to the full model that included TMS-SOA, we found a main effect of cue validity, OR = 0.72 , 95% CI [0.66, 0.77], χ 2 (1) = 73.52, p &lt; .001 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">6</ref>), and a main effect of session, OR = 1.41 , 95% CI [1.29, 1.55], χ 2 (1) = 51.19, p &lt; .001. In addition, we found a main effect of TMS, indicating better accuracy during no-TMS as compared to TMS stimulation OR = 1.09, 95% CI [1.00, 1.17], χ 2 (1) = 4.68, p = .030. Critically, the interaction between TMS and threat was marginally significant, χ 2 (1) = 3.83, p = .050. The remaining interactions were non-significant (p &gt; .05). Full model results are provided in Supplementary Material Table <ref type="table">S6</ref>. The follow-up analysis of the significant interaction between threat and TMS condition revealed a significant difference in accuracy between CS+ and CS-condition in the no-TMS condition (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">7</ref>). Specifically, in the no-TMS condition, the participants showed higher accuracy during threat (M= 0.87, SD = 0.33) than during safe trials (M =0.84, SD = 0.36), OR = 0.86, 95% CI [0.75, 0.99], χ 2 (1) =3.94, p = .047. The difference between threat and safe trials in TMS condition was non-significant, OR = 1.00, 95% CI [0.96, 1.05], χ 2 (1) =0.04, p = .838. AG in re-orienting in the presence of both non-threatening and threatening stimuli, which is inconsistent with the findings reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Chambers et al (2004)</ref>.</p><p>It is important to note that in the current task re-orienting was induced by a salient but at the same time task relevant stimulus. In the model by <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Corbetta and Shulman (2002)</ref>, a right lateralized ventral frontal network is activated when a task relevant stimulus is detected outside the focus of attention. This network consists of the temporoparietal junction (TPJ) and ventral frontal cortex (VFC), in which the rTPJ is supposed to act as a circuit breaker of ongoing task sets <ref type="bibr">(Doricchi et al., 2010)</ref>. Indeed, previous TMS studies showed that in addition to parietal regions, the rTPJ is involved in exogenous spatial attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bourgeois et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Chica et al., 2011)</ref>. The role of the ventral network as a circuit breaker is especially highlighted in a study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Chang et al. (2013)</ref>, in which TMS to rTPJ modulated re-orienting to task relevant distractors, whereas stimulating rFEF did not <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Chang et al., 2013)</ref>. In the current study, the target stimulus was not only task relevant but in addition biologically significant as it signaled either threat or safety. Detection of biologically significant stimuli outside the focus of attention is also said to be mediated by the ventral network <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Corbetta &amp; Shulman, 2002)</ref>. Possibly, in our study, detection of biologically significant targets outside the attended field relied more on rTPJ than rPPC activation (but see <ref type="bibr">Mulckhuyse et al., 2017)</ref>. Subsequently, the act of voluntarily re-orienting towards the target was mediated in conjunction with the bilateral frontoparietal network <ref type="bibr">(Vossel et al., 2008)</ref>. If indeed re-orienting was mediated by the bilateral frontoparietal network, unilateral interference of the right AG may then affect re-orienting less.</p><p>For example, in a study that used an Attentional Network Task (ANT) in which right PPC was inhibited with continuous theta-burst stimulation (cBTS) no effect was found on orienting, while effects on alerting and executive functioning did emerge <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Middag-van Spanje et al., 2022)</ref>. The authors attributed the lack of an effect on orienting to the unilateralized stimulation, since voluntarily orienting of attention is mediated by the bilateral frontoparietal network. If reorienting in our study was mediated by the bilateral frontoparietal network, a single pulse to right AG might not have sufficed to interfere with reorienting. Indeed, most TMS studies on spatial attention used a train of pulses (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Heinen et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Silvanto et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Taylor et al., 2011</ref>, see for review <ref type="bibr">Seghier, 2022)</ref>, which might be necessary to affect re-orienting processes. However, a recent study using online repetitive TMS and offline inhibitory stimulation of left IPS on temporal orienting also found no evidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Capizzi et al., 2023)</ref>.</p><p>Similar to spatial orienting, the network involved in temporal orienting is widespread. Capizzi et al. tentatively suggested that interference of a specific node in a widespread network may be compensated for by activity in these other brain areas. This may also explain why we did not find impaired reorienting in our study.</p><p>Even though our stimulation protocol may not have been effectively interfering with re-orienting, we did find an effect of target location, irrespective of cue validity and threat.</p><p>Performance was decreased to targets presented contralateral to TMS stimulation, which is in accordance with previous TMS studies that stimulated rPPC in various spatial attention tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bourgeois et al., 2013</ref>; see for review <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Duecker &amp; Sack, 2015)</ref>. Therefore, our finding seems to corroborate the involvement of right AG in spatial attention, although it does not provide evidence for a dominant right lateralized role in re-orienting to emotional stimuli.</p><p>We conclude that single pulse TMS to right AG does not interfere with reorienting in an exogenous spatial cueing task. These results are inconsistent with <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Chambers et al. (2004)</ref>.</p><p>Possibly, detection of biologically significant stimuli outside the focus of attention relies more on involvement of the right lateralized ventral frontoparietal network after which re-orienting is mediated by the bilateral dorsal frontoparietal network. Future repetitive TMS studies could elucidate the role of the rTPJ in reorienting to biologically significant stimuli outside the focus of attention.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1</figDesc></figure>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>The present study elaborates on findings by <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Chambers et al. (2004)</ref> who reported interference with attentional reorienting during invalid trials in an exogenous spatial cueing task at two time-windows (90-120 ms and 210-240 ms) when TMS was applied to the right AG. Objective of the present study was to further investigate the nature and time course of right-AG involvement when reorienting attention towards threatening stimuli. Extending the wellestablished spatial cueing paradigm, a fear conditioned target was introduced to allow for an evaluation of emotional response patterns. The fear conditioned target was expected to induce prioritized processing and hence earlier re-orienting to the invalidly cued threatening target.</p><p>Therefore, we expected TMS to interfere with performance to invalidly cued threatening targets at earlier time-windows compared to safe targets.</p><p>Subjective ratings indicated that fear-conditioning was successful. Participants were aware of the contingency between the color and the shock and were more afraid when the CS+ was presented relative to the CS-. Furthermore, in the No-TMS condition the cueing effect was stronger for the CS+ target trials than the CS-target trials, which was driven by better performance on the valid CS+ trials. This indicates enhanced orienting to threatening information <ref type="bibr">(Koster et al., 2004)</ref>.</p><p>During the TMS trials, an overall cueing effect was consistently observed, confirming a large body of prior work <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Posner, 1980)</ref>. Performance was improved in valid compared to invalid trials. This finding demonstrates that the cueing paradigm was effective. Specifically, the peripheral cue captured attention and facilitated performance for targets at the attended location (valid trials) and impaired performance for targets at the unattended location (invalid trials). However, no effect of TMS was observed during re-orienting, neither for threat nor for safe trials. If we assume that attention had to be re-oriented from the cue to the opposite target during invalid trials, our findings do not provide any evidence for the mediation of the right</p></div>			</div>
