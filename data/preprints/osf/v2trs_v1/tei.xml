<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Significant impacts of climate change on the energy sector in Sub-Saharan Africa could lead to this sector configurations marked by energy services supply alteration, energy services quality reduction and energy services access degradation. Such configurations of the energy sector are factors that could reduce resilience options for economic and social sectors. In the context of sub-Saharan Africa, energy sector resilience to climate change should be a crucial component of overall resilience to climate change. In practice, it will require the development of specific knowledge bodies and decision-making tools for the design, planning, management, monitoring and evaluation of the energy sector resilience policies which concern energy services supply, energy services quality, energy services demand and energy services access. The main output of this article is the Badolo EnergyResilienceProspect framework. It is a scientific tool for the formulation, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of energy sector resilience to climate change policies based on resilience configurations that secure energy services supply, energy services quality and energy services access. Basically, the Badolo EnergyResilienceProspect framework is an innovative scientific tool to improve the efficiency and impact of energy resilience to climate change policies.

Such configurations of the energy sector are factors that could reduce resilience options for economic and social sectors <ref type="bibr">[6 -9]</ref>. In the context of sub-Saharan Africa, energy sector resilience to climate change should be a crucial component of overall resilience to climate change. In practice, it will require the development of specific knowledge bodies and decision-making tools for the design, planning, management, monitoring and evaluation of the energy sector resilience policies which concern energy services supply, energy services quality, energy services demand and energy services access. These energy sector resilience policies should be low-carbon and integrate contextual specificities, gender issues and social inclusion. <ref type="bibr">[10 -12]</ref>. In this article, we propose the Badolo EnergyResilienceProspect framework, a scientific tool for energy sector resilience to climate change. It uses ClimResilience scientific framework methodological tools, concepts and decision support tools to develop an inclusive and participatory scheme for energy sector results-based policies formulation, implementation, monitoring and evaluation <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. It includes specific climate change impacts, vulnerability factors, vulnerability indicators and resilience solutions families for the improvement of the scientific bases of energy sector resilience to climate change policies. The energy sector resilience trajectories of the Badolo EnergyResilienceProspect framework are results-based trajectories resulting from climate change impact classes. They achieve energy sector resilience configurations that secure energy services supply, energy services quality and energy services access. Basically, the Badolo EnergyResilienceProspect framework is an innovative scientific tool to improve the efficiency and impact of energy sector climate change resilience policies. It suggests results-based energy sector resilience policies, taking into account contextual specificities, gender issues, social inclusion and greenhouse gas emissions reduction.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p>The design, management, monitoring and evaluation of energy sector climate change resilience policies requires several types of knowledge bodies and decision support tools. They should be robust, contextual, multidimensional and integrate gender issues, social inclusion and greenhouse gas emissions reduction. They concern change impacts, vulnerability factors, resilience solutions and resilience trajectories. The knowledge bodies and decision support tools of the Badolo EnergyResilienceProspect framework meet the criteria of relevance and robustness for energy sector resilience policies. They consider several dimensions of the energy sector, are contextual and designed to underpin results-based resilience policies. Climate change impacts families integrate energy sector management, development achievements and prospects, financing and the governance. Vulnerability factors families include energy sector characteristics and contextual situations to be addressed to mitigate climate change impacts. Knowledge and decision support tools for energy sector resilience policies are addressed by several scientific publications <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. The Badolo EnergyResilienceProspect framework increases the knowledge for managing the threats posed by climate change to the energy sector and proposes novel approaches to accelerate the realization of energy sector resilience configurations. The Badolo EnergyResilienceProspect framework includes several innovations for energy sector resilience policies to climate change. They result specifically from the implementation of the concepts of climate change indirect impacts, residual impacts, residual vulnerabilities, classes of impacts, resilience trajectories segments and resilience configurations. The resilience trajectories of the Badolo EnergyResilienceProspect framework achieve energy sector resilience configurations that secure energy services supply, energy services quality and energy services access. Such a situation of securing energy services is the marker of energy sector climate change resilience policies efficiency.</p></div>
