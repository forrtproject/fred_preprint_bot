<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>To face ecological disasters, one of the major emergencies of modern times, fostering proenvironmental behaviors appears crucial. While research explored various behavioral drivers, few studies addressed the conceptual representation of ecological events at different ages. Our preregistered study fills this gap, examining how different generations conceptualize ecology, considering evidence suggesting a link between climate change abstractness and willingness to act pro-environmentally.</p><p>Older (&gt;65 yo) and younger (18-35 yo) individuals performed multiple tasks targeting conceptual processing (categorization), semantic organization (rating), and conceptual representation (feature generation) of ecological (e.g., deforestation) compared to concrete (e.g., spoon) and abstract (e.g., affirmation) concepts. In the categorization task, participants responded to critical ecological, concrete, and abstract words but refrained from responding to animal words. The rating task involved evaluating critical words on semantic aspects (e.g., Abstractness, Familiarity), and the feature generation task listing properties true for each concept. Innovatively, participants were tested in three possible settings (indoor, natural outdoor, urbanized outdoor) to test whether exposure to nature impacts categorization.</p><p>Results showed that independent from the setting, ecological concepts were similar to abstract concepts, especially in semantic organization and conceptual representation, or more abstractly characterized than them, especially in conceptual processing. Age differences were minimal, but older adults, who showed more positive attitudes toward ecology and nature, characterized ecological concepts more concretely than younger adults.</p><p>Theoretically, the multifarious characterization of ecological phenomena supports the flexibility of our conceptual system and points to the necessity of overcoming the classical concrete-abstract dichotomy and studying concepts in a more "situated" manner. From a societal point of view, the age-dependent abstractness of ecological concepts might inform policies on how to improve climate change campaigns, tailoring them for different age groups.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Significance Statement</head><p>One of the most pressing issues in the current world is the ecological emergency. Human activity has significantly impacted the environment, as seen in phenomena such as the greenhouse effect and the depletion of the ozone layer, both of which contribute to rising global temperatures and threaten ecosystems.</p><p>Psychological research can play a vital role in examining how humans face ecological events and behaviorally counteract them. In the field, there are some contributions on factors driving pro-environmental behaviors, but just a few have explored the role of cognitive representations.</p><p>Understanding how people conceptualize ecological problems is crucial, as world-meaning often drives motivation to behave. Additionally, cognitive resources and needs might vary across age groups, affecting how problems are framed.</p><p>One way to assess how real ecological issues are perceived, particularly in relation to age, is by exploring their level of abstractness, in light of evidence showing a positive link between concreteness and predisposition to act. The current work addresses this issue for the first time, investigating through multiple tasks how abstractly older and younger adults conceptualize ecological events, from different perspectives (conceptual processing, organization, and representation).</p><p>Results show that ecological concepts are perceived as mostly abstract by both generations, but as more concrete in older adults, who also showed more positive attitudes toward environmental protection. This evidence might be helpful in informing climate change policies.</p><p>Indeed, effective environmental strategies should begin with an understanding of people's knowledge, even before addressing emotional responses. Subtle age differences in cognitive representations can inform tailored interventions that may increase shared motivation and cooperation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The ecological emergency has become a crucial object of debate in contemporary Western societies. Numerous studies in biology, engineering, demography, and other disciplines focused on the causes and consequences of this phenomenon. However, a pivotal key to reducing damage to the environment is human behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(Sinclair et al., 2025;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Ferguson &amp; Schmitt, 2021)</ref>. In psychology, some studies addressed individual factors-beliefs, motivations, and subjective norms-leading to pro-environmental behaviors, such as recycling (review in <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Li et al., 2019)</ref>. Other studies focused on risk perception and affective responses to ecological disasters and on collective behaviors and norms (review in <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Tam et al., 2021)</ref>. The literature on concepts, i.e., on how people think and what they know about the domain related to ecological issues, instead, is extremely scarce (for an exception, <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Malt &amp; Majid, 2023)</ref>.</p><p>Concepts are the minimal units of knowledge, which link past, present, and future experiences, allow classifying entities and objects and drawing inferences <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Kemmerer, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr">Murphy, 2002)</ref>. The most common way to investigate concepts is studying the meaning of the words expressing them <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Barsalou, 1999)</ref>. Recent studies focus on whether people feel part of the nature <ref type="bibr">(Pizza &amp; Kelemen, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Flusberg &amp; Thibodeau, 2023)</ref>, how people from different cultures conceptualize natural elements, like landscapes <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Striedl et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">van Putten et al., 2020)</ref>, or forests <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Burenhult et al., 2017)</ref> (review in <ref type="bibr">Falcinelli et al., 2024c)</ref>, or test what people know about ecological issues <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Ranney &amp; Clark, 2016)</ref>. However, to our knowledge, no study directly focuses on concepts we have called "ecological", such as ozone hole 1 , climate change and pollution, which refer to the ecological emergency (for an exception, <ref type="bibr">Falcinelli et al., 2024a)</ref>.</p><p>Interestingly, a branch within the psychological field has addressed the relationship between ecological events and age-groups. Some contributions investigated the effects of ecological issues on wellbeing <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">(Tsevreni et al., 2023)</ref>, focusing on eco-anxiety, a new form of distress caused by the unpredictability and uncontrollability of ecological disasters <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Pihkala, 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Younger adults show higher levels of eco-anxiety than older adults and express greater concerns about ecological issues <ref type="bibr">(APA, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Hill-Harding et al., 2025)</ref>. Conversely, ecological phenomena generate more physical consequences for older adults since it can exacerbate pre-existing medical conditions (e.g., air pollution can aggravate breathing problems - <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Ayalon et al., 2023)</ref>.</p><p>Also the studies on the relationships between intentions, motivations, and pro-environmental behaviors have highlighted intergenerational differences. Younger adults are more interested in ecological topics <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Clayton, 2020)</ref>, have more pro-environmental attitudes <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">(Wiernik et al., 2013)</ref> and are more willing to engage in climate activism than older adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Ballew et al., 2020)</ref>. Daily, older people more frequently engage in pro-environmental behaviors <ref type="bibr">(Wang et al., 2021)</ref>, such as using less electric power, recycling more, and purchasing more carefully <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(López-Mosquera et al., 2015)</ref> and also show more positive habits towards nature than younger adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Scott et al., 2015)</ref>. Overall, younger people's "call to action" expresses more ideologically (activism) than in terms of actual eco-friendly behaviors <ref type="bibr">(Ágoston et al., 2024)</ref>. This difference might occur because younger adults may feel more helpless and perceive environmental action as primarily the responsibility of powerful entities like politicians <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Sarrasin et al., 2022)</ref>. Conversely, older adults, transitioning from full workers to retired, might increase their prosocial behaviors (review in <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Georganas et al., 2022)</ref>.</p><p>Curiously, despite the divergences in the psycho-physical wellbeing, attitudes, and behaviors, a comprehensive review reports limited differences between younger and older people in the knowledge concerning climate change <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Corner et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Innovatively, our study allows us to understand whether the different ways older and younger adults deal with ecological emergencies are due to different ways to conceive ecological concepts-for example, intending them as more abstract or concrete. Several contributions provide evidence on age-dependent variations in conceptualization, revealing significant differences not only in the quantity <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Dubossarsky et al., 2017)</ref>, structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Cosgrove et al., 2021)</ref> and content of knowledge related to a conceptual domain <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">(Vignando et al., 2018)</ref>, but also in its level of abstractness (review in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Borghi &amp; Setti, 2017)</ref>. In addition, a recent work shows that, regardless of age, the more people have experience and familiarity-two key points of concreteness <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Barca et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Mazzuca, Arcovito et al., 2025;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Villani et al., 2022</ref>)-with "climate change", the more coherent and consistent the mental models brought to cope with that problem are likely to be <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Bostrom, 2017)</ref>. Taken together, this evidence suggests that testing changes in the level of abstractness of ecological concepts across age groups may help deepen our understanding of the development of pro-environmental attitudes and behaviors across the lifespan and implement efficient age-tailored interventions to cope with climate change.</p><p>So, in this work, for the first time, we address how different generations conceive ecological concepts, and we did so by employing multiple tasks inspired by cognitive studies on categorization. Theoretically, aside from the possible impact of this study in everyday life, investigating ecological concepts can advance research on categorization for various aspects.</p><p>First, because the extensive use of ecological concepts is relatively recent, they are ideal to understand whether concepts are flexible and to what extent the introduction of new concepts might lead to reorganizing people's semantic networks. Similarly, the new concept of Covid-19 led people to rearrange their semantic representation of illness <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Mazzuca et al., 2022)</ref>.</p><p>Second, the members of ecological concepts cut across categorical boundaries between natural kinds (e.g., tree) and artifacts (e.g., hammer)-for example, climate, a natural phenomenon, changed due to human intervention. Thus, their study can contribute to a more fine-grained representation of the differences between concept kinds.</p><p>Third, ecological concepts are intriguing because they cut across the classic distinction between concrete concepts (e.g., tree, hammer), typically evoking more sensorimotor experiences, and abstract concepts (e.g., freedom, thought), for which linguistic, inner, and social experience play a major role <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Borghi, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">2025;</ref><ref type="bibr">Mazzuca, Fini et al., 2025)</ref>. A recent rating study shows that ecological concepts figure as "hybrid": for some aspects, they are similar to concrete concepts, while for others, people consider them as equally abstract or even more abstract than abstract concepts <ref type="bibr">(Falcinelli et al., 2024a</ref>; see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Fini et al., 2025)</ref>. Here, we test whether they differ from abstract and concrete concepts in their semantic organization, representation and processing, using ratings, feature generation, and categorization tasks. Testing their hybrid character may be critical since, according to some positions (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Leviston et al., 2014)</ref>, conceptualizing the ecological domain as abstract rather than concrete can explain the resistance to conduct direct pro-environmental actions.</p><p>Aside from research on categorization, our study is also motivated by research on the impact of nature on cognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Cassarino &amp; Setti, 2015)</ref>. Different theories have underlined the restorative power of the contact with nature <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Kaplan, 1995)</ref>, and the positive memories associated with it <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Egner et al., 2000)</ref>. According to the attention restoration theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Kaplan, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Schertz &amp; Berman, 2019)</ref>, immersion in a natural context favors attention focusing due to the reduced stimuli overload <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Linnell et al., 2013)</ref>. Being exposed also shortly to natural contexts favours sustained attention in younger adults, and older adults benefit from the exposure to nature for attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Sia et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Jarosz, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr">but see Cassarino et al., 2019)</ref>.</p><p>The cognitive performances, especially of older adults, are better in natural than in indoor or urbanized outdoor settings (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Hartig et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Kaplan, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Sia et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr">Tan et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Wang et al., 2013)</ref>. There is, however, also contrasting evidence suggesting that urbanized environments, even if crowded with noisy stimuli, represent a source of multisensorial stimulation and brain training for older adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Cassarino &amp; Setti, 2015)</ref>. While research has focused on attention, to our knowledge, no study has investigated the effects of exposure to an outdoor or indoor setting on categorization, as we do here. On a more theoretical perspective-in keeping with the embodied-enactive-embedded-extended view <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Borghi et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Groth &amp; Nimkulrat, 2024)</ref> and the Material Engagement Theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Malafouris, 2013)</ref>concepts may vary depending on the environmental and social interactions in which individuals are here-and-now engaged <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Barsalou et al., 2018)</ref>. Assuming short-term or immediate contexts can modulate conceptual categorization implies acknowledging an even deeper level of semantic flexibility.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">Our Study</head><p>In our study, we address how Italian older (over 65) and younger (18-35) individuals conceptualize the ecological domain, by targeting conceptual processing, semantic organization, and representation through a categorization, a rating and a feature generation task.</p><p>Across tasks, experimental stimuli were ecological concepts (e.g., pollution) along with abstract (e.g., definition) and concrete concepts (e.g., umbrella), used as contrasting categories to explore the hypothesized hybrid nature of the former.</p><p>In the categorization task <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Barca et al., 2020)</ref>, participants read our concepts of interest, i.e., ecological, abstract, and concrete concepts (from now on, "critical concepts"), along with animal concepts, and were required to refrain from responding to animal concepts (or astrological concepts -Appendix A, Supplementary Materials, from now on, "SM"). We examined reaction times (RTs) of older and younger adults for ecological compared to abstract and concrete concepts, considering evidence documenting a processing advantage of concrete over abstract concepts <ref type="bibr">(Concreteness Effect -Paivio, 1990</ref>).</p><p>In the rating task <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Brysbaert et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Lynott et al., 2020)</ref>, we investigated conceptual organization by asking participants to evaluate ecological, abstract, and concrete concepts on dimensions targeting relevant aspects to define abstractness using Likert scales, and then we explored whether ecological concepts appeared more similarly characterized to abstract or concrete concepts across age groups.</p><p>Finally, the feature generation task <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Borghi &amp; Barsalou, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Santos et al., 2011)</ref> required participants to list all features they considered true for ecological, abstract, and concrete concepts. We investigated conceptual representations analyzing the number of listed features for the three conceptual kinds. In addition, to enrich the previous literature on age-dependent differences in the content of ecological knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Corner et al., 2015</ref> -section 1), we also deepened our investigation by exploring the content of features generated by older and younger adults for ecological concepts, by focusing on the most representative concept within our wordpool.</p><p>Innovatively, we tested both younger and older participants across three distinct environmental settings: indoor (a laboratory or a room within a house), naturalistic outdoor (a park or garden), and urban outdoor (a public square or a house's balcony). This design aimed to investigate whether variations in environmental affordances and multisensory stimulation influence semantic processing across age groups (sections 1 and 3.3).</p><p>In line with practices of Open Science, we preregistered the study at the beginning of data collection (except for the "control" categorization task -Appendix A, SM), and we accessed data just once it ended.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.3.">Attitudes towards ecology and nature</head><p>In our experiment we collected some information about the relationship between the two age cohorts and ecology and nature.

Participants answered each question using a 7-point Likert scale, where higher scores indicated higher levels of expertise, update, engagement, and passion, while lower scores indicated the opposite.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Procedure</head><p>The Ethics Committee of the Department of Dynamic and Clinical Psychology, and Health Studies, Sapienza University of Rome (Prot. n. 0002010 -30/11/2022) granted ethics permission. The study was carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The main experiment included two sessions. Each participant attended both sessions in person, with the same experimenter, and within the same setting. For theoretical reasons (please, see sections 1, 1.1, and 1.2 -H3 and H4 hypotheses), three independent groups of participants (n = 16 older and n = 16 younger adults from each age group) were randomly assigned to one of three different quiet and lighting contexts, i.e., a room (indoor condition), a natural outdoor setting (natural outdoor condition), or an urbanized outdoor setting (urbanized outdoor condition).</p><p>Within each condition, the specific setting (e.g., indoor: a house or laboratory's room; natural outdoor: a park or a house's garden; urbanized outdoor: a public square or a house's balcony) was chosen because easily accessible for participants and it varied between them, although we took care in maintaining some constant elements differentiating the three conditions (please, see Table <ref type="table">4</ref>, SM).</p><p>In the first session, which lasted, on average, 15 to 20 minutes, we first required participants to provide socio-demographic information (i.e., age, sex, gender, education level, occupation, native language -for descriptive statistics, see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">S1</ref>, SM), then to perform the categorization task.</p><p>A few days later (up to two weeks), we re-contacted participants for the second session, and they completed the feature generation and then the rating task. Finally, participants provided information on the greenness of the places where they live and their attitudes towards ecology and nature (section 3.2.3 and Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">S1</ref>). The second session took, on average, 1.5 hours per participant.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Tasks</head><p>Categorization. We implemented the task on Psytoolkit<ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">foot_1</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(Stoet, 2017)</ref> and administered it individually on a laptop with a 15-inch monitor. We asked participants to keep their response finger on the spacebar and press it only when words unrelated to animals appeared, responding as soon and accurately as possible (Go/No-Go task). In each trial, a fixation cross appeared for 1000 ms, followed by a written word which remained on the screen until the response or 3000 ms without response. If participants pressed the spacebar when animal words appeared, an error message appeared. A 500 ms black screen concluded each trial (for a similar procedure, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Barca et al., 2020)</ref>. The experiment was preceded by a training phase (20 trials composed of 5 concepts for each category -Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">S2</ref>, SM). Word presentation order was randomized within participants, and no word was used more than once.</p><p>Rating. We asked participants to evaluate abstract, concrete, and ecological concepts on seven semantic dimensions using 7-point Likert scales (section 3.2.2) through a survey implemented on Qualtrics<ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">foot_2</ref> online platform.

Since RTs were not normally distributed, differently from what declared in the preregistration, we analyzed them through a generalized linear mixed model with a log-gamma distribution ("lme4" R's package, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Bates et al., 2015)</ref>. The model featured RTs as dependent variable, Category of Word (Abstract, Concrete, Ecological), Group (Younger, Older), Setting (Indoor, Natural Outdoor, Urbanized Outdoor), and their interaction as fixed effects, and target-words and Participants as random intercepts. The significance of fixed effects and interactions for the model was determined with Type III ANOVAs ("car" R's package, <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Fox &amp; Weisberg, 2019)</ref>, and p-values were calculated using Wald's Chi-squared tests.</p><p>Rating task.

Similarly, both samples emphasized the positive valence of recycling, but older adults more often provided a value judgment, i.e., "Excellent", and younger adults a moral judgment, i.e., "Right". Other associations were instead peculiar to each age group.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Discussion</head><p>Results provide insights into ecological conceptualization, addressing generational differences across multiple data.</p><p>As for conceptual processing (categorization task, section 5.1), older participants were slower in categorizing than younger participants, in keeping with our H1 hypothesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Hultsch et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr">Lucci et al., 2013</ref>; see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Falcinelli et al., 2024b)</ref>.</p><p>In line with the H2.3 hypothesis, older and younger participants processed ecological concepts significantly slower than abstract and concrete concepts. We did not find the classical Concreteness Effect in neither age groups. Its absence may be due to the filler words, i.e., animal concepts. Indeed, the Concreteness Effect was present in the control categorization task (Appendix A, SM), where filler words were astrological entities instead of animals. Inserting animals, usually conceived as concrete concepts, might have interfered with the processing of concrete concepts (artifacts), thus obscuring this effect (Appendix A, SM; for similar results, <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Falcinelli et al., 2024b)</ref>. Finally, contrary to our expectations, there were no processing differences between experimental settings (H3 hypothesis) nor older and younger participants in different contexts (H4 hypothesis). Hence, the context overall, and the exposition to a natural context, did not differently modulate categorization. To our knowledge, our study represents one of the first attempts to verify the impact of the natural setting on categorization. Most studies concern its positive influence on attention, although the results are not unanimous (section 1). Exposure to a natural context may not be sufficient to improve categorization performance for at least two reasons. First, unlike other cognitive processes, the conceptual processing of known concepts may be rather impermeable to the influence of context. Second, the context may play a role, but we were unable to capture it due to methodological limitations.</p><p>One is the absence of a rigorous manipulation of the settings and their variability (section 6.1 for details). In this study, we intentionally adopted an ecological approach to investigate conceptual categorization, preserving the complexity of the scenarios. However, we did not control for the amount or type of multisensory stimulation within each context.</p><p>As to semantic organization (rating task, section 5.2), it did not consistently differ between age groups (contrary to H6 and H7 hypotheses). Indeed, both older and younger adults rated ecological concepts for some aspects strictly similar to abstract concepts and with a more abstract pattern than concrete ones (in line with H5.2 hypothesis)-i.e., more familiar, more mastered, and needing more the help of others to be understood than concrete concepts. For other aspects, both age groups evaluated them at the edge between abstract and concrete concepts (in line with H5.1 hypothesis)-i.e., less abstract, psychologically closer, and less negotiable in meaning than abstract concepts but more abstract, psychologically farther, and more negotiable than concrete ones.</p><p>Although ecological concepts appear at the edge between abstract and concrete concepts in their abstractness score, their semantic characterization leans more toward abstractness.</p><p>In addition, contrary to our expectations (H6 and H7 hypotheses), sometimes older adults characterized ecological concepts less abstractly (i.e., more concretely) than younger adults: they evaluated ecological concepts psychologically closer and more mastered-properties usually related to concreteness <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Mazzuca et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Leviston et al., 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Results on conceptual representation, expressed by feature retrieval, confirmed the more abstract characterization of ecological concepts in both age groups (section 5.3.1). Older and younger adults generated a similar number of features and unique features for ecological and abstract concepts and significantly fewer properties and more unique features for them than for concrete concepts (in line with H9.2 hypothesis and replicating <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Canessa et al., 2021)</ref>. The data on unique features is particularly interesting since it attests that independently from age, ecological concepts might have a "weaker semantic core", being more variable across individuals than concrete concepts, as typically abstract concepts are <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Borghi, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr">Borghi &amp; Mazzuca, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wang &amp; Bi, 2021)</ref>.</p><p>Integrating these findings, by zooming on the content of knowledge related to the ecological domain, specifically to "Recycling" target word (i.e., the most representative concept within our wordpool), results revealed that older participants did not have a less complex, diversified, and experience-driven representation than younger adults, as we expected (H8.1 hypothesis).</p><p>Conversely, the knowledge associated with "Recycling", although sharing common elements, was also differently organized across groups (in line with H8.2 hypothesis). By looking at the most salient listed features, older and younger participants in most cases emphasized similar aspects, enriched with some age-idiosyncratic nuances-for instance, both age groups characterized recycling as something right, but while older adults provided to it a value judgment (Excellent), younger adults a moral one (Right). For other substantial aspects, the most salient features of the two groups differed. For instance, recycling elicited more thoughts about recycled objects in older adults, about its positive outcomes in younger adults. Similarly, older and younger semantic networks of associates did not significantly diverge in content but exhibited age differences. Older adults focused more on reuse and recyclable entities, while younger adults emphasised more the obligatory/voluntary character of recycling, its importance, and the effort it requires. Overall, these findings are consistent with literature showing minimal differences in the content of ecology-related knowledge across the lifespan <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Corner et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Finally, we found significant differences between older and younger adults in their ecology and nature-related attitudes (H10 hypothesis). First, older adults showed more positive attitudes toward ecology than younger ones, describing themselves as more frequently updated on ecology-related topics and more often engaged in ecology-related activities. These results do not entirely align with previous literature suggesting higher scores in such attitudes at a younger life-stage <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Ballew et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Wiernik et al., 2013)</ref>. However, they are still informative as they may contribute to broadening the existing literature on the relationship between older adults and climate change, which is overlooked and sometimes controversial <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Ayalon et al., 2023)</ref>.</p><p>Second, in line with previous evidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Scott et al., 2015)</ref>, older adults exhibited a more positive attitude towards nature than younger adults, perceiving themselves as more expert on nature-related topics, more frequently committed to nature-related habits, and more passionate about nature than younger adults. Although these attitudes did not significantly impact the performances with ecological concepts in the three tasks (Appendix B, SM), the higher level of experiences with ecology and nature in older adults might explain their more concrete characterization of ecological concepts in the rating task, based on previous evidence showing a positive link between expertise/experiences with a domain and its level of concreteness <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Mazzuca, Arcovito et al., 2025;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Villani et al., 2022)</ref>. In addition, it might also elucidate some peculiarities in older adults' verbal production for "Recycling" target word-e.g., both older and younger adults related recycling to the practice of reusing, but while older adults spoke of reuse as something that is usually done, younger adults spoke of it as something that might happen.</p><p>Overall, our study provides evidence that conceptual categorization is a multifaceted process, influenced by a network of interconnected factors including generational differences and life experiences.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.">Study's limitation</head><p>This study is not free from limitations that future research may address. Firstly, our sampling method relied on snowballing, a convenience-based procedure that may limit the representativeness of our findings. Secondly, to be consistent and provide a good extension of the existing Western literature on the relationship between different age groups and climate change (section 1), we tested only Italian younger and older adults. However, further insights might come from comparing more fine-grained distinct age cohorts that cover the entire lifespan (e.g., children, adolescents, younger adults, middle-aged adults, older adults, centenarians) as well as people from different Western and East nationalities. Indeed, this might help strengthen the generalizability of our results. Lastly, our study primarily focused on agegroup differences in ecological and nature-related attitudes (section 3.2.3). Consequently, we didn't collect detailed information on participants' actual pro-environmental behaviors, apart from a general index about the estimated level of engagement of participants with ecologyrelated activities (section 3.2.3). Hence, future studies might better address this aspect by examining whether and how participants' actual pro-environmental behaviors (but also the environmental quality-greenness/pollution-of their living environments) may impact the categorization of ecological phenomena.</p><p>Concerning the setting, as previously noted (section 6), one methodological limitation was the need to sacrifice methodological rigor in favour of a more ecological approach. In addition, the settings were also chosen based on a convenience criterion for participants (e.g., indoor/natural/urbanized places that were easily accessible for them -see section 3.3), thus making the specific testing places differ within each condition (e.g., a garden or a park for the natural outdoor condition -section 3.3), although the presence of some constant elements within each of them (Table <ref type="table">4</ref>, SM). These choices prevented us from rigorously controlling for the multisensory stimulation that participants experienced during the experimental session. The lack of control over these potential confounding variables may have been decisive in preventing context-dependent effects from emerging during conceptual processing.</p><p>In addition, despite our experimental procedure had the strength to include the co-presence of participant and experimenter, thus avoiding the nowadays frequent reliance on online data ("Mturkification", <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Anderson et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">review by Tam et al., 2021)</ref> and allowing to support older adults with the tasks, we cannot exclude an effect of the experimenter's influence over the participants' performance <ref type="bibr">(Yiping, 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Concerning the tasks, it would be worthwhile for future research to exploit other indexes from the feature generation data to shed more light on the hypothesized hybrid nature of ecological concepts-e.g., examining the type of features and their listing order. Indeed, people usually produce more and earlier perceptual features for concrete than abstract concepts <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Breedin et al., 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Canessa et al., 2021)</ref>. Considering these parameters could further allow testing whether ecological concepts are more similar to abstract or concrete ones and verify whether and how this impacts pro-environmental behaviors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Conclusion and study's implications</head><p>This is the first study addressing ecological concepts through the lens of abstractness by targeting different aspects-processing, representation, and organization. We found that ecological concepts are, overall, more similar to abstract concepts (mainly in their semantic organization and representation) or more abstractly characterized than both abstract and concrete concepts (mainly in conceptual processing). There were no stark differences between older and younger participants, but some age-dependent nuances, especially in the knowledge content and semantic organization, with older adults-who showed more positive eco-attitudes -having a more concrete representation of the ecological domain than younger people.</p><p>From a theoretical side, these results support the flexibility of our conceptual system <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Borghi, 2023)</ref>. First, they show that ecological concepts present some characteristics that go beyond the traditional concrete-abstract dichotomy. Indeed, although being more similar to abstract than concrete concepts, they also possess some specific peculiarities (such as their over-abstract characterization). In this sense, our findings align with recent theories proposing to overcome this rigid distinction <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Barsalou et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Borghi et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Banks et al., 2023)</ref>, since it cannot fully explain differences in conceptualizing sub-domains, especially if new as ecology <ref type="bibr">(Mazzuca, Fini et al., 2025)</ref>.</p><p>Second, our results extend previous evidence on the multifarious nature of ecological concepts <ref type="bibr">(Falcinelli et al., 2024a)</ref>, by showing that their level of abstractness can also vary depending on age. In this sense, they converge with <ref type="bibr">Barsalou et al.'s (2018)</ref> proposal that concepts should be categorized within situated situations. In this view, individuals process elements in relation to their personal characteristics, such as age, personal attitudes (section 5.4), motivations, goals, and the specific context in which they are embedded. Thus, conceptual categorization requires a flexible and dynamic mapping of meanings, which is grounded in spatio-temporal contexts and the continually evolving demographic peculiarities of individuals.</p><p>From a societal perspective, the fact that both younger and older adults conceptualize ecological issues abstractly, yet older adults represent climate change more concretely and show more positive attitudes, may have important practical implications for future action.</p><p>Campaigns and policies often focus on younger generations, but our results suggest a more nuanced, age-specific approach is needed. To engage younger people, environmental messaging could move beyond distant, abstract threats and instead highlight immediate, tangible local impacts, like air quality or local water supply, using digital platforms they already inhabit. For older adults, who already have a more concrete understanding and positive attitudes, campaigns could focus on leveraging their existing connection to the environment.</p><p>This involves emphasizing how local conservation efforts directly improve their neighborhoods or community spaces and using traditional media to reach them. Beyond campaigns, these insights can inform policy and education. For younger people, environmental education could incorporate hands-on projects, like community gardening or local clean-ups, to build a more concrete understanding. For older adults, policy can empower them as community leaders in local environmental initiatives. Ultimately, these generational differences are not a source of division but an opportunity for collaboration. By focusing on shared, local goals, we can bridge the gap between the abstract environmental concerns of the young and the lived environmental experience of the old, fostering collective action that leads to more effective and sustainable behaviors across all age groups.</p></div>

This evidence is in line with previous research showing that the semantic richness of a domain (i.e., number of information related to a concept) might influence the elaboration speed in semantic categorization tasks. Specifically, the richness of a concept's semantic representation correlates with the formation of more robust attractors within semantic space.

Next, for each correlation satisfying the criteria, we fitted a statistical model similar to the main model (section 4) but here featuring the behavioral data of interest related only to ecological concepts as a dependent variable, eliminating the Category of Word as a fixed factor, and inserting the ecology or nature related attitude of interest as a covariate. Specifically, for RTs, we performed generalized linear mixed models with a log-gamma distribution ("lme4" R's package); for ratings, we fitted ordinal regression mixed models ("ordinal" R's package); for the number of listed features, we executed generalized linear mixed models with a Poisson distribution ("lme4" R's package).</p><p>The statistical significance of interactions between the fixed factor and the covariate for all models was determined using Type III ANOVAs ("car" R's package for generalized linear mixed models; "RVAideMemoire" R's package for cumulative link mixed models), and pvalues were calculated using Wald's Chi-squared tests.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B.3. Discussion of results</head><p>Despite the relevant differences we found in ecology and nature related attitudes in older and younger adults (section 5.4), here we found that these attitudes seem to have slightly modulated performances of participants in the three tasks, with a higher impact on the rating than categorization and feature generation tasks.</p><p>To illustrate, for the categorization task, we only found a negative but weak relationship between RTs and frequency of engagement in green activities, suggesting that the more participants perceived to be frequently committed to green activities, such as gardening, the faster the processing speed of ecological concepts was. Similarly, in the feature generation task, we found two positive but weak correlations between the number of listed features and the estimated frequency of engagement in outdoor activities and the perceived level of passion towards nature, suggesting that the more participants felt to be frequently engaged in outdoor activities in nature, such as jogging, or the more they loved nature, the higher the number of features they listed for ecological concepts.</p><p>Thus, our data revealed that only nature-related attitudes correlated with performances for ecological concepts in the two tasks. These results might be explained by the fact that since ecology and nature are strictly intertwined topics, being highly devoted to nature (e.g., spending considerable time in nature, frequently engaging in green activities or, more broadly, being highly passionate to natural beings) might bring more knowledge and familiarity with climate change themes, which, in turn, might make ecological concepts easier to be processed or denser in their semantic representation. However, for both tasks, we did not find any direct effect of these attitudes on the performances shown by older and younger adults.</p><p>Interestingly, we found more numerous relationships between ecology and nature-related attitudes and rating scores, specifically those concerning Word Confidence, Familiarity, and Perceived Distance dimensions. To illustrate, we first found that the more participants perceived to be experts in ecology or nature, frequently updated on these topics, and frequently involved in ecological actions and outdoor activities in nature, the more they perceived to master ecological concepts meaning. Similarly, the more participants perceived to be experts in ecology and frequently involved in ecological activities, the more they considered ecological concepts familiar. Finally, the more participants perceived to be experts in ecology or nature, frequently involved in ecological and green activities, and passionate about nature, the more they perceived ecological concepts closely. In other words, the more participants had higher levels of interest, experience and expertise with the domain, the more ecological concepts were familiar, well-mastered and psychologically close.</p><p>Within these attitudes, only expertise on ecology showed to differently modulate ratings of older and younger individuals on Word Confidence and Perceived Distance.</p><p>In the case of Word Confidence, we found that expertise significantly impacted ratings of both age groups, but with a higher effect on older people. Indeed, at increased perceived levels of expertise in ecology, both age groups felt more confident in mastering ecological concepts' meaning, but older adults significantly more than younger adults ( Interestingly, our results also showed that the model with ecological expertise as a covariate explained data better than the main model without this attitude as a covariate, thus suggesting that expertise might be an important factor mediating the relationship between individuals and their level of confidence in mastering the meaning of a new and not still well-defined domain such as that of ecology, especially if they are older adults.</p><p>In the case of Perceived Distance, we found that expertise impacted the ratings of only older adults. Indeed, at increased levels of expertise on ecology, older adults perceived ecological concepts as increasingly psychologically closer. Conversely, for younger adults, increasing levels of expertise did not convert into an increased psychological closeness to ecological concepts <ref type="bibr">(Figure B.1,</ref><ref type="bibr">Panel B)</ref>. This data might contribute to integrate previous evidence showing a positive link between psychological closeness and willingness to act <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Leviston et al., 2014)</ref>, making us hypothesize that the relationship between psychological closeness to ecological themes and motivation to positively behave toward the environment might be influenced by the level of expertise that someone perceives on ecology. However, this complex relationship might depend on people's age. Indeed, at increasing levels of expertise in ecology, younger adults might continue to feel ecological phenomena far from them which, in turn, might not convert into actual pro-environmental behaviors. Conversely, expertise might be crucial for older adults. Indeed, it might help older adults perceive ecological phenomena closer and thus better motivate them to act eco-friendly. Hence, these results might concur to explain why younger adults, despite being, on average, more interested-that is, more informed, thus, more expert-in ecological topics, are also less willing to engage in actual pro-environmental behaviors than older adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">(Wiernik et al., 2013)</ref>.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">S2</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Appendix A. "Control" categorization task study</head><p>To be sure that results we obtained on the processing disadvantage of ecological over abstract and concrete concepts (section 5.1) could be attributed to their intrinsic nature rather than to a possible interference effect due to animal filler words-indeed, both ecological and animal are green concepts, and some ecological concepts in our wordpool implicitly referred to animals (e.g., fauna, natural reserve); thus, this might have caused an interference effect making RTs for ecological concepts shower-, and with the broader aim to provide robustness to our main findings, we conducted a further non-preregistered "control" categorization task on an independent sample of older and younger individuals. The experiment's structure, materials and methods were identical to the main study (section 3), with the only difference that in this case filler words consisted of astrological concepts (e.g., spaceship, galaxy, meteor; for an overview of the experimental stimuli, Table <ref type="table">S2</ref>, SM). We chose this category since it included words indicating non-green concepts that were not semantically related to any of our critical words (abstract, concrete, ecological). Similarly to animal concepts (section 3.2.1), we selected astrological words through consultation among ourselves.</p><p>On a procedural side, we tested three independent groups of participants (n = 4 older and n = 4 younger adults from each age group) in one of the three possible settings (section 3.3). We first asked them to provide the same socio-demographic information as at the beginning of our main experiment (section 3.3) and then to perform the "control" categorization task. Finally, participants provided information on the greenness of the places where they live and their attitudes towards ecology and nature, as in the last part of our main experiment (section 3.3).</p><p>The procedure took, on average, 20/25 minutes per participant.</p><p>Statistical analyses were the same as for the main study (section 4). Materials, raw data, and analysis scripts can be found at the OSF repository (<ref type="url" target="https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/V8XC9">https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/V8XC9</ref>).</p><p>Below, we report information on the sample, the task's results, and a brief discussion of them.</p><p>Participants. Since this study represented just a "control" follow-up, we tested half of the original sample for each experimental condition. The sample was therefore composed of 48 Results. Similarly to our main results (section 5.1), participants showed a high-even if slightly slower-level of accuracy in responses (Correct answers = 95%).</p><p>Results from the statistical model on RTs partially replicated previous findings. Indeed, we found a main effect of Category of Word, (2) = 30.3235, p &lt; .0001, and not a main effect of Setting, (2) = 5.5951, p = .061, nor a significant interaction between Group and Setting, (2) = 0.4721, p = .790. Unlike previous findings, we did not find a main effect of Group, (1) = 1.2782, p = .258.</p><p>In line with main results, participants processed ecological concepts slower than both abstract, z = 3.427, d = 0.469, p = .002, and concrete concepts, z = 6.568, d = 0.902, p &lt; .0001.</p><p>Interestingly, here we found that participants processed concrete concepts faster than abstract ones, z = 3.121, d = 0.432, p = .005.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion of results.</head><p>Results replicated the main ones on the processing disadvantage of ecological upon abstract and concrete concepts (section 5.1), thus confirming that this evidence might be likely due to ecological concepts' intrinsic nature rather than to the kind of stimuli we used as filler words (animals). Interestingly, in this case, we obtained results in line with the Concreteness Effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Paivio, 1990)</ref>, finding that concrete concepts were processed significantly faster than abstract ones for both age groups. Differences between the two tasks in the presence of such an effect might be explained by the fact that astrological entities represent a better distinct conceptual category from concrete concepts compared to animal ones (section 5.1). Indeed, animals are usually conceived as concrete concepts <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">(Keil, 1989)</ref> and people can potentially directly experience them, as is typically true for our (concrete) artifacts. Thus, their presence might have made RTs to concrete concepts slower and obscured the Concreteness Effect, differently from what not happened with astrological concepts (section 6). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Appendix B. Might attitudes toward ecology and nature have affected performances of older</head><p>and younger adults in the three tasks?</p><p>In our experiment, we collected some information on the attitudes of participants toward ecology and nature (section 3.2.3), and we found that our samples of older and younger adults a-priori differed in some of them (section 5.4). Here, we explored whether these differences have influenced performances the two age groups showed for ecological concepts in the categorization, rating, and feature generation tasks. Below, we detail analyses we performed (section B.1) along with results they yielded (section B.2) and a brief discussion of them (section B.3).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B.1. Data Analysis</head><p>To explore whether ecology and nature-related attitudes of older and younger participants might have impacted their performances for ecological concepts in the three tasks, we followed Group, (1) = 1.1862, p = .276, with Setting, (2) = 0.5091, p = .775, with Group and Setting, (</p><p>= 1.9563, p = .376.</p><p>Relationship between ecology and nature-related attitudes and ratings. We found that only Word Confidence, Familiarity, and Perceived Distance dimensions had a significant relationship with ecology and nature-related attitudes. Specifically, we found significant, positive, and weak correlations between Word Confidence and the perceived level of expertise on ecology, r s (958) = .37, p &lt; .0001, the perceived level of expertise on nature, r s (958) = .29, p &lt; .0001, the estimated frequency of updates on ecological topics, r s (958) = .27, p &lt; .0001, the estimated frequency of engagement in ecology-related activities, r s (958) = .30, p &lt; .0001, and the estimated frequency of engagement in outdoor activities, r s (958) = .23, p &lt; .0001. We also found significant, positive, and weak correlations between Familiarity and the perceived level of expertise on ecology, r s (958) = .22, p &lt; .0001, and the estimated frequency of engagement in ecology-related activities, r s (958) = .20, p &lt; .0001. Finally, we found significant, negative, and weak correlations between Perceived Distance and the perceived level of expertise on ecology, r s (958) = .23, p &lt; .0001, the perceived level of expertise on nature, r s (958) = .25, p &lt; .0001, the estimated frequency of engagement in ecology-related activities, r s (958) = .24, p &lt; .0001, the estimated frequency of engagement in green activities, r s (958) = .25, p &lt; .0001, and the perceived level of passion towards nature, r s (958) = .21, p &lt; .0001.</p><p>Despite this, the models enriched with the covariates showed no significant interaction between these characteristics and Group (Table <ref type="table">B</ref>.1), apart from the two models targeting Word</p><p>Confidence and Perceived Distance ratings as a dependent variable and the perceived level of expertise on ecology as a covariate, that showed a significant interaction between these  Table <ref type="table">S3</ref>.

Similarities and differences between older and younger adults in the knowledge related to "Recycling" -insights from the topics encompassed by their semantic networks' communities.</p><p>Older Adults' Network. The first aspect of interest in this network is the coexistence of a positive vs. negative vision of recycling. Indeed, there are two main communities positively characterizing it (light blue community: e.g., "Right"; "Beautiful". Light orange community:</p><p>"Engaging"; "Respectable") and mainly highlighting its beneficial outcomes for both people and nature (light blue community: e.g., "Saving"; "Pro-Nature". Light orange community: e.g., "Less-Waste", "Not-Polluting"). These communities oppose a more numerous sets with a predominantly negative connotation of recycling, mainly due to its complexity, lack of organization, difficulty in the implementation, inutility, waste of energy and money (purple community: e.g., "Demanding"; "Impossible". Dark orange community: e.g., "Disorganized"; "Useless"; "Expensive"; "Unclear". Red community: e.g., "Ineffective";</p><p>"Confusing") and to the illicit aspect of recycling that in Italy is usually thought to be related to mafia activities (light cherry community: e.g., "Penal"; "Multi-Managed". Dark blue community: e.g., "Of Money"; "Illicit").</p><p>Another salient topic in the older network focuses on the practical aspects of functioning and the processing technique of recycling, mostly related to giving new life to objects (petroleum community: e.g., "Recomposed"; "Regenerated"). In line with this, two other communities stress the action of reuse recycling can imply (light green community: e.g., "Recovered"; "Transformed". Dark green community: e.g., "Reused"; "Refurbished").</p><p>Finally, in this network, we also find two communities containing the kinds of entities that can be objects of recycling (light green community: e.g., "Of Clothes"; "Food". Dark blue community: e.g., "Alimentary"; "Electronic"), and a final, multi-thematic, one (i.e., dark blue community) empathizing the thematic sphere of recycling ("Ecological"; "Green"), its social value ("Social"; "Reciprocal"), and its obligatoriness ("Coercive"; "Controlled") (see Figure</p></div>
