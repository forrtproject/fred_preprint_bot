<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>BACKGROUND</head><p>Tourette syndrome (TS) is characterized by motor and vocal tics present for at least one year, whereas in chronic motor or vocal tic disorder (CTD), either motor or vocal tics, but not both, are present <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>. Although TS/CTD are childhood-onset disorders, a substantial proportion continue to experience impairing tics into adulthood, affecting around 0.05% of adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref>, typically individuals with most severe symptoms <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4)</ref>, with more psychiatric comorbidity in childhood <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>, as well with first degree relatives with psychiatric disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>. These disorders are associated with reduced quality of life <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>, lower educational attainment <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>, and an increased risk of somatic and psychiatric morbidity and mortality <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>.</p><p>The most common treatment for TS/CTD is pharmacotherapy, specifically antipsychotics, which show modest efficacy and often have side effects, including long-term metabolic problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>. Non-pharmacological treatments for TS/CTD are therefore attractive alternatives. Behaviour therapy (BT) for tics is based on the idea that, while tics have a biological origin, their expression is influenced by contextual variables. Hence, BT teaches individuals skills to better manage their tics <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref>. Although BT for TS/CTD has shown to be effective in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref> and is recommended in treatment guidelines <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20)</ref>, it is not widely available <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22)</ref>. Internet-based interventions are known to be able to bridge the accessibility gap <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref>. An RCT on self-guided Internet-delivered BT (I-BT) -specifically habit reversal training (HRT) -for adults showed a superior effect compared to placebo three months after the end of the treatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref>. Two recent largescale RCTs on therapist-guided Internet-delivered exposure and response prevention (ERP)another variation of BT -in children and adolescents showed a decrease in tic severity <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26)</ref>, and one of them showed superiority of I-BT to therapist-guided psychoeducation <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref>, making ERP the most thoroughly evaluated treatment method delivered to children and adolescents via the Internet.</p><p>Despite being the preferred treatment option for TS/CTD <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref>, BT is generally not accessible <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref> and there are no studies investigating the effects of ERP for TS/CTD in adults. The aim of the current project was to conduct a feasibility trial on therapist-guided ERP-based I-BT in adults with TS/CTD to evaluate its feasibility, acceptability, safety, preliminary efficacy, and long-term maintenance of gains.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>METHODS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Design</head><p>The study was a single-group, unmasked feasibility trial of TICNET, a therapist-supported Internet-delivered ERP-based BT for adults with TS/CTD. The trial was carried out at a psychiatric outpatient clinic specialised in obsessive-compulsive and related disorders (OCDprogrammet) at the Karolinska University Hospital in Stockholm, Sweden. The study was approved by the Swedish Ethical Review Authority (nr 2020-00479) and pre-registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04908969). The study participants and the wider public were not involved in the design of the trial. A flowchart of participant recruitment, enrolment, and follow-up is presented in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants and screening procedures</head><p>Participants were recruited nationwide through self-and clinical referrals. During recruitment, information about the study was spread to interest organisations, health centres, and psychiatric outpatient clinics, as well as through advertisement in social media and a local Stockholm newspaper. For inclusion, participants had to: a) be 18 years of age or older; b) fulfil diagnostic criteria for TS/CTD according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5); c) have a Total Tic Severity score (TTS) of &gt;15, or &gt;10 for individuals with motor or vocal tics only, in the past week, as measured by the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS); d) be able to read and communicate in Swedish; and e) have regular access to a computer connected to the Internet, sufficient technical skills to use the treatment platform, and a mobile phone to receive text messages. Exclusion criteria were: a) severe psychiatric comorbidities such as organic brain disorder, intellectual disability, psychosis, bipolar disorder, autism spectrum disorder, anorexia nervosa or substance use disorders; b) acute psychiatric problems such as severe depression or suicidal risk needing immediate psychiatric care; c) severe tics causing immediate risk to the participants or others and requiring urgent medical attention; d) previous BT or cognitive behaviour therapy for TS/CTD for a minimum of 8 sessions with a qualified therapist within 12 months prior to assessment; e) simultaneous psychological treatment for TS/CTD; or f) initiation or adjustment of medication for TS/CTD within two months prior to assessment. All participants provided written or digital informed consent.</p><p>At the recruitment stage, the self-referred participants were guided from the study website to the secure, encrypted study platform BASS4, run by the Karolinska eHealth Core Facility at Karolinska Institutet, where they were encouraged to read detailed information about the project and to apply for the study by creating a personal account and signing the informed consent. After registration, the prospective participants were contacted via telephone by study personnel and, if the participant was deemed preliminary eligible, they received access to an online questionnaire on the platform to collect demographic data and assess common psychiatric symptoms. If there was no indication of exclusion criteria at this stage, the participant was booked for a full psychiatric assessment at the clinic via videoconferencing software, including assessment of inclusion and exclusion criteria, as well as comorbidities. Clinically referred participants were asked about their willingness to participate in the study at their first psychiatric appointment at the clinic where the full psychiatric assessment was performed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Intervention</head><p>Upon enrolment in the study, each participant was assigned to a therapist (a licensed psychologist or a psychologist in training under supervision) who activated the treatment in the study platform within a week from the pre-treatment assessment.</p><p>The 10-week programme TICNET was provided via the platform BASS4 designed for Internetadministered treatments. The treatment consisted of eight chapters that contained psychoeducational text material, exercises, homework assignments, and worksheets for registering high-risk situations, premonitory urges (i.e., sensations typically preceding the expression of tics), and ERP practice. The treatment had a self-help format with participants working on the chapters online, with support from a therapist through messages in the platform. The treatment further included one scheduled phone call around the time the participant had received the rationale for the ERP and was about to start their practice, to maximize the chance for the first practice to align with the rationale. The therapists were also allowed to make additional phone calls when written problem-solving was deemed insufficient. The therapists answered questions and gave feedback on homework assignments and worksheets within 24 hours. The participants were encouraged to work with one chapter a week and the subsequent chapter was opened by the therapist as soon as the previous one was completed. During the trial, bi-weekly supervision sessions were held for the therapists with an experienced clinical psychologist specialising in TS/CTD.</p><p>The central component of the treatment was ERP. During the treatment, participants received information about tics and how to work with ERP (see Table <ref type="table">1</ref> for an overview of the treatment). Throughout the treatment, participants worked with exposing themselves to situations that triggered their premonitory urges and practiced suppressing their tics for increasingly longer periods of time. They learned different strategies to provoke their premonitory urges to make suppression of their tics more challenging and gradually increase the time they can suppress tics. A central tool in the treatment was the "Ticstimer", a worksheet where participants continuously recorded their ERP practice and the length of time they managed to suppress tics. Additionally, the treatment included an introduction to strategies such as HRT and applied relaxation, to give the participants a broad range of tools and make the treatment more flexible and therefore suitable for regular psychiatric settings. Treatment completion was defined as completing at least chapters 1-4. Table <ref type="table">1</ref>. Overview of the treatment chapters, delivered over 10 weeks. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Outcome measures and assessment points</head><p>The primary endpoint of the trial was post-treatment (i.e., 10 weeks from baseline). The feasibility, acceptability, preliminary efficacy, and preliminary maintenance of the effects of the treatment were assessed using the dimensions of the RE-AIM implementation framework (reach, preliminary efficacy, adoption, implementation, and maintenance) <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28)</ref>. Reach was measured by the percentage of eligible/excluded participants and the reasons for exclusion. Preliminary efficacy was defined as symptom change on the primary outcome measure, the YGTSS-TTS, and by other symptom-specific and non-specific measures (see below). These measures were administered at pre-and post-treatment, as well as 3, 6, and 12 months after the end of the treatment, unless specified otherwise. Adoption was measured by weekly questions about the treatment material and self-reported time spent on assignments, the number of treatment chapters completed during treatment, the score on the clinician-rated Internet Intervention Participant Adherence Scale (IIPAS; 5 items; score range between 0 and 20, with higher scores indicating higher patient adherence) <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(29)</ref> at mid-and post-treatment, the Credibility/Expectancy Questionnaire (CEQ; 5 items; score range between 0 and 50, with higher scores indicating higher credibility) <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30)</ref>, the Working Alliance Inventory Short-Revised (WAI-SR; 12 items; score range between 12 and 84, with higher scores indicating stronger perceived alliance between the patient and the therapist) (31) at week 4, and the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ-8; 8 items; score range between 8 and 32, with higher scores indicating higher treatment satisfaction) (32) at posttreatment. Implementation was measured as the average therapist time spent per participant and week, the number of messages sent and received within the platform, and the number of additional telephone calls made by therapists. Maintenance was assessed using the change in symptoms and quality of life between pre-treatment and the 3-, 6-and 12-month follow-ups.</p><p>The primary outcome measure for the preliminary efficacy was the YGTSS-TTS. The YGTSS is a clinician-administered semi-structured interview with independent ratings of motor and vocal tic severity as well as a rating of tic-related impairment <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(33)</ref>. All assessors were trained in administering the YGTSS by an experienced expert-rater by co-rating pre-recorded YGTSS administration prior to the trial. Secondary disorder-specific outcome measures were the YGTSS Impairment score, the Adult Tic Questionnaire (ATQ) (34) (also administered weekly), and the Gilles de la Tourette Syndrome Quality of Life Scale (QTS-QoL) <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(35)</ref>.</p><p>The Clinical Global Impression -Severity (CGI-S) and Clinical Global Impression -Improvement (CGI-I) <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(36)</ref> scales (clinician-rated) were used to assess overall clinical severity and improvement, respectively. In line with previous trials <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26)</ref>, CGI-I scores of "very much improved" (1) or "much improved" (2) corresponded to treatment response.</p><p>The Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(37)</ref> and the EuroQol 5-dimensions (EQ-5D) <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(38)</ref> were used to evaluate general functioning and quality of life. The Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale -Self-Rated (MADRS-S) was used to assess depressive symptoms (39) (also administered weekly).</p><p>Safety was measured at post-treatment and at the 3-month follow-up, when the participants rated a list of common adverse events and answered an open-ended question where they could report any adverse event.</p><p>Comorbidities were assessed during the pre-treatment psychiatric assessment using the MINI International Neuropsychiatric Interview <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(40)</ref> and the section for OCD and related disorders of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 (SCID) <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(41)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data analysis</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Power calculation</head><p>The power calculation was based on the only previous study testing Internet-delivered ERP for TS/CTD at the time this pilot was designed, conducted in children <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(42)</ref>. We planned to recruit 30 participants in order to detect an effect size of d=0.7 (90% power, alpha 0.05), allowing for a 20% dropout.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Outcome analyses</head><p>The analyses were conducted using the statistical software R, version 4.4.0. For the measures of reach, adoption, implementation, and safety, descriptive statistics and frequencies were calculated. For each efficacy measure (YGTSS, ATQ, GTS-QoL, MADRS-S, EQ5D, and SDS) and endpoint (post-treatment, 3-, 6-and 12-month follow-up) the symptom change was evaluated using mixed-effects linear regression models with a fixed effect of time and a random intercept specification for each individual. Also, for each measure and endpoint, within-group effect sizes were calculated using Cohen's d by dividing the mean change between pre-treatment and the respective timepoint by the standard deviation of that measure at pre-treatment. To maximize replicability and transparency, all statistical code was uploaded to a public repository (https://osf.io/pbj4x/).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Recruitment and sample description (Reach)</head><p>Out of 89 individuals who applied for the study, 73 were assessed (among those n=1 clinically referred) and 42 (58% of the assessed individuals) were excluded (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). The most common cause for exclusion was not fulfilling the diagnostic criteria for chronic tics (n=26/62% of excluded individuals), followed by having a severe psychiatric condition (n=6/14%) and low tic severity (n=5/12%). Finally, 31 participants were included in the study.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">2</ref> shows the demographic and pre-treatment characteristics for the included participants. The majority were men (n=18/58.1%) with a mean age of 41.6 years (SD=15.4) and a mean total tic severity score at pre-treatment of 19.42 (SD=5.99) on the YGTSS-TTS. Just above half of participants (n=17/54.8%) fulfilled diagnostic criteria for TS, and the rest suffered from motor CTD. Only one participant had a confirmed comorbid condition -panic disorder with agoraphobia. The most common tics at pre-treatment were concentrated around the eyes (present in n=27/ 87%), nose (n=16/52%), jaws and fingers (each present in n=15/48%), and lips, neck, and shoulders (each present in n=12/39%) </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Adoption</head><p>Out of 8 treatment chapters, participants completed 6.5 on average (SD=1.9; median=7.5). A total of 28 (90%) individuals were treatment completers (i.e., they completed the first four chapters containing the key ingredients of ERP). The mean credibility score on CEQ at midtreatment was 36.6 out of 50 possible (SD=7.6). The mean treatment satisfaction score at post-treatment was 27.1 out of 32 possible (SD=3.6). The therapists' average rating of participants' treatment adherence according to IIPAS was 14.9 (SD=4.0) at mid-treatment and 13.3 (SD=5.4) at post-treatment out of 20 possible. The average rating of the usefulness of the chapters was 4.1/5 (SD=0.4), with the first chapter providing the psychological model for tics and rationale for the treatment rated as most useful (M=4.6/5, SD=0.5) and the chapters on HRT as least useful (M=3.5/5, SD=1.4).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Preliminary efficacy at post-treatment</head><p>Within-group changes in the tic-specific measures are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">3</ref>. The pre-to-posttreatment change on the primary outcome measure, the YGTSS-TTS, was statistically significant (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref>, top panel). The within-group effect sizes were in the moderate range (Cohen's d=0.49). Changes in the YGTSS Impairment score, the ATQ (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref>, bottom panel), and the GTS-QoL followed a similar pattern. At post-treatment, 14 (45%) of the participants were classified as responders, according to the CGI-I.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Maintenance of gains during the follow-up</head><p>YGTSS-TTS scores continued to improve throughout the follow-up (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">3</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref>, top panel). At the 3-month follow-up, 14 (45%) participants were responders. At the 6-and 12month follow-ups, 13 (42%) participants were classified as responders.   Pre -pre-treatment; Post -post-treatment; W1-W8 -weekly measurements week 1-8; Fu3 -3-month follow-up; Fu6 -6-month follow-up; Fu12 -12-month follow-up.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Implementation</head><p>The average time spent by the therapists on each participant per week was 18.1 minutes (SD=9.7 minutes). A total of 11 participants (35%) received additional telephone calls during the treatment, with a median of 1 call per participant. On average, 15.0 messages (SD=11.2) were sent by the therapists to each participant during the course of the treatment. The participant rating of working alliance according to the WAI was 70.4 (SD=12.2) out of 72 possible. The participant average weekly self-reported time spent working with the treatment was 197 minutes (SD=129). In the free text answers, most of the participants found the treatment helpful, mentioned reduced shame and reduced feeling of being alone with their struggles, and were satisfied with the Internet-based format. The participants mentioned integrating the practice into their everyday life. Among the difficulties, the participants mentioned the challenges of combining the treatment with the stresses of the everyday life and challenges with understanding the structure of working materials and when navigating the treatment platform.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Safety</head><p>No serious adverse events were reported during the treatment or the follow-up period. The most common adverse events reported by the participants were fatigue, experienced often or all the time by 11 participants (35%), sleep disturbance (n=6; 19%), worry/anxiety (n=4; 13%), and feeling low (n=4; 13%). At the 3-month follow-up, the participants reported fewer adverse events, with fatigue and worsened tic symptoms being the most common (each reported by 6 participants; 19%).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p>The aim of this uncontrolled trial was to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, safety, preliminary efficacy, and preliminary maintenance of TICNET, an online, therapist-guided ERP-based behavioural intervention for adults with TS/CTD. Overall, the intervention was feasible, acceptable, safe, and potentially efficacious, with reductions in tic severity being maintained for at least 12 months after treatment.</p><p>Out of the 73 screened participants, 42% were included in the study. Although the reach was lower than in a RCT for a face-to-face treatment (71%) <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref>, it exceeded the proportion of enrolled participants in two recent RCTs for guided Internet-delivered treatments for children and adolescents by Hollis at al. (50%) <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref> and Andrén et al. (34%) <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref>. The two latter studies and the current study allowed participant self-referral, which is essential to achieve the high treatment accessibility, one of the greatest advantages of Internetdelivered treatments. Allowing participant self-referrals and advertising is likely to lead to higher proportions of non-eligible individuals. Most individuals with TS/CTD were included in the trial -only a small proportion was excluded due to severe comorbidities or mild tic severity -indicating that the treatment reached a relevant population. However, it is important to note that only one included participant had a current comorbid psychiatric disorder, which is highly unusual in this patient group. Thus, the Internet treatment format seems to have attracted a particular sub-population of individuals with chronic tics, which differs from most samples seen in specialist TS/CTD clinics.</p><p>The overall adoption of the treatment was good. Most participants completed almost all treatment chapters and 90% were considered treatment completers. In a recent RCT of treatment for adults, 33% of participants in the three randomization arms (face-to-face BT, unguided Internet-based BT, and placebo) were considered non-compliant <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref>. Despite the differences in defining compliance, our results indicate treatment compliance that was at least as good as what has been previously reported. Andrén et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref> reported similar compliance in their trial for I-BT children and adolescents, with the participants in the ERP group having completed 8.9 treatment chapters out of 10. Moreover, the participant adherence to the treatment in our study was in the same range as the values reported in Andrén et al: IIPAS at mid-treatment was 14.9 (compared to previously reported 14.1) and at post-treatment 13.3 (compared to 12.6). The treatment satisfaction (CSQ-8 score of 27.1) was similar to the one reported in a recent study on guided ICBT for OCD and body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) implemented in regular care (26.5 and 25.2, respectively) <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(43)</ref>.</p><p>The change in the YGTSS-TTS between pre-and post-treatment (primary endpoint) was statistically significant and the effect-size was in the medium range, but with a wide confidence interval, reaching below zero on the lower end (Cohen's d 0.49; 95% CI -0.46 to 1.44). The 2.9-raw point drop in the YGTSS-TTS was comparable to that reported in a recent RCT on HRT for adults with TS/CTD (a drop of about 2.3 in both the Internet-delivered and the face-to-face arm at post-treatment; the numbers are not reported explicitly, but derived from inspecting Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> in the publication) <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref>. A recent telehealth study on HRT saw a YGTSS-drop of 4.5 in the sample of ten adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(44)</ref>. A face-to-face study from 2012 reported a larger decrease of 6.2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref>, similar to the values of 6.1 (25) and 4.5 <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref> found in two recent RCTs on Internet-delivered ERP for children and adolescents. In our study, the drop in YGTSS-TTS increased at each follow-up point, reaching 6.5 points and an effect size of 1.09 (95% CI 0.14-2.04) 12 months after the end of the treatment. The lower decrease in tic severity than in other studies might be partly explained by the lower pre-treatment tic severity: the participants in our study started with less severe tics and improved to 16.5 on YGTSS-TTS, which is similar to previously reported 17.8 (16) and 16.2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref>. TS/CTD is a neurological condition, and the effect of behavioural techniques can be limited when addressing the milder tics still present after the treatment (especially during the relatively short treatment timeframe). Overall, in comparison with previous studies, the observed decrease in tic severity indicates that the treatment has the potential to bring relief to adults with TS/CTD who wish to have specialist treatment but have difficulties accessing it. The efficacy of the intervention should now be evaluated in an RCT, potentially recruiting more widely from clinical services to ensure a better representation of all people with TS/CTD. The therapist time of 18.1 minutes per participant per week was similar to the 19.1 minutes reported in Andrén at al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref>. The study on effectiveness of ICBT for OCD and BDD conducted at our clinic reported less time spent on participant per week (9.2 and 7.2 minutes, respectively), which can partly be explained by the fact that the OCD and BDD treatments were already implemented in regular care after having been a part of an RCT conducted at the same clinic, and the clinicians were more familiar with the treatments. In our study, the time spent on each participant per week was still much lower than in face-toface CBT, typically requiring weekly sessions of 45 to 90 minutes, suggesting that this Internet-delivered treatment can be cost-effective. The working alliance, according to the WAI, was excellent. All in all, the adoption of the treatment by the clinic's personnel in the framework of our study was successful and only required smaller adjustments of routine procedures.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations</head><p>The results require cautious interpretation given the study's limitations. This small-scale uncontrolled trial only gives an indication of the treatments' potential effects. To evaluate the treatment's efficacy, a well-powered RCT with an active comparator needs to be conducted. Also, the assessors were not blinded to the treatment that the participants received and were often treating clinician, introducing a potential bias in the assessments. The study's sample was very unusual with mild tic severity at baseline and almost no psychiatric comorbidities. Another limitation was that, although the study assessed common comorbidities at baseline, the presence of ADHD could not be assessed as this would require extensive procedures, and the project did not collect information about whether participants had previously been diagnosed with ADHD. The prevalence of ADHD -a condition that is very common in TS/CTD patients -in our sample is therefore unknown. Even with this limitation in mind, the absence of typical comorbidities, such as OCD and other prevalent disorders within this group indicates that future trials need to focus on recruiting more representative samples in order to ensure the generalizability of the results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>Therapist-guided Internet-delivered ERP-based BT for adults with TS/CTD is feasible, acceptable, safe, and potentially leads to a meaningful and durable reductions in tic severity and functioning, at least in individuals with mild symptoms and limited comorbidities. The intervention should be further evaluated in a well-powered RCT with an active comparator while ensuring the recruitment of more representative samples.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
