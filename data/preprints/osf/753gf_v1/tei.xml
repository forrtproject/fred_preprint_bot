<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The competitiveness of financed intermediaries cannot be based exclusively on financial sustainability, i.e. the ability to create profit, but it is also necessary to acquire a transversal vision of sustainability focused on the three ESG dimensions. The paper intends to propose a reflection on the main impacts of the integration of ESG factors on business decisionmaking and operational processes in the financial sector. In this context, we try to understand what role FinTech can play in favor of greater sustainability. Furthermore, through an empirical analysis, some determinants relating to social, environmental, and governance issues are identified which influence the volume of financial resources moved in the factoring market at a European level. Machine learning models are also proposed to estimate the volume</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Trough this paper we intends to answer the following research questions:</p><p>1. How important can the adoption of the ESG approach be for greater sustainability of the factoring supply chain? 2. Can greater integration with FinTech make factoring more competitive in Europe compared to the traditional banking channel?</p><p>To answer the aforementioned questions, within the structure of the paper, we are proceeding with three subsequent steps. The first intends to offer a description of the main theories that interpret ESG issues as strategic components of long-term success. In particular, in this section, we intend to describe the impacts of the integration of ESG profiles on the choices of operators in the factoring supply chain in terms of their organization, compliance, environmental and social aspects, personnel management, focus on business segments, and management practices. risk management. Concerning the second research question, factoring operators could benefit from an easier way of accessing financing as well as higher rates favorable through diversification: using, for example, forms of bank lending that exploit synergies with Fintech, as well as the issuing of bonds linked to sustainability objectives. These instruments make it possible to obtain potentially favorable conditions in terms of prices and resulting issuance costs. The second step is closely related to the previous one and has an empirical nature using the World Bank database relating to environmental, Social, and Governance data for European countries in the period between 2016 and 2022. In particular, econometric models will be proposed to estimate the impact of the E, S, and G components on the Total Factoring Volume (TFV) together with clustering and predictions with machine learning algorithms. Specifically, four different types of econometric approaches namely: Pooled Ordinary Least Squares OLS, WLS Weighted Least Squares, LAD Minimum Absolute Deviations, and Quantile Estimates. Specifically, we estimated three different equations thus considering the impact of the TFV within the E-Environment component of the ESG model, within the S-Social component, and the G-Governance component. The third step concludes.</p></div>

Their research suggests that adopting sustainable practices and green Fintech solutions can lead to improved business performance by enhancing efficiency, reducing risks, and increasing competitiveness. The authors argue that the financial sector can benefit significantly from integrating green technologies and sustainable practices, which not only improve environmental outcomes but also drive financial performance.</p><p>The impacts of ESG: the bank's point of view</p><p>The relationship between ESG factors and financial performance in banks is a complex topic explored by numerous studies. El Khoury et al. ( <ref type="formula">2023</ref>) investigate the ESG-financial performance linkage in the MENAT region, revealing a concavity-convexity pattern. They found that ESG investments improve financial performance to a point, after which the benefits diminish. The governance pillar showed a concave relationship with accounting performance, while the environmental pillar had a convex relationship with market returns, emphasizing the need for banks to optimize their ESG investments for efficient returns. Agnese and Giacomini (2023) explore the impact of ESG factors on bank funding costs. They find that banks with higher ESG ratings tend to benefit from lower funding costs. This correlation is attributed to the enhanced trust and reduced risk perceived by investors and creditors in banks that prioritize sustainable and responsible practices. The findings suggest that integrating ESG considerations into banking operations can lead to significant financial advantages by lowering the cost of capital. Gutiérrez-Ponce and Wibowo ( <ref type="formula">2024</ref>) analyze the contribution of sustainability practices to the financial performance of banks in Southeast Asia. Their research demonstrates that banks engaging in comprehensive sustainability practices tend to exhibit better financial performance. This improvement is driven by enhanced operational efficiency, stronger stakeholder relationships, and a better risk management framework. The study highlights the financial benefits of adopting sustainability practices in a region where economic and environmental challenges are particularly pronounced. <ref type="bibr">Trinh et al. (2023)</ref> investigate the relationship between social capital, trust, and bank tail risk, focusing on the role of ESG ratings and the impact of crisis shocks. Their study finds that banks with higher ESG ratings tend to have lower tail risk, particularly during times of crisis. This suggests that strong ESG practices can enhance social capital and trust, providing a buffer against extreme negative outcomes. The research underscores the importance of ESG integration in mitigating risk and enhancing the resilience of banks in the face of economic shocks. <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Cicchiello et al. (2023)</ref> examine the effect of competition on ESG controversies within the banking industry. They find that increased competition among banks can lead to a higher incidence of ESG controversies. This is likely due to the pressure to cut corners and reduce costs in a highly competitive environment, which can lead to lapses in ESG standards. The study highlights the need for regulatory oversight and strong internal controls to ensure that competitive pressures do not undermine ESG commitments. <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Shin (2021)</ref> investigates the relationship between corporate ESG profiles, matching, and the cost of bank loans. The research reveals that banks providing loans to companies with high ESG profiles tend to incur lower lending costs. This reduction in costs is attributed to the lower risk associated with firms that adhere to strong ESG practices, which can lead to more favorable lending terms and reduced default rates. The study suggests that aligning bank loan portfolios with ESG principles can be financially advantageous for both banks and their clients. <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Danisman and Tarazi (2024)</ref> explore the role of ESG activity on bank lending during financial crises. They find that banks with strong ESG practices tend to maintain more stable lending practices during financial turmoil. This stability is attributed to the robust risk management frameworks and enhanced stakeholder trust associated with high ESG standards. The study underscores the importance of ESG integration in promoting financial stability and resilience, particularly in times of economic uncertainty. <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Miranda et al. (2023)</ref> examine the impact of board characteristics and social trust on ESG performance in the European banking sector. Their research indicates that diverse and well-composed boards, characterized by a mix of skills, experiences, and gender diversity, positively influence ESG performance. Additionally, high levels of social trust within the community further enhance banks' commitment to ESG principles. The study highlights the critical role of governance structures and social capital in driving sustainable practices within banks. Lamanda and Tamásné Vőneki (2024) investigate whether ESG disclosure is associated with bank performance in the Visegrad Four countries (Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia). Their study finds a positive association between comprehensive ESG disclosure and bank performance. The research suggests that transparent ESG reporting enhances investor confidence and stakeholder engagement, leading to better financial outcomes. This finding underscores the importance of transparency in ESG practices for achieving superior financial performance. Specifically, the variables applied to estimate the value of TFV are synthetized in the Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">1</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SOURCE: Elaboration by authors</head><p>We find that the level of TFV is positively associated to:  GI: is a variable that measures the extent to which the distribution of income or consumption among individuals or households within an economy deviates from a perfectly equal distribution. A Gini index of 0 represents perfect equality, while an index of 100 implies perfect inequality. There is a positive relationship between the value of the Gini index and the value of TFV.  RTF: is the proportion of the population ages 15 and older that is economically active: all people who supply labor for the production of goods and services during a specified period. Ratio of female to male labor force participation rate is calculated by dividing female labor force participation rate by male labor force participation rate and multiplying by 100. There is a positive relationship between RTF and the value of TFV. The European nations in which the value of RTF is growing are also characterized by a growth in the value of TFV.  PA65: represents the population ages 65 and above as a percentage of the total population.</p><p>Population is based on the de facto definition of population, which counts all residents regardless of legal status or citizenship. There is a positive relationship between TFV and PA65 value. European countries with a high level of PA65 also have high levels of TFV.  ACF: represents the access to clean fuels and technologies for cooking is the proportion of total population primarily using clean cooking fuels and technologies for cooking. Under WHO guidelines, kerosene is excluded from clean cooking fuels. There is a positive relationship between the ACF value and the TFV value. The European nations where the value of ACF is growing are also characterized by a growing value in terms of TFV.  PD: is midyear population divided by land area in square kilometers. Population is based on the de facto definition of population, which counts all residents regardless of legal status or citizenship-except for refugees not permanently settled in the country of asylum, who are generally considered part of the population of their country of origin. In most cases the definition of inland water bodies includes major rivers and lakes. There is a positive relationship between the PD value and the TFV value. Regions in which the PD value tends to be high also have high TFV values.</p><p>A synthesis of the econometric results is showed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">2</ref>. Results show that the level of TFV is negatively associated to:  CDD: is a measure of how hot the temperature was on a given day or during a period of days. There is a negative relationship between the value of CDD and the value of TFV.</p><p>European nations in which the value of CDD tends to increase have decreasing values in terms of TFV.  PUS: represents the population using an improved sanitation facility that is not shared with other households and where excreta are safely disposed of in situ or treated off site. Improved sanitation facilities include flush/pour flush to piped sewer systems. Septic tanks or pit latrines; pit latrines with slabs (including ventilated pit latrines), and composting toilets. There is a negative relationship between the PUS value and the TFV value. The European nations in which the PUS value tends to increase are also characterized by a decreasing TFV value.  EIL: is the energy intensity level of primary energy is the ratio between energy supply and gross domestic product measured at purchasing power parity. Energy intensity is an indication of how much energy is used to produce one unit of economic output. Lower ratio indicates that less energy is used to produce one unit of output. There is a negative relationship between the value of TFV and the value of EIL. European nations characterized by increasing levels of EIL have decreasing values in terms of TFV.  SE: is the gender parity index for gross enrolment ratio in primary and secondary education is the ratio of girls to boys enrolled at primary and secondary levels in public and private schools. There is a negative relationship between the value of SE and the value of TFV. The European nations in which the value of SE grows are characterized by a declining trend in the value of TFV.</p><p>Therefore, we can verify that overall the value of the aggregate impact of the ESG variables is negatively correlated with the value of TFV. However, if we reflect on the individual components we can notice that the E and G components are negatively connected to the value of TFV while the S component is positively connected to the value of TFV. We also note that the variables that have the greatest negative impact in terms of TFV are EIL and SE. Therefore, we can conclude that in an aggregate sense the value of TFV tends to grow as the aggregate value of ESG, calculated according to the variables indicated, decreases. The data shows the presence of two clusters:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Clusterization with k-Means</head><p>• Cluster 1: Greece, Hungary, Czech Republic, Denmark, Poland, Ukraine, Spain, Switzerland, Estonia, Bulgaria, Lithuania, Cyprus, Netherlands, Slovenia, Moldova, Austria, Croatia, Finland, Ireland, Romania, Slovakia, Serbia, Portugal , Belgium, Georgia, Norway. • Cluster 2: Latvia, Malta; • Cluster 3: France, United Kingdom, Luxembourg, Turkey, Germany, Italy, Sweden.</p><p>Considering the average of the clusters by TFV value we can note the following ordering: Cluster 2&gt;Cluster 3&gt;Cluster 1 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SOURCE: Elaboration by authors</head><p>We can therefore note that the diffusion of factoring is maximum in Latvia and Malta, two countries which alone constitute a single cluster and which they certainly are outliers. The countries of Cluster 3 follow. Cluster 3 is made up of a number of very heterogeneous countries from both a socio-economic and institutional point of view. In fact, on the one hand, there are countries with a medium-high per capita income such as France, the United Kingdom, Luxembourg, Germany and Sweden, and on the other hand, there are countries with a mediumlow per capita income such as Italy and Turkey. Finally, there is the third cluster presence of TFV. This is a cluster made up of 27 very heterogeneous countries which however share low levels in terms of TFV. Specifically, we can note that the level of TFV tends to be medium-high in only 11 of the countries analyzed. Furthermore, it is not possible to identify strictly financial criteria for clustering. In fact, even highly developed countries from a financial point of view, such as the Netherlands and Switzerland, are present in the least performing cluster in terms of TFV. On the other hand, countries that have a basically traditionalist financial culture such as Italy and Turkey tend to have medium-high TFV levels. It follows that the choice to open a national economic system to growth or a reduction in terms of TFV tends to be connected to reasons detectable at country level which cannot be generalised. However, in a general sense, it is possible to state that, with the growth of per capita income, the distribution of the TFV value also tends to grow even if there are exceptions such as for example in the case of Ireland, the Netherlands and Switzerland. Furthermore, if we consider the 2022 ranking we can see that in first place is Latvia with a TFV value of 920 units, followed by Malta with an amount of 696 units and the United Kingdom with 592 units. In the middle of the table are Spain with a value of 37.39 units, followed by Austria with 35.88, and Ireland with 28.62 units. Slovenia closes the ranking with an amount of 2.91 units, followed by the Netherlands with an amount of 2.53 units and Croatia with an amount of 1.37 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref>). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SOURCE: Elaboration by authors</head><p>If we instead consider the European countries by value of the percentage change in the TFV value, we can note that in general the countries that have had low levels of TFV are also the countries that have grown the most. In particular, Georgia is the country that grew the most between 2016 and 2022 with a value equal to 1664.29% going from an amount of 14.00 units up to a value of 247 units. Poland follows with a growth of 428% from 1.55 units in 2016 up to a value of 8.19 units in 2022. In third place is Bulgaria with a variation of +290.29% corresponding to a variation from an amount of 1.95 units up to a value of 7.60 units. In the middle of the table are Austria with +82.9%, Lithuania with +77.42%, and Slovenia with +77.04%. The Netherlands closes the ranking with -6.50%, followed by Croatia with -51.68% and Moldova with -70.59%. Overall, between 2016 and 2022 the average value of the TFV in the European nations considered grew by 55.30% going from an amount of 98.35 units in 2016 up to an amount of 152.74 units in 2022. Therefore, we can conclude that despite the generalized growth of the TFV value in the European nations considered between 2016 and 2022, there is still a significant distinction at the country level. First of all, an exception must be made for Malta and Latvia. In fact, the two small countries have very high TFV levels. This condition could be due to financial choices and international interests located at a national level. Secondly, we note that large European countries tend to have high TFV levels. However, most European countries have a medium-low level of TFV including some high per capita income countries such as the Netherlands. Therefore, the choice to create markets at country level for factoring seems to be connected to contingent motivations of individual nations. In addition, even in the general growth of the level of TFV, many countries in Europe demonstrate low levels of the observed variable.</p></div>

A comparison between eight different machine learning algorithms is then proposed. Machine learning algorithms are trained with 70% of the data. The remaining 30% of the data is used for prediction. The ordering of the algorithms is made up by maximizing the R-Squared and minimizing the statistical errors MAE-Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error-MSE, and Root Mean Squared Error-RMSE. The following indicators were therefore used:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0"> R Squared= 𝑅 = 1 - = 1 - ∑( ) ∑( )  Mean Average Error= 𝑀𝐴𝐸 = ∑ | |  Mean Squared Error=𝑀𝑆𝐸= ∑ (𝑦 -𝑦 )  Root Mean Squared Error=𝑅𝑀𝑆𝐸= ∑ ( 𝑦 -𝑦 )^2</formula><p>where 𝒚 𝒊 is the true value, 𝒚 =predicted value, and 𝒚 = ∑ 𝒚 𝒏 , n=sample size.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">CONCLUSIONS</head><p>The literature review highlights that to build truly inclusive financial systems it is increasingly necessary to promote close links between the world of digital finance and ESG issues. Otherwise, for example, if credit institutions in their business models continue to consider the problem of reducing financial exclusion as a target to be achieved rather than an input throughout their entire supply chain, they appear increasingly distant from taking on a social role with important repercussions on the territories. The lack of integration of ESG factors in the credit chain hinders the role of finance as a facilitator of the 17 sustainable development goals of Agenda 2030 and therefore a greater interaction between economic growth and social growth processes.</p><p>The econometric results show that the TFV value tends to be positively associated with the S-Social variable and negatively associated with the E-Environmental, and G-Governance component of the ESG model. From the point of view of clustering analysis, the presence of three clusters is highlighted. A particular exception must be recognized in Malta and Lithuania, which together constitute the dominant cluster. However, the adoption of factoring appears to be independent of the degree of financial culture found at country level. In fact, some countries that also have high levels of financial culture, such as the Netherlands, Switzerland and Ireland, have a medium-low degree of TFV. The large European countries, namely France, Germany, Italy, and also Turkey, are instead in an intermediate position. However, in the period considered, i.e. between 2016 and 2022, the value of TFV grew in almost all European countries. Finally, machine learning analysis predicts growth in the value of TFV in the future. It is very likely that the adoption of TFV models is more widespread in countries where the level of repayment of bank loans tends to be lower. That is, it is likely that in countries where debtors tend to be more timely in repaying debts, the level of TFV is lower. It is therefore necessary to further investigate the diffusion of the TFV level by also taking into consideration variables that consider the capacity of debtors to be more compliant with the obligations undertaken at country level.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Algorithm Optimized with the Silhouette Coefficient for Verifying the Existence of Groupings among European Countries in terms of TFV Below we present a clustering with k-Means algorithm optimized with the Silhouette coefficient.</figDesc></figure>

The research indicates that banks with strong ESG commitments are better positioned to manage risks and sustain long-term financial health, thereby supporting the overall stability of the financial system. This study underscores the critical role of ESG in maintaining the stability and resilience of the banking sector in Europe.Kalfaoglou (2021)  addresses the emergence of ESG risks as a significant new source of challenges for the banking sector. The study highlights how ESG factors, including climate change, social responsibility, and governance issues, pose potential risks to banks' operational and financial stability. The research emphasizes that banks need to develop robust risk management frameworks to mitigate these ESG-related risks, which can impact creditworthiness, regulatory compliance, and overall market perception. This underscores the necessity for banks to integrate ESG risk assessments into their strategic planning and operational processes.<ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Mallek et al. (2024)</ref> delve into the nuanced behavior of ESG returns in the context of large banks in the MENA region. Their study investigates the puzzling convex and concave patterns observed in ESG returns. The research finds that these patterns are influenced by various market and regulatory dynamics unique to the MENA region. The study highlights the complexity of ESG investments, noting that while ESG practices can lead to enhanced returns under certain conditions, they may also introduce volatility and unexpected performance patterns. This complexity underscores the importance of context-specific analysis when evaluating ESG investments in different regions.<ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Gai et al. (2023)</ref> present a new scoring model for banks' ESG disclosure. The research proposes a comprehensive framework for assessing the quality and transparency of ESG disclosures by banks. This scoring model aims to standardize ESG reporting, making it easier for stakeholders to compare and evaluate banks' ESG performance. The study underscores the critical role of transparent and accurate ESG disclosures in enhancing trust and accountability in the banking sector. By improving disclosure practices, banks can better communicate their ESG efforts and risks to investors, regulators, and the public, thereby supporting informed decision-making and promoting sustainability within the financial industry.</figDesc><table /><note><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>(2021) discuss whether banks follow market trends or regulatory requirements regarding ESG drivers.

(2021)</ref> </p>explore this relationship in the context of emerging economies, demonstrating that banks engaged in robust ESG activities tend to perform better financially. Their study presents international evidence that underscores the positive correlation between ESG efforts and enhanced banking performance. This finding is significant as it highlights the potential for ESG activities to contribute to financial stability and growth in developing markets, where economic and regulatory conditions may differ considerably from those in more developed regions. Similarly, (2023) examine the link between ESG and systemic risk in the banking sector. Their study demonstrates that banks with better ESG performance are less likely to contribute to systemic risk. This finding is particularly important in the context of financial stability, as it suggests that promoting ESG practices within banks can lead to a more stable and resilient financial system overall. ESG disclosure in the European banking sector. Their research finds that increased female representation on bank boards is positively correlated with more comprehensive ESG disclosures, particularly in environmental and social dimensions. This finding underscores the value of gender diversity in enhancing transparency and accountability in ESG reporting, suggesting that diverse leadership can drive better ESG performance</p><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Gurol &amp; Lagasio, 2022)</ref></p>.

The findings indicate that supportive institutional frameworks and regulatory environments are crucial for effective ESG accounting and reporting. The research emphasizes that robust institutional support can facilitate better ESG integration, leading to improved financial and non-financial outcomes for banks in West Africa.Below we present an econometric analysis aimed at estimating the impact of ESG factors on the Total Factoring Value-TFV variable calculated at a European level. ESG data was acquired from the World Bank database. The European countries analyzed are 36 1 . The observation period is between 2016 and 2022. The econometric models used are indicated below: Pooled Ordinary Least Squares-POLS, Weighted Least Squares-WLS, Quantile Estimation-QE.
