<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Despite the growing recognition of the mental health crisis among adolescents in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs), there remains insufficient reliable data on youth mental health challenges in Kenya and other LMICs. This dataset presents one of the most comprehensive mental health data from N=17,089 adolescents collected in 2023 across 63 public secondary schools in four counties in Kenya. Data were collected through selfreport paper-based questionnaires and include depression and anxiety symptoms as well as twelve other psychosocial measures capturing adverse childhood experiences, digital stressors, family and emerging stressors, and help-seeking behaviors. Additionally, the dataset includes comprehensive socio-demographic data. The dataset addresses a significant gap in contextually representative data on adolescent mental health as well as possible protective and risk factors and provides useful insights in the experience of depression and anxiety among Kenyan adolescents. The dataset supports psychometric validation of widely used mental health instruments in sub-Saharan African contexts and offers valuable resources for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers working on adolescent mental health interventions and policy development.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p>Mental health disorders among adolescents represent a critical global public health challenge, with particularly severe impacts in low-and middle-income countries where treatment resources remain scarce <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. In Kenya, studies suggest that up to 37% of adolescents experience depression symptoms, yet comprehensive data on youth mental health challenges remain limited <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. The establishment of a national taskforce in 2019 <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> highlighted the urgent need for large-scale surveys to inform resource allocation and intervention planning, but few subsequent comprehensive studies have been conducted.</p><p>Kenyan adolescents face unique psychosocial challenges including poverty, educational pressures, family disruption, exposure to violence, and emerging stressors such as climate change and digital technology impacts[4]. Traditional Western-developed mental health assessments may not adequately capture culturally specific expressions of distress, necessitating validation of both international and culturally adapted instruments in sub-Saharan African contexts. This dataset was compiled as part of a larger research initiative evaluating scalable mental health interventions, funded by the Fund for Innovation in Development. The data collection was designed to provide comprehensive insights into mental health and psychosocial characteristics of Kenyan adolescents to support evidence-based intervention design, assessment tool validation, and policy formulation in low-resource school settings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Description</head><p>The dataset contains comprehensive mental health and sociodemographic data from 17,089 Kenyan adolescents collected through six survey versions (Survey A-F) administered across sixty-three public secondary schools in four counties. Each survey version includes core depression and anxiety measures alongside specific additional scales to reduce participant burden while maintaining comprehensive coverage.</p><p>The data files <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> contain an R script called Analysis Script.R which outlines the analysis done on the merged dataset from all the six surveys. Codebooks and Documentations are second in the folder, containing codebooks for each of the surveys in portable document format (.pdf). The last file contains the Data in comma separated value (.csv) format, including the merged dataset containing all the six survey data, as well as individual csv files for each of the surveys. Table <ref type="table">2</ref> shows the distribution of participants across the six surveys.</p><p>The merged dataset contains sets of measures that capture multiple dimensions of adolescent mental health and wellbeing. Depression symptoms are assessed using eight items from the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-1 to PHQ-8), while anxiety is measured through seven items from the Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-1 to GAD-7).</p><p>Behavioral challenges are screened using ten items from the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ-1 to SDQ-10), and childhood trauma is captured through twenty items from the Childhood Trauma Screener (CATS-1 to CATS-20). The dataset further includes ten items on experiences of bullying (BL-1 to BL-10), ten items on adverse childhood experiences (ACES-1 to ACES-10), and fifteen items assessing aspirations (AI-1 to AI-15). Perceived social support is measured using four items from the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS-1 to MSPSS-4), while financial stress is captured by four items (FSS-1 to FSS-4). Stressors related to climate change and the COVID-19 pandemic are assessed through ten (CCAS-1 to CCAS-10) and eleven items (CSS-1 to CSS-11), respectively. Social media use is evaluated using items from the Media and Eating Image Scale (MEIS) and the Body Esteem Scale for Adolescents (BESSA), focusing on body comparison and body esteem, while problematic social media use is measured through nine items from the Social Media Disorder Scale (SMD-1 to SMD-9). Additional domains include exposure to political violence (EPV-1 to EPV-7), supplementary depression and anxiety screening items (NOK), help-seeking behaviors (NFOH), and help-seeking barriers (HSB). The codebooks provided can be referenced for additional clarification.</p><p>Table <ref type="table">1</ref> provides sample characteristics, with the following variables:</p><p>-Age: Refers to the age distribution of the students within the recruited schools. The mean age was 15.89 years (SD=1.41), with most students aged between 11 and 24 years.</p><p>-Gender: Refers to the gender of the students. Female students made up majority of the sample (53.6%).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental Design, Materials and Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Setting and Recruitment</head><p>Study participants (n = 17,089) were recruited from 63 public secondary schools across four counties in Kenya: Nairobi, Kiambu, Machakos and Makueni. The recruitment and selection capture the diversity of the Kenyan educational system, as classified by the Ministry of Education [6], ensuring that the sample reflects the varied educational environments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedures</head><p>Data collection occurred as an after-school activity in small groups of 10-15 students supervised by a trained group leader. The group leader was available to support in case participants have clarifications regarding any item on the questionnaire. Each participant completed the questionnaire individually and handed it to the group leader. The study team then collected all complete questionnaires and processed them.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Survey design and instruments used.</head><p>The measures used in this study are described below and specific questions for each measure can be found in the Supplementary Materials. The survey employed a six-survey design where participants completed one of six questionnaire batteries.</p><p>Core measures were depression and anxiety symptoms which were administered to all students:</p><p>• Depression was measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire -8 (PHQ-8), an 8item validated tool used to assess the severity of depressive symptoms. It omits the item on suicidality from the PHQ-9 and has been widely validated for use among adolescent populations <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[7]</ref>.</p><p>• Anxiety was measured by The Generalized Anxiety Disorder Screener -7 (GAD-7) is a 7-item self-report scale used to screen for symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder. It has been validated for use among adolescents in various contexts, including Kenya and demonstrated strong internal consistency and convergent validity <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[8]</ref>.</p><p>Additional measures were distributed across version based on thematic relevance as described below:</p><p>Survey A: Trauma and behavioral problems.</p><p>This survey contained measures assessing behavioral problems and exposure to trauma.</p><p>The following measures were used:</p><p>a. The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) -a behavioral screening tool for children and adolescents. This study used the 5-item conduct and 5-item hyperactivity subscales. The scale has been validated across diverse settings with adequate internal consistency <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[9]</ref>. b. The Child and Adolescent Trauma Screen (CATS) -a validated instrument used to assess exposure to potentially traumatic events and post-traumatic stress disorder among children and adolescents. This study included items on trauma exposure and excluded impairment questions <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[10]</ref>.</p><p>Survey B: Bullying and adverse childhood experiences.</p><p>This survey assessed the level and experiences of bullying as well as the exposure to childhood adversity. The instruments used are as follows:</p><p>a. A Bullying Questionnaire (BL) developed by researchers using items adapted from previously validated instruments assessing peer victimization and bullying behaviors. It captures both victim and perpetrator experiences across vernal, physical, and relational domains <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">8)</ref>.</p><p>b. The Adverse Childhood Experiences Scale (ACES) -a 10-item widely used tool for measuring exposure to various forms of childhood adversity, including abuse, neglect and household dysfunction <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[13]</ref>.</p><p>Survey C: Social support and financial strain.</p><p>This survey captures the levels of perceived social support and the relationship with financial stress and aspirations. The survey included the following measures:</p><p>a. The Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS) -a validated selfreporting tool for assessing perceived social support from friends, family and significant others using the family subscale. The tool has been approved for use among young individuals, such as adolescents and young adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[14]</ref>. b. Aspirations Index (AI) -A 15-item measurement scale used to assess participants' life aspirations based on the perceived relevance of their future goals. The scale has been approved for use in diverse environments and has displayed internal consistency <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">16]</ref>. c. The Financial Stress Scale (FSS) -A 4-item measurement scale used to access financial stress levels among participants. The scale has shown internal consistency and has been approved for use in various contexts. This survey looked at the usage of social media and the stress caused by exposure to political violence and unrest, either directly or indirectly. The measures used are described below:</p><p>a. The Social Media Use Scale -A 17-item scale used to measure the frequency, intensity, and patterns of social media usage in relation to its impact on mental health and wellbeing <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[19]</ref>. The Media and Eating Image Scale (MEIS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[20]</ref>and the Body Esteem Scale for Adolescents (BESSA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[21]</ref>, focusing on body comparison and body esteem were also used. b. The Political and Social Stress Scale (PSSS) -A scale used to measure the perceived stress of an individual in response to political and social events or conditions. It is especially relevant during times of civil unrest or policy change.</p><p>Survey F: Validating the Ndetei-Othieno-Kathuku scale for depression and anxiety.</p><p>This survey focused on using the Ndetei-Othieno-Kathuku scale for assessing depression and anxiety, in comparison to the common Patient Health Questionnaire. The NOK was developed as a tool with cultural relevance within the African context and ethnographically grounded. This was captured using the Ndetei-Othieno-Kathuku Scale (NOK) -A 15 item subscale to measure depression and anxiety that is culturally adapted for African and Kenyan individuals in the context of culturally specific idioms of distress <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[22]</ref>.</p><p>In addition to the outcomes, all participants (n=17,089) in all the surveys completed a selfreport socio-demographic questionnaire, which contained basic information such as age and gender, and socio-demographic information (e.g., level of parent education, religion, parents alive).</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Survey D: Covid-19 and climate change stressors. This survey contained measures that assess the levels of stress caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and climate change, as emerging stressors. The tools used are: a. The COVID-19 Stressor Scale (CSS) -A 36-item tool used to assess stressors associated with the COVID-19 pandemic among individuals [17]. b.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations</head><p>Several limitations should be considered when using this dataset. The sampling was restricted to public secondary school students, excluding private school attendees and out-of-school youth who may experience different mental health patterns. Geographic coverage was limited to four of Kenya's 47 counties, potentially limiting national generalizability despite diverse county selection.</p><p>All measures were self-reported, introducing potential recall bias and social desirability effects. Some contextual measures showed lower reliability coefficients, reflecting cultural adaptation challenges. Cross-sectional design prevents causal inference and assessment of mental health trajectories over time.</p><p>School-based sampling may underrepresent adolescents with the most severe mental health challenges who may have dropped out of education. Rural-urban differences within counties were not systematically examined, and seasonal variations in mental health symptoms could not be assessed due to single time-point collection.</p></div>
