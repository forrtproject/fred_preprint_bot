<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Studies of visual memory have extensively investigated both the breadth and capacity limits of visual memory. Classical as well as more recent Long-Term Memory (LTM) studies found that observers can remember a vast number of items and their features or states, to the extent that, effectively, no upper bound of capacity was established (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Brady et al., 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Brady et al., , 2011;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Konkle et al., 2010a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Konkle et al., , 2010b;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Shepard, 1967;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Standing 1973)</ref>. Those studies used meaningful items such as real-world objects and scenes as memoranda, lending support for the important role of semantic meaning in visual LTM (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Brady et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">Konkle et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Koutstaal et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Kramer et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr">Reder et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Shoval et al., 2023a)</ref>. Indeed, when real-world objects were stripped of their semantic meaning through scrambling and distortion, visual memory capacity was shown to be dramatically reduced <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Shoval et al., 2023b)</ref>.</p><p>In an attempt to avoid LTM influences, however, classical visual working memory (VWM) studies have typically employed 'low-level' stimuli such as colors, line orientations, and meaningless matrix patterns (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Luck &amp; Vogel, 1997</ref><ref type="bibr">, Phillips, 1974)</ref>. In contrast to LTM findings, these studies have traditionally demonstrated a highly limited capacity system in VWM (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Cowan, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Luck &amp; Vogel, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Oberauer et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Zhang &amp; Luck, 2008)</ref>. However, recent research has indicated that VWM performance is actually enhanced when the memoranda carry semantic meaning (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Asp et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Brady et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Brady &amp; Störmer, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Chung et al., 2023a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Conci et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Conci et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Sahar et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Shoval &amp; Makovski, 2022)</ref>.</p><p>For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Sahar et al. (2020)</ref> compared VWM and the metamemory of meaningful and meaningless stimuli. The meaningful stimuli comprised of images of real-world objects <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Brady et al., 2008)</ref>, while the meaningless stimuli were the same images subjected to a simple image manipulation, preserving most visual properties while reducing their meaning (see, <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Makovski, 2018)</ref>. The results revealed that participants better remembered semantically meaningful items than meaningless items, with higher confidence. The disadvantage of meaningless items was observed in following studies regardless of whether the items were "lightly" (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Makovski, 2018, or "</ref>heavily" <ref type="bibr">(Stojanoski &amp; Cusack, 2014, fig. 1b</ref>) distorted <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Brady &amp; Störmer, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Shoval &amp; Makovski, 2022)</ref>. Another study <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Brady &amp; Störmer, 2022)</ref> showed that meaningful items were better remembered in both serial and simultaneous presentation than blobs of colors and distorted items (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Chung et al., 2023a)</ref>. Supported by past findings of a larger CDA (Contralateral Delayed Activity) component for real-world items than color patches <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Brady et al., 2016)</ref>, the authors stipulated that memory capacity is boosted for meaningful items since they receive in-depth encoding and stronger active maintenance in VWM (see, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Asp et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr">also, Brady et al., 2019 in LTM)</ref>. While a follow-up study <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Thibeault et al., 2023)</ref> was not able to pinpoint the precise locus of improvement (i.e., encoding, maintenance, or retrieval), it too, demonstrated an improvement in capacity estimates (Cowan's-K) of meaningful stimuli compared to meaningless items. The authors suggested it is the conceptual meaning rather than the visual complexity of the items that drives a VWM advantage for real-world object identities.</p><p>The semantic meaning of an (visual) item can be defined from various perspectives. Here, we consider the semantics of an object as typically derived from its basic-level category, namely, the level at which the item can be labeled. It's important to note that a label or a name encapsulates a set of critical features defining the item <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Rosch, 1975;</ref><ref type="bibr">see, Gasparri &amp; Marconi, 2021</ref>), yet the manner in which these features contribute to visual memory remains largely unclear. That is, how idiosyncratic non-visual information (i.e., conceptual meaning) contributes to the enhancement of visual information in memory is quite remarkable and not yet fully explained.</p><p>There are several, not mutually exclusive, explanations for the advantage of semantic meaning in VWM. In some studies, semantic meaning has been described as a "hook", or a "scaffold" for visual detail (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Chung et al., 2023a;</ref><ref type="bibr">Konkle et al., 2010)</ref>. More specifically, it was suggested that real-world objects are stored in memory at both feature and object-based levels, with the latter linked to conceptual knowledge. This hierarchical organization provides a valuable structure (or 'scaffold') for low-level visual features and a higher-dimensional representation, thereby enhancing VWM (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Chung et al., 2023a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">, Wyble et al., 2016)</ref>. From a neurophysiological perspective, meaningful items may activate brain regions that support the formation of more vivid visual memories, compared to meaningless stimuli (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Asp et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Brady &amp; Alvarez, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Shoham et al., 2022)</ref>. Relatedly, some argued that prior knowledge about an object enables the "chunking" of information, thereby reducing capacity limitations and enabling observers to maintain more features and information (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Brady et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Conci et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>Previous existing knowledge is also tied to stimulus familiarity, with familiar items benefiting from better consolidation of items into VWM <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Blalock, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Shoval &amp; Makovski, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Xie &amp; Zhang, 2017</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">, 2018)</ref>. In alignment with this perspective, other views have proposed that familiarity contributes to visual memory performance by freeing attentional resources to encode more visual information and facilitate feature-to-feature binding <ref type="bibr">(Popov &amp; Reder, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr">Popov et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr">Reder et al., 2013)</ref>. Another way in which meaning might play a role in VWM is through the engagement of verbal LTM or labeling.</p><p>When participants are given the option to use a term that describes the visual stimulus (i.e., a label), VWM performance improves both in terms of quantity and quality compared to a condition involving meaningless articulatory suppression <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Souza &amp; Skóra, 2017)</ref>. Labeling has been shown to boost VWM performance by allowing to maintain and protect a detailed representation in VWM <ref type="bibr">(Overcott &amp; Souza, 2022</ref><ref type="bibr">, 2023)</ref>. However, conceptual meaning does not necessitate explicit verbal encoding. It was suggested that meaningful visual items might activate some form of conceptual, and perhaps prototypical, knowledge irrespective of verbal encoding <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bae et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Sahar et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Souza et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Markov &amp; Utochkin, 2022)</ref>.</p><p>Given the intimate connection between perceptual and conceptual information in everyday objects, it is often highly challenging to separate the two and isolate 'perceptual' memory per se (see <ref type="bibr">Konkle et al., 2010, in LTM)</ref>.</p><p>Notably, the type of visual information being tested might affect one's conclusions. For instance, A feature might be easier to encode and consolidate into VWM if it aligns with pre-existing knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Olsson &amp; Poom, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bae et al., 2015)</ref>, or if it is diagnostic of the object's nature/identity (e.g., distinguishing between a green and yellow banana, or recognizing the colors of a familiar flag, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Conci et al., 2021)</ref>. In the present study, we therefore asked whether conceptual knowledge can affect memory for visual details that are not associated with an item's core essence. Specifically, we investigated whether meaning can enhance VWM of an arbitrary object feature, such as its spatial location.</p><p>If meaning does indeed enhance location memory performance, we aimed to observe whether this enhancement operates in terms of memory resolution or other factors. The results of <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Chung et al. (2023a)</ref>, demonstrating that memory for an arbitrary color is enhanced for meaningful items, already suggest that the influences of meaning might not be restricted to the item's identity. Yet, it is not clear whether this result can be generalized to other dimensions that are not directly related to the item's intrinsic features.</p><p>Critically, in the context of the current study, location serves as an arbitrary feature that is independent of the item's identity.</p><p>Furthermore, testing spatial location memory is essential because many researchers have argued that location constitutes a unique feature, playing a key role in attention, perception, and VWM (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Golomb et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Lamy &amp; Tsal, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Makovski 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Pertzov &amp; Husain, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Treisman &amp; Gelade, 1980)</ref>, specifically in the binding of different features together <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Oberauer &amp; Lin, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Schneegans &amp; Bays, 2017</ref><ref type="bibr">, but see Li et al., 2022)</ref>. The goal of the study was thus to test the effects of meaning on spatial memory, by comparing performance for meaningful (i.e., intact, real-world) with meaningless (i.e., scrambled) objects (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1</ref>). Furthermore, using a mixture-modeling approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bays, et al., 2009)</ref>, we were able to test which parameters were specifically affected by the item's meaning (for a similar approach, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Markov &amp; Utochkin, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr">Popov et al., 2022)</ref>. There are several possible outcomes to the mixture-modeling approach (see graphical illustration in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>, right): (1) An effect on the SD parameter (i.e., smaller SDs for meaningful items) would suggest better location memory precision.</p><p>That is, meaning creates a more precise location representation. (2) An effect on the Guess-rate would suggest that meaning boosts the number of locations stored in VWM. (3) Fewer swap errors for meaningful items would suggest a stronger linkage between arbitrary spatial location and identity.</p><p>Note that the combination of Guess-rate and the Swap rate indexes the number of correct object locations stored in memory: If meaning boosts the number of locations stored in VWM, then we should expect a higher rate of correct target responses given the item's identity (i.e., fewer errors due to guesses and swaps) for the meaningful stimuli.</p><p>It is also noteworthy that any combination of these outcomes is possible and that these possibilities do not necessarily refute the suggested theories and accounts. This is because the theories can be modified to accommodate any of the (parameters) outcomes. For example, if all items have an accessible memory signal but it is weakly bound to their specific locations, "increased capacity" could be expressed as fewer swap errors.</p><p>The current study, therefore, was not designed to pit the different theoretical views against each other, but rather to ask which aspects of memory performance (i.e., parameters in the model) would be mostly affected by stimulus meaning.</p><p>To preview our results, Experiment 1 found that meaning had a large effect on VWM performance that translated to an effect on swap errors, while there was no effect on the guess rate or the precision rate (SD). Experiment 2 replicated Experiment 1's results, even though it included masks that impaired overall performance, negating the possibility that the lack of an effect on precision might have resulted from a ceiling effect. Experiment 3 further tested VWM for a larger memory set size, and yet the main results remained the same: meaning reduced swap errors but did not affect the guess rate or the precision factor. Since all experiments share the same general method, we report them all collectively.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample-size</head><p>We adopted an open-ended Bayesian design <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Schönbrodt &amp; Wagenmakers, 2018)</ref>. We set the minimal sample size at 20 participants. This sample size allows us to detect a large effect (Cohen's d = .7, p-value = .05) with 85% statistical power. Due to the exploratory nature of Experiment 1, we allowed a larger sample size to make sure we could detect an effect (if any) on each parameter and adopted a stricter criterion to stop collecting data (i.e., BF &gt; 100 for H 0 or H 1 ). In Experiments 2 and 3, given the observed effects of Experiment 1, we adopted a looser criterion for stopping the collection of data: when a two-sided Bayesian paired samples t-test for the average absolute error (i.e., Meaningful vs. Meaningless) showed a BF 1 above 3 (for 1 In the results section BF 10 denotes the Bayes Factor in favor of a difference (i.e., an effect present) while BF 01 denotes the Bayes Factor in favor of a no-difference (i.e., the absence of an effect). The two measures are reciprocal and easily interchangeable: either H 0 or, H 1 ). The mixture modeling was performed only after the data collection was completed.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Suchow et al., 2013)</ref>. All stimuli appeared against a white background (RGB = [0, 0, 0]). All experiments included a starting fixation display (a black cross, 50 pix). Stimuli appeared on an invisible circle with a radius of 380 pix <ref type="bibr">(11.4 [ , except</ref> in Experiment 3 in which it was visible and appeared in black <ref type="bibr">(RGB = [255,</ref><ref type="bibr">255,</ref><ref type="bibr">255]</ref>). Each image size was 160 x 160 pix <ref type="bibr">(4.8 [ x 4.8 [ )</ref>, except for Experiment 3 in which the image size was 100 x 100 pix (3 [ x 3 [ ). The image set (for each participant) included 600 randomly sampled intact images of everyday objects from a previously published set (which contains 1600 images, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Brady et al., 2008)</ref>. The distorted images were a subset of 600 scrambled versions of intact images, also sampled from the larger pool (of 1600 scrambled images). Thus, images in the two conditions were roughly matched across participants. Scrambling was performed by diffeomorphic transformations <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Stojanoski &amp; Cusack, 2014</ref>) that distorted the images' meaning while keeping most of the visual statistics intact <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Brady &amp; Störmer, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Shoval &amp; Makovski, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Shoval et al., 2023b</ref>). An image of a multi-colored circle was presented before the first and after the last items so each trial sequence started and ended with the colored-squares image. The mask image was a circle filled with multi-colored squares, of the same dimensions as the images. The locations of the memory items were achieved by presenting the stimuli in a radial orientation ranging from 1° to 360° in steps of 1°. Each image (160 x 160 pix) appeared in a random, unique position with the restriction of a minimum distance of 30° between the images. Participants responded to the memory-location task by using the mouse to adjust a response probe to the target's location. The response probe was a white circle (radius Experiments 1 and 2: 80 pix, 2.4 [ ; Experiment 3: 50 pix, 1.5 [ ) that appeared on a visible black circle <ref type="bibr">(RGB = [255,</ref><ref type="bibr">255,</ref><ref type="bibr">255]</ref>), of the same dimensions as the objects presented during encoding. After the response, participants received written feedback ("your error is X degrees", RGB = [0,0,0], Helvetica, 30pix) presented inside the response circle, 80 pix below the probe. In addition, the correct target location appeared on the circle with a red "X", and the participant's response appeared simultaneously with a blue "O" (40 pix).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment 1</head><p>The task of the participants was to remember the location of four images so they could adjust the probe to match the target's location. Four unique images, either Intact (Meaningful) or Distorted (Meaningless), were randomly sampled and each image was used only once throughout the experiment.</p><p>Each trial began with a 700 ms fixation display-a black plus sign (50 pix) that remained visible throughout the trial. The first colored circle appeared at the center of the screen for 1000 ms. Then, each of the four images appeared in their location, in isolation, for 500 ms, followed by a 500 ms blank screen. After the presentation of all four images, the colored-circle image appeared again at the center of the screen for 1000 ms. Then, after another blank screen of 1000 ms, the target image appeared at the center of a black circle (drawn in the same radius as the presentation sequence). The target was one of the four images from the trial's sequence and its serial position was evenly and randomly assigned across trials. Once the participant clicked with the mouse on the circle, the response probe, a white circle, appeared at the clicked location on the circle's perimeter. The participant adjusted the probe (using the mouse) and validated her response by pressing the spacebar key on the keyboard. Notably, there was no time limit and participants could not validate their response without moving the mouse first. Afterward, the feedback display appeared for 1000 ms (Figure <ref type="figure">3a</ref>). Importantly, 96 trials of Meaningful items were randomly intermixed with 96 trials of Meaningless items trials (with each trial consisting of sametype objects only). For practice, participants performed a few test trials to ensure they understood the task. These trials were not recorded, and their images were not included in the experimental trials.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment 2</head><p>The design, procedure, and stimuli were the same as in Experiment 1 except for the following changes (see Figure <ref type="figure">3b</ref>). Each item appeared for 350 ms, followed by a mask image of the same object size, that appeared immediately after each of the objects in their location, for 650 ms. This was done in order to replicate Experiment 1's results under more demanding encoding conditions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment 3</head><p>To rule out the possibility that the lack of an SD (precision) effect was due to ceiling performance, as well as to directly test whether semantic meaning allows more locations to be stored in VWM for meaningful items, the memory set size was enlarged to six items. Increasing the number of potential target locations necessitated the use of smaller items and a larger circle, thus stimuli size was reduced to 100 x 100 pix. Note that this adjustment also creates more space for an SD effect. The black circle, serving as a landmark, remained visible throughout the trial while the items appeared on its perimeter. Finally, to shorten the experiment, the initial fixation display and the final fixation display were presented for 500ms only. The colored circle at the end of the sequence was not presented (see Figure <ref type="figure">3c</ref>). There was a total of 180 trials, 90 in each condition (i.e., Meaningful/Meaningless). In all other respects, the experiment was identical to Experiment 1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mixture-Model Analysis</head><p>On each trial, we calculated the error magnitude, that is, the difference between the adjusted probe location and the target location. The error magnitude ranged from ±180°. Modeling was performed with Memtoolbox <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Suchow et al., 2013)</ref> and we used the Swap model <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bays et al., 2009)</ref>. This for each condition 2 . In general, the model computes the SD based on errors around 0 (target). This estimate of SD is then applied around the center of each distractor. This holds that participants had the same 'target' precision but only misreported the location of the item. Because the items were widely separated, low-precision reports (within the range of the estimated SD) would fall within the appropriate item. Unrelated location reports would fall between items, and most likely would be classified as "guesses".</p><p>2 Recently, criticism was raised against some of the theoretical assumptions of mixture modeling approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Williams et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr">Brady et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Schurgin et al., 2020</ref>). Yet, not all researchers are convinced by these claims (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Tomić &amp; Bays, 2022)</ref>. Moreover, the methodological assumptions of the mixture-modeling are met in the present study; radial location is a linear variable (unlike color) and there is sufficient error space for the classification of both swaps and guesses (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bays, 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Furthermore, an empirical model comparison of the data showed that the swap model <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bays et al., 2009)</ref> provided the best fit, even against the variable precision model (which holds other theoretical assumptions).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Results from all experiments are detailed in Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>. To quickly overview, as can be seen in Figure <ref type="figure">4a</ref>, the model-free Mean Absolute Error (MAE) shows an effect of meaning across all experiments: a smaller overall magnitude of errors for meaningful than for meaningless items. As can be seen in Figure <ref type="figure">4b</ref>, depicting the mixture-model parameters, only the Swap parameter was affected by meaning, as trials containing meaningful items had fewer swap errors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment 1</head><p>Three participants were excluded from the analysis (2 for large MAE &gt; 80 [ , 1 participant's data did not converge). The removal of these data did not affect any of the conclusions. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Location memory precision</head><p>Given the idea that spatial location has a special status, in this analysis, we focused on the potential difference (or lack of) between experiments in the precision of location memory. An across-experiment analysis with the SD parameter as the dependent variable (Repeated Measures ANOVA: Meaningful/Meaningless as a within-subject factor, and Experiment as a betweensubjects factor), did not show statistically significant differences in the precision of spatial location by the item meaning, F(1,74) = .01, p = .917, nor by its interaction with the experiment, F(2,74) = .75, p = .473. Bayesian RMANOVA, with the same factors, corroborated that the precision parameter was unaffected by stimulus meaning (BF 01 = 8.4), and did not interact with experimental conditions (BF 01 = 8.9), noting an overall high degree of precision (M = 13.7 [ ). Thus, semantic meaning does not affect precision, which seems high to begin with.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Discussion</head><p>The present study examined how items' conceptual meaning affects VWM performance.</p><p>While traditional VWM research used simple stimuli to reduce LTM involvement, we manipulated the conceptual meaning of visually complex items, to directly examine LTM involvement in VWM. Specifically, we asked which aspect of memory is improved by conceptual meaning and whether meaning allows observers to better retain an arbitrary visual property of the stimuli, such as its spatial location. In three experiments, we compared two types of stimuli: Meaningful real-world items, and scrambled, meaningless items. The scrambling procedure preserved most of the visual statistics of the stimuli while stripping them of their semantic meaning <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Brady &amp; Störmer, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Chung et al., 2023a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Sahar et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Shoval &amp; Makovski, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr">Shoval et el., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Starr et al., 2020)</ref>, thus, the two stimulus sets mainly differed in their conceptual distinctiveness (but see reservation below).</p><p>Consequently, when observers were exposed to the scrambled, meaningless items, they could not readily access the items' conceptual information, instead primarily relying on their visual features.</p><p>Experiment 1 revealed a large overall benefit in the location memory of meaningful items.</p><p>When the memory performance was decomposed into parameters using a mixture-modeling analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bays et al., 2009)</ref>, we observed that the benefit was driven only by fewer swap errors, not by better precision or by a smaller guess rate. That is, the advantage of meaningful items resulted from the fact that observers were more frequently correct about the item's location given its known identity (i.e., the memory probe). The results also revealed a high precision in reporting the target's location along with a low guess rate that might have concealed an effect in these parameters. Therefore, in Experiment 2, we shortened the encoding duration and masked each item.</p><p>Despite an increase in the overall magnitude of errors, we observed again a large location memory benefit for meaningful items and the same pattern of results when decomposing the findings to the model parameters: Fewer swap errors for meaningful stimuli, along with no difference for both the SD and the guess-rate parameters. Experiment 3 used a larger set size, 6 items instead of 4 items. Once again, although this time smaller in magnitude, we observed an advantage for meaningful items. Consistently, as in the previous experiments, fewer swap errors were found for meaningful stimuli, and no effect was observed for the SD and the guess-rate parameters. Collectively, we showed that the semantic meaning benefit was driven by fewer swap errors for meaningful stimuli, rather than by improved precision or fewer location guesses.</p><p>Three main conclusions can be drawn from this study. First, overall memory performance, as measured by the model-free Mean Absolute Error magnitude (MAE), clearly showed that meaning improved memory performance, specifically for spatial memory of an arbitrary location. This result extends past findings demonstrating a role for conceptual meaning in VWM <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Asp et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Conci et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr">Overcott &amp; Souza, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Sahar et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Shoval &amp; Makovski, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Starr et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Störmer &amp; Brady, 2022)</ref>. Furthermore, our findings demonstrate that memory not only enhances stimulus aspects related to core identity, but also to an arbitrary feature, such as location or color <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Chung et al., 2023a)</ref>. The findings that semantic meaning dramatically improves VWM performance may challenge the external validity of numerous findings from previous studies using 'simple' (meaningless) stimuli.</p><p>Second, a deeper examination of performance reveals that the main factor affected by semantic meaning is feature binding, as participants made fewer location-identity (or, location-shape) swap errors with meaningful than meaningless items. This finding suggests that the enhancement of retention capacity by semantic meaning might specifically relate to stimulus feature-bindings, as suggested by <ref type="bibr">Oberauer (2019)</ref>. Our results are analogous to the findings of <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Markov and Utochkin (2022)</ref>, who used a similar location reproduction task and analysis. In contrast to the current study, these authors used only real-world items (i.e., meaningful stimuli), for which they varied the conceptual distinctiveness in the memory array. That is, they contrasted same-category item trials (e.g., all apples, characterized by a low distinctiveness) with different-category item trials (e.g., an apple, a mug, and a rabbit, characterized by a high distinctiveness).</p><p>Most relevant to the current results, <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Markov and Utochkin (2022)</ref> consistently found that categorical similarity did not affect correct recognition rates of the item's identity, and did not affect the overall precision or guess rate for spatial locations. Similarly to the present findings, more swap errors were observed under the low-distinctiveness (i.e., high similarity) than the high-distinctiveness (low similarity) condition. That is, observers frequently swapped the location of items within the same category, suggesting that conceptual similarity creates interference between items. Notably, however, items from the same conceptual category also shared a high degree of visual similarity, whereas, in the present study the meaningless items varied in their perceptual features (albeit the scrambling procedure may have somewhat reduced their visual distinctiveness, relative to the meaningful objects). Nevertheless, despite these differences, the conclusions of both studies converge on each other: observers tend to rely on conceptual meaning in reducing item-to-item interference when maintaining and retrieving stimuli's locations in VWM. Note that similar results were obtained when examining the effects of conceptual meaning on memory for an arbitrary color, that is, an enhanced item-color binding for the meaningful objects <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Chung et al., 2023a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Chung et al., , 2023b))</ref>.</p><p>Lastly, the semantic meaning of the items did not affect the degree of location memory precision, which remained relatively high across all three experiments. Though speculative, this high precision might reflect the special status of spatial location. A similar high precision was observed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Markov and Utochkin (2022)</ref>, using a within-vs. between-category manipulation. Furthermore, recent findings demonstrated that the recall of stimulus location (on a continuous report scale) yielded the highest precision and accuracy rates, compared to orientation, color, and shape <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Tomić &amp; Bays, 2022)</ref>. Thus, the inherently high accuracy and precision of spatial locations in this, as well as other studies, might have obscured a potential effect with the precision parameter. Alternatively, the absence of a semantic effect on spatial location memory may suggest that spatial location per-se ('where') is processed independently of semantic meaning ('what'), and therefore, the latter exerts little direct impact on it. However, such a segregated view may oversimplify matters, as findings have shown that semantics and real-world items improved the accuracy in spatial working memory change-detection tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Hu &amp; Jacobs, 2021)</ref>.</p><p>Despite clear behavioral evidence that conceptual meaning improved itemfeature binding, the current study cannot provide a definitive underlying mechanism for this pattern of results. However, at least two explanatory models have nevertheless been suggested for the effects of conceptual meaning on memory. First, Popov and Reder (2020) provided a computational model that showed that contextual memory effects in word lists (e.g., recency, primacy, etc.), can be explained by the frequency (i.e., familiarity) of the stimuli. Given a limited pool of resources, the authors suggested that high-frequency words were better remembered due to their consumption of less attentional resources for encoding than low-frequency words. They concluded that the formation of a memory representation requires the use of resources proportionally to the item's memory strength (i.e., reflecting as a robust and accessible representation). In the present study, one might consider meaningful items to be more 'strongly' encoded due to their inherent familiarity, relative to the novel, scrambled items. Put differently, meaningful items have a stronger memory signal since they are heavily associated with prior knowledge. Consequently, they require less resources for their encoding, sparing more resources for the encoding of additional information, such as their location (see also <ref type="bibr">Reder, 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">, Bellana et al., 2021)</ref>. This idea is closely related to the notion that activating an LTM representation in VWM consists of prototypical information (like a common label, shape, and surface features) that strongly defines the object. Such information can increase the dimensionality of the representation while reducing the information entropy (i.e., the cost of processing every bit of visual information). Interestingly, consistent with the findings of our study, <ref type="bibr">Popov et al. (2022)</ref> showed that word familiarity (operationalized by high vs.</p><p>low frequency) affected the probability of location swap errors, but not the precision memory of the target location. Again, the fact that feature-binding processes are long known to require attentional capacity (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Treisman &amp; Gelade, 1980</ref>) is highly consistent with the resource-based account <ref type="bibr">(Popov &amp; Reder, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr">Popov et al., 2022)</ref>.</p><p>A different model, emerging from a signal detection perspective ("Target Confusability Competition", TCC, Shurgin et al., 2020, see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Brady et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr">Oberauer, 2023)</ref>, suggests that swap errors occur due to a lower signal-to-noise ratio (i.e., lower d'). That is, visual similarity between items creates "confusability" between the target item and the foils. This is consistent with the current result as one may suggest that meaningful items have a stronger memory signal, on the account that they are more visually and a conceptually distinct. Although the scrambling manipulation maintained most low-level features and image statistics, the fact that local as well as global contours were largely blurred turned the meaningless items into somewhat less visually distinct from each other. Whether on a visual or a conceptual level, both types of distinctiveness (i.e., degree of similarity)</p><p>can contribute to such pattern of errors (but see, <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Tomić &amp; Bays, 2022)</ref>.</p><p>Further research is needed to examine, for example, if similar (conceptually) meaningful items that strongly differ in visual properties indeed support a stronger memory signal.</p><p>To conclude, our findings show that spatial location memory, as an arbitrary visual property, benefits from the item's conceptual meaning. This finding corroborates previous research, demonstrating how LTM involvement (longterm conceptual knowledge) enhances VWM performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Asp et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Chung et al., 2023a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Conci et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Oberauer et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Overcott &amp; Souza, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Sahar et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Shoval &amp; Makovski, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Störmer &amp; Brady, 2022)</ref>. Critically, we show that meaning improves VWM for an item's location by specifically enhancing the binding between objects and their features similar to previous findings <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Chung et al., 2023a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Markov &amp; Utochkin, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr">Oberauer, 2019)</ref>, however, there was reliable evidence against the contribution of conceptual knowledge to VWM precision and/or the number of remembered locations. Nevertheless, meaningful semantics enhanced the capacity of information in VWM. Additional research is required to further uncover the nature of the interaction between LTM and VWM representations. </p></div>

A twosided paired samples t-test revealed a significant difference between the two conditions, t(31) = 4.18, p &lt; .001, d = .73, and a substantial Bayes factor of BF 10 = 125 was in accord with the stopping rule. Next, we compared each of the three model's parameters, between meaningful and meaningless trials. Only the swap error parameter (B) was significantly different between the conditions, t(31) = 4.4, p &lt;.001, d = .79, BF 10 = 274.We did not observe a significant difference in the SD parameter, t(31) = 1.1, p = .242, d = .21, BF 01 = 2.77, or in the guess rate parameter, t(31) = 0.5, p = .613, d = .09, BF 01 = 4.69.ExperimentTwo participants were excluded from the analysis (MAE &gt; 80 ) and the removal of these data did not affect any of the conclusions.Overall performance was indeed worse in Experiment 2 than in Experiment 1 as seen in the MAE (independent samples, M = 52 [ vs 39 [ , t(52) = 3.43, p = .001, d = .95). Importantly, once again, there was an effect of meaning on the MAE, t(21) = 3.75, p = .001, d = .8, and the Bayes factor of BF 10 = 31 was in accord with the stopping rule. Comparing the model parameters, we observed the same results as in Experiment 1. The swap error parameter (B) was significantly different between the conditions, t(21) = 3.76, p = .001, d = .8, BF 10 = 31. We did not observe a statistically significant difference in the SD parameter, t(21) = .7, p = .468, d = .15, BF 01 = 3.5, nor in the guess rate parameter, t(21) = 0.4Two participants were excluded from the analysis (1 participant's data did not converge and 1 participant's SD estimate was inflated (SD &gt; 89 [)). The removal of these data did not affect any of the conclusions.Increasing memory set size had a large effect on the overall memory performance compared to Experiment 1, as evident in the MAE (nonparametric independent samples Welch, M = 59[ vs 39 [ , t(48.6) = 6.2, p &lt; .001, d = 1.6).Nevertheless, we observed the same pattern of results as in our previous experiments. The overall effect of meaning was significant, as evident in the MAE magnitude, t(22) = 3.09, p = .005, d = .64, and the Bayes factor of BF 10 = 8.3 was in accord with the stoppage rule. Still, once again, the same pattern emerged: a significant difference for the swap error parameter, t(22) =3.14, p = .005, d = .655, BF 10 = 9.2, but not for the SD parameter, t(22) = .18, p = .852, d = .03, BF 01 = 4.4, nor the guess rate, t(22) = .79, p = .435, d = .16, BF 01 = 3.4.</figDesc></figure>
