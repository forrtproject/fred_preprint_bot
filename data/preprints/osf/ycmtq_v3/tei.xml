<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>This paper builds directly upon the theoretical foundation established in <ref type="bibr">[14]</ref>, where the concept of a time-independent, energy-space manifold was introduced as a reformulation of classical and quantum physics. Here, we extend that framework to the gravitational domain, developing a novel entropic formulation of gravity that incorporates connections to General Relativity (GR), loop quantum gravity (LQG), string theory, and holographic duality. The result is a unified energy-space perspective on gravitational physics, which leads naturally to testable predictions and proposes a path toward a deeper understanding of quantum gravity.</p><p>General Relativity has long been the cornerstone of gravitational theory, providing a geometrical description of spacetime curvature sourced by mass-energy. However, GR remains incomplete in its integration with quantum mechanics and does not account for thermodynamic or entropic considerations at a fundamental level. Efforts to address this limitation have led to a variety of approaches -including entropic gravity, emergent spacetime frameworks, and the thermodynamic derivation of Einstein's equations.</p><p>In this work, we propose an entropy-driven reinterpretation of gravity within the context of energy-space, where entropy gradients act as the source of motion and curvature. Time is no longer treated as a fundamental coordinate but is replaced by directional evolution along entropy flows. Within this formulation, the gravitational field equations are derived from a variational principle containing an entropy current vector, leading to a modified Einstein tensor and an entropy-corrected geodesic equation. This covariant structure naturally extends to black hole thermodynamics, Friedmann cosmology, and gravitational wave propagation, with all derivations recovering standard GR in the limit of vanishing entropy divergence.</p><p>The framework is also shown to provide a novel bridge between classical gravity and quantum formulations. Connections to loop quantum gravity are drawn through the interpretation of entropy gradients as geometric transition drivers in spin networks, while holographic duality emerges from projecting energy-space dynamics onto lower-dimensional conformal boundaries. In addition, the model reproduces key features of AdS/CFT and suggests energyspace analogues to the Ryu-Takayanagi prescription for entanglement entropy.</p><p>Crucially, the theory produces concrete and falsifiable predictions. These include frequencydependent gravitational wave dispersion, observable anomalies in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) spectrum, gravitational lensing deviations, and shifts in Casimir forcesall of which can be constrained or validated using current and upcoming observational platforms.</p><p>Through this extended formulation, we argue that energy-space gravity provides a viable and physically motivated pathway toward reconciling general relativity with thermodynamics and quantum field theory. The work presented here aims to advance that program and may serve as a conceptual and mathematical stepping stone toward a unified theory of gravitational and quantum phenomena.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Mathematical Framework of Energy-Space Gravity</head><p>We introduce an energy-space reformulation of Einstein's field equations, incorporating entropic corrections:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">𝐺 𝜇𝜈 + Λ𝑔 𝜇𝜈 = 8π𝐺(𝑇 𝜇𝜈 + α∇𝑆 𝜇𝜈 )<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where:</p><p>• 𝐺 𝜇𝜈 is the Einstein tensor representing spacetime curvature,</p><p>• ∇𝑆 𝜇𝜈 introduces energy-space corrections to geodesic motion,</p><p>• α is a parameter quantifying energy-space coupling,</p><p>• The model naturally recovers General Relativity in the limit α → 0 but predicts deviations in high-entropy regions (e.g., near black holes, in early universe conditions).</p><p>This modified equation suggests that entropy gradients influence the evolution of gravitational systems, leading to observable effects in astrophysics and cosmology.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Thermodynamic Derivation of Energy-Space Gravity</head><p>In standard thermodynamic gravity (Jacobson, 1995), Einstein's equations emerge naturally from the Clausius relation applied to local causal horizons <ref type="bibr">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">16,</ref><ref type="bibr">17]</ref>. Similarly, in the energyspace framework, gravity emerges as an entropic force driven by gradients in entropy density.</p><p>Starting with the Clausius relation applied to a local causal horizon:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">δ𝑄 = 𝑇 𝑑𝑆<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where:</p><p>δ𝑄 is the heat flux crossing the horizon, 𝑇 is the Unruh temperature perceived by an accelerated observer, 𝑑𝑆 is the entropy differential associated with horizon changes.</p><p>We introduce an energy-space entropy flow vector, 𝑠 μ , such that:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">𝑑𝑆 = -∫𝐬 𝜇 Σ 𝑘 μ 𝑑λ𝑑𝐴<label>(3)</label></formula><p>with:</p><p>𝑘 μ being the null generator tangent to the horizon, 𝑑λ the affine parameter, and 𝑑𝐴 the horizon's cross-sectional area element, 𝒔 𝝁 is a covariant entropy flow vector originating from matter-energy distributions or boundary interactions -it is treated as a dynamically coupled field whose divergence 𝛁 𝝁 𝒔 𝝁 sources curvature.</p><p>Then, the heat flux is related to the energy-momentum tensor 𝑇 μν :</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">δ𝑄 = ∫𝑇 μν 𝑘 μ Σ 𝑘 ν 𝑑λ𝑑𝐴<label>(4)</label></formula><p>Substituting these into the Clausius relation, we have:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">∫𝑇 μν 𝑘 μ Σ 𝑘 ν 𝑑λ𝑑𝐴 = -𝑇 ∫𝑠 μ Σ 𝑘 μ 𝑑λ𝑑𝐴<label>(5)</label></formula><p>Since this holds for arbitrary local horizons, we obtain a local differential relation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">𝑇 μν 𝑘 μ 𝑘 ν = -𝑇𝑠 μ 𝑘 μ<label>(6)</label></formula><p>Because the null vector 𝑘 μ is arbitrary, this implies a covariant identity:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">𝑇 μν + 𝑇𝑆 (μ}𝑢 {ν) = 1 8π𝐺 (𝑅 μν - 1 2 𝑅𝑔 μν )<label>(7)</label></formula><p>This gives a modified Einstein equation explicitly containing entropy gradients via 𝑆 :</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">𝑅 μν - 1 2 𝑅𝑔 μν = 8π𝐺 (𝑇 μν + 𝑇𝑆 (μ}𝑢 {ν) )<label>(8)</label></formula><p>Thus, entropy gradients explicitly modify spacetime geometry, forming the basis of Energy-Space Gravity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Energy as an Active Coordinate in Field Evolution</head><p>In this framework, energy is elevated from its role as a conserved scalar to a generalized coordinate within the energy-space evolution manifold. Evolution occurs along energy gradients rather than along time intervals.</p><p>Despite this transition, conservation is retained through a structural invariance:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">𝒟𝐻 = 0<label>(9)</label></formula><p>This preserves the physical role of energy as a generator of symmetry. It also defines a conserved "momentum" in energy-space evolution, analogous to time-translation invariance in classical field theory.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Entropy-Corrected Einstein Field Equations</head><p>We refine the entropy-modified Einstein field equations by defining a symmetric, covariant correction tensor Θ μν :</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">𝐺 μν + α(∇ μ 𝑠 ν + ∇ ν 𝑠 μ -𝑔 μν ∇ λ 𝑠 λ ) = κ𝑇 μν<label>(10)</label></formula><p>with:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">Θ μν = ∇ μ 𝑠 ν + ∇ ν 𝑠 μ -𝑔 μν ∇ λ 𝑠 λ<label>(11)</label></formula><p>and in contravariant form</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">Θ μν = ∇ μ 𝑠 ν + ∇ ν 𝑠 μ -𝑔 μν ∇ λ 𝑠 λ , with 𝑠 μ = 𝑔 μρ 𝑠 ρ<label>(12)</label></formula><p>where:</p><p>𝑠 ρ is the entropy current vector, α is the energy-space coupling parameter, κ = 8π𝐺 in natural units,</p><p>The entropy current vector 𝑠 μ is defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">𝑠 μ = 𝑠 𝑢 μ (<label>13</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_13">)</formula><p>where 𝑠 is the scalar entropy density and 𝑢 μ is the local normalized energy-space 4-velocity.</p><p>Its divergence ∇ μ 𝑠 μ quantifies entropy flux, and appears as a source in the modified Einstein field equations. This formulation aligns with thermodynamic flux representations in nonequilibrium systems and ensures geometric consistency.</p><p>The entropy correction tensor Θ μν is derived via variation of an entropy-coupled action, ensuring conservation and symmetry in analogy to thermodynamic flux tensors. This is conceptually consistent with recent generalizations of entropy in higher curvature gravity <ref type="bibr">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">16]</ref>. The entropy correction tensor Θ μν is derived via variation of an entropy-coupled action and satisfies symmetry and covariant conservation. It can be interpreted as</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">Θ μν = 1 √-𝑔 δ𝑆 entropy δ𝑔 μν<label>(14)</label></formula><p>where 𝑆 entropy is the entropy action functional. This formulation ensures compatibility with the Bianchi identities and allows entropy gradients to act as geometrically consistent sources of curvature. Unlike external scalar field additions, the tensor arises directly from entropy dynamics within the energy-space manifold.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Energy-space Modified Geodesic Equation</head><p>In energy-space gravity, the motion of particles is influenced by entropy gradients. The modified geodesic equation becomes:</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">𝐷𝑢 μ 𝑑λ = -β(𝑔 μν -𝑢 μ 𝑢 ν )∇ ν 𝑠<label>(15)</label></formula><p>where:</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">𝑢 μ = 𝑑𝑥 μ 𝑑λ</formula><p>is the 4-velocity along the path, 𝑠 is a scalar entropy field, β is the entropic coupling strength.</p><p>This equation preserves orthogonality of the entropic force to the trajectory and resembles a thermodynamic acceleration in curved space.</p><p>The modified geodesic equation</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">𝑢 ν ∇ ν 𝑢 μ = γ∇ μ σ<label>(16)</label></formula><p>follows from an entropy-augmented action principle:</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">𝑆 = ∫ [-𝑚√-𝑔 μν 𝑥 μ ̇𝑥ν ̇+ γσ(𝑥)] 𝑑 τ<label>(17)</label></formula><p>Variation yields an entropic force term consistent with acceleration along entropy gradients, providing a physically grounded correction to standard geodesic motion.</p><p>In the present formulation, entropy is treated both as a conserved flow and as a potential source of curvature. These two roles are not contradictory but correspond to different physical regimes. In closed, near-equilibrium systems the entropy current satisfies 𝛻 • 𝑠 𝜇 = 0, recovering conservation. However, in high-curvature or non-equilibrium domains (for example near black hole horizons or during cosmological phase transitions), 𝛻 • 𝑠 𝜇 ≠ 0 introduces effective source terms in 𝛩 𝜇 𝜈. This dual treatment reflects the thermodynamic reality that entropy is conserved locally under reversible evolution, but diverges under irreversible processes. The framework therefore generalizes GR by embedding both equilibrium geodesics and entropy-sourcing regimes within a single energy-space structure.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5">Entropy-Driven Friedmann Equation</head><p>In an FLRW background, the energy-space modified Friedmann equation is written as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">𝐻 2 = 8π𝐺 3 ρ + γ 3 ( 𝑑𝑠 𝑑𝑡 + 3𝐻𝑠)<label>(18)</label></formula><p>where: 𝐻 = 𝑎̇/𝑎 is the Hubble parameter, 𝑠(𝑡) is the entropy density (per comoving volume), γ is the entropy-curvature coupling constant.</p><p>This term mimics a dynamic dark energy component driven by entropy gradients and naturally varies with cosmic entropy evolution.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.6">Energy-Space Covariant Derivative and Gauge Tensor</head><p>To generalize gauge theories in energy-space, we define the total covariant derivative:</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">𝐷 α ̃= ∂ ∂𝑥 α + ∂ ∂𝐸 + 𝑖𝑔𝐴 α (𝐸, 𝑥)<label>(19)</label></formula><p>and the energy-space field strength tensor becomes:</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">𝐹 μν ̃= 𝐷 μ ̃𝐴ν -𝐷 ν ̃𝐴μ + 𝑖𝑔[𝐴 μ , 𝐴 ν ]<label>(20)</label></formula><p>This definition:</p><p>• Incorporates energy as a geometric coordinate on par with spatial coordinates,</p><p>• Allows entropy gradient effects to directly modify gauge field propagation and structure.</p></div>

Based on gravitational wave timing and pulsar delay estimates, we propose tentative upper bounds:</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">κ ≲ 10 -16 m -1 , γ ≲ 10 -11 J -1</formula><p>These values remain below detection thresholds for most current systems, yet are within reach of next-generation observatories. These constants serve as adjustable parameters within the theory and are subject to refinement as experimental resolution improves.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.8">Causal Structure and Emergent Time</head><p>The energy-space model removes time as a fundamental coordinate. Instead, causality and evolution emerge from monotonic changes in entropy. This framework resonates with timeless formulations of physics (e.g., Barbour's relational mechanics <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[18]</ref>), in which change is represented through configuration shifts rather than an external time parameter. In energy-space, the ordering of events is governed by the direction of entropy flow, allowing for welldefined causal relations even in the absence of global temporal structure.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="10">Quantum Gravity Without Fundamental Time</head><p>A primary challenge in quantum gravity theories-such as loop quantum gravity (LQG), string theory, or Wheeler-DeWitt quantum cosmology-is the "problem of time," where classical time no longer serves as a valid variable at Planck scales. Energy-space gravity provides a robust theoretical solution by completely removing time as a fundamental entity.</p><p>In the Wheeler-DeWitt equation framework:</p><formula xml:id="formula_61">𝐻 ̂Ψ[ℎ 𝑖𝑗 , ϕ] = 0<label>(64)</label></formula><p>time does not explicitly appear. The energy-space formulation embraces this naturally, interpreting the universe's quantum state as evolving through transitions in energy-space rather than temporal evolution.</p><p>Moreover, in loop quantum gravity, discrete spin networks and spin foams evolve via "moves" that lack continuous time parameters. Energy-space gravity naturally aligns with this discretized viewpoint-entropy gradients become the fundamental "driver" of state transitions, providing a clear, physically meaningful alternative to traditional time-evolution pictures.</p><p>Thus, the removal of fundamental time in the energy-space framework may resolve quantum gravity paradoxes, providing theoretical coherence and greater compatibility with quantum cosmological approaches.</p><p>system evolution is not governed by time but by energy-space gradients, particularly through entropy vector flows 𝑆 μ . This aligns conceptually with the relational evolution used in LQG, and provides an additional structure: a deterministic, gradient-based driver for transitions. One may envision an energy-space scalar field 𝑆 defining a transition weight between adjacent spin network configurations, such that:</p><formula xml:id="formula_62">𝐴 Γ (𝐸𝑆) ∼ exp (-∫λ 𝑆 ∇ 𝐸 𝑆 Γ 𝑑𝑉)<label>(65)</label></formula><p>where λ 𝑆 is a coupling constant and 𝑑𝑉 is the spin foam volume element. This formulation effectively weighs transitions not by proper time, but by energy-space action, potentially leading to a semi-classical limit wherein entropy gradients determine smooth curvature as observed in classical GR. Furthermore, since LQG is fundamentally built from Planck-scale quantum areas, the entropy-area relation central to black hole physics and the Bekenstein-Hawking formula is naturally embedded. The energy-space framework reinforces this connection by deriving gravity directly from entropy gradients, potentially offering a thermodynamic interpretation of spin network evolution.</p></div>

Notably, the AdS/CFT correspondence <ref type="bibr">[12]</ref> posits a duality between a gravitational theory in a bulk anti-de Sitter (AdS) space and a Conformal Field Theory (CFT) defined on its boundary, thereby realizing the holographic principle.</p><p>In the energy-space formalism, gravity emerges from entropy gradients, with no need for a preassumed time parameter. The bulk curvature tensor is sourced not by traditional energymomentum flux alone, but by entropy gradient contributions:</p><formula xml:id="formula_63">𝑅 μν - 1 2 𝑅𝑔 μν = 8π𝐺 (𝑇 μν + 𝑇𝑆 (μ}𝑢 {ν) )<label>(66)</label></formula><p>This formulation mirrors the bulk-boundary relationship in AdS/CFT, where boundary degrees of freedom determine bulk dynamics. In energy-space, the boundary is reinterpreted as an entropy-flow-defined hypersurface, and gravitational structure arises from the entropy gradient across this boundary. This opens a novel route to encode CFT boundary data through energyspace vector fields, enabling a new type of duality where:</p><formula xml:id="formula_64">𝑔 μν bulk ↔ δS/ δx μ<label>(67)</label></formula><p>Such a relation could be extended to suggest that compactified dimensions in string theory (e.g., 𝑆 1 , 𝑇 6 , or Calabi-Yau spaces) are not fundamental but rather emergent manifolds of constrained entropy flow across energy-space. This aligns with modern holographic theories where dimensionality emerges from entanglement entropy scaling <ref type="bibr">[13]</ref>.</p><p>Moreover, since time is problematic in both string field theory and cosmological applications of AdS/CFT, energy-space gravity provides a time-free background on which such holographic dualities might be redefined or generalized.</p></div>

In this context, the energy-space entropy vector may represent a macroscopic analogue of underlying statistical microprocesses-linking quantum and gravitational entropy under a unified thermodynamic principle.

In particular, it offers an alternative foundation for resolving the long-standing "problem of time" and may serve as a bridge between discrete and holographic formulations of spacetime such as Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG) and String Theory. This section explores the relevance and potential integration of the energy-space formalism into these leading theoretical paradigms.</p><p>Although the primary presentation of the framework is via modified Einstein equations, it admits a natural Hamiltonian extension. The entropy current 𝑠 𝜇 may be treated as an auxiliary field, with conjugate momentum defined by variations of the action density with respect to its temporal derivative. This ensures closure of the constraint algebra in equilibrium (reproducing GR) while introducing entropy-sourced secondary constraints in non-equilibrium settings. A full canonical quantization remains beyond the present scope, but this observation demonstrates that the entropic corrections can be embedded consistently within a Hamiltonian structure, ensuring that the theory is not merely phenomenological but dynamically wellfounded.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="14">Reproducibility and Supporting Materials</head><p>The results presented in this manuscript are based on well-defined mathematical derivations and theoretical formulations. The proposed equations and theoretical models are fully reproducible, given the provided derivations. Computational verification of energy-space dynamics and spectral properties can be reproduced using standard numerical solvers for partial differential equations and quantum mechanics. Additionally, experimental tests outlined provide a framework for empirical validation. Further verification can be performed by independent researchers following the methodology described in this work.</p><p>All mathematical derivations, figures, and supporting explanations are included within the main manuscript.</p></div>
