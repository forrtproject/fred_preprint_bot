<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Despite very high rates of suicidality in autistic adults, the key psychosocial drivers of this phenomenon remain unknown. To investigate this, we examined how lifetime stressor exposure and severity, which have been found to predict suicidality in non-autistic populations, related to suicidality in a large, multinational dataset of 226 autistic adults (67% female; Mage = 41.8, SD = 13.6 years, age range = 19-73). Results revealed that autistic men and women differ with respect to the count, severity, and type of stressors they experience over the life course. While autistic men were exposed to more numerous legal/crime-related stressors, autistic women experienced more numerous stressors related to social relationships and chronic humiliation, and typically experienced stressors as more severe. Additionally, we found that whereas chronic interpersonal loss was particularly strongly related to suicidality for men, acute dangerous events, and lower exposure to chronic entrapment, were most strongly related to suicidality in autistic women. These findings indicate that certain stressors may be differentially experienced, and relevant to suicidality, in autistic men versus women.</p><p>They also suggest that screening for lifetime stressor exposure may help identify autistic individuals at greatest risk for suicide.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Lay abstract</head><p>When we encounter life events ('stressors') that we experience as stressful, it sets off a biological stress response which can impact mental health and contribute to suicide risk.</p><p>While we know about specific stressors associated with suicide risk in the general population, little is known about the kinds of stressors which might be related to suicide risk in autistic people, and whether these differ by gender.</p><p>In this study, we compared autistic men and women in their exposure and perception of stressful life events, and looked at relationships between stress and suicide. We combined Australian and UK datasets of 226 autistic adults who had completed the Stress and Adversity Inventory for Adults.</p><p>Autistic men and women differed in their exposure to and perception of stressors. While men experienced more legal/crime-related stressors, women experienced more stressors related to relationships with other people, and more long-lasting stressors associated with humiliation.</p><p>Autistic women often perceived life events as more severe than did men, which is important: perception of life events as stressful is what affects our health. We also found that different stressors may be relevant to suicide in autistic men and women. Loss of loved ones was associated with suicide in men; physically dangerous events were associated with suicide in women. Women with fewer stressors related to feelings of entrapment also had higher suicide rates.</p><p>Further research is needed to confirm these relationships, but they suggest that looking at lifetime stress exposure could be relevant to assessing suicide risk in autistic people.</p><p>A variety of social, psychological, and physical stressors can evoke a psychological and neurobiological stress response that has implications for health. Stressor exposure can incur bodily 'wear and tear' (allostatic load) <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(McEwen, 2005)</ref>, leading to early mortality from a range of chronic and life-threatening conditions, particularly when the stressor is chronic, interpersonal in nature, and early in life <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Johnson et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b112">Shields et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b114">Slavich, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b133">Van Bodegom et al., 2017)</ref>.

In this study, we examined gendered patterns of stressor exposure and perception in a particularly vulnerable group -namely, autistic adults -and investigated potential associations between stressor type and suicidality.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sex and Stress</head><p>Cisgender men and women (henceforth 'men' and 'women') differ in their exposure to lifetime stressors and their perception of the same.

In this context, stressors associated with interpersonal loss (e.g., bereavement, divorce) and humiliation (e.g., bullying, employment issues) have been hypothesized to contribute to the development of thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness <ref type="bibr" target="#b134">(Van Orden et al., 2010)</ref>; stressors associated with pain and danger, as "physically painful and/or emotionally provocative" events <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bender et al., 2011)</ref>, have been proposed to increase suicide capability, as indeed suggested by direct relations between violent (but not non-violent) abuse and suicide attempts <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">(Sachs-Ericsson et al., 2017)</ref>. Moreover, stressors related to role change (e.g., becoming a carer) and, conversely, dependence on others (e.g., needing the support of ageing parents), may be associated with entrapment as a proximal risk factor for suicide <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">(O'Connor &amp; Kirtley, 2018)</ref>. Sociological approaches, too, suggest that the combination of life events and internalized pressures on the individual (such as the gap between reality and their hopes) result in psychological strain, which leads to psychopathology and suicide in those with insufficient social support <ref type="bibr" target="#b144">(Zhang et al., 2020)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Autism and Suicide</head><p>One group at particularly high risk of suicide is autistic people, in whom suicide ideation and attempts are alarmingly common from childhood <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Hedley et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Huntjens et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Newell et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">O'Halloran et al., 2022)</ref>.

To understand this finding, research has focused on risk factors that might be associated with the autistic phenotype, as well as correlates of suicidality that might be more or less prevalent within autistic populations <ref type="bibr">(Hedley &amp; Uljarević, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Hedley et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>First, suicidality in autistic people has been linked to common features of autism, such as cognitive rigidity, insistence on sameness, and emotion regulation difficulties <ref type="bibr">(Conner et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Hedley et al., 2021)</ref>, but also to risk factors from psychological theory, such as thwarted belongingness <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">(Pelton et al., 2020)</ref>, perceived burdensomeness <ref type="bibr">(Moseley et al., 2022a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Pelton et al., 2020)</ref>, and reduced fear of death <ref type="bibr">(Moseley et al., 2022a)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Autism, Stress and Suicide</head><p>Researchers have applied a lifetime stressor exposure framework to suicide in the general population <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Brodsky, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">McFeeters et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b104">Sachs-Ericsson et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b124">Stewart et al., 2019)</ref> and in several clinical or minority groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">(Parra et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b140">Wiebenga et al., 2022)</ref>. However, it remains underutilised in the context of autistic suicidality. In fact, contributions of life stressors to autistic suicidality seem highly probable given higher incidence of adverse childhood experiences <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Hoover &amp; Kaufman, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Kerns et al., 2017)</ref>, and greater likelihood of victimization, exploitation, abuse and assault in adulthood <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Griffiths et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b139">Weiss &amp; Fardella, 2018)</ref>, along with chronic difficulties with employment, finances and housing <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Harmuth et al., 2018)</ref>. While these are instances where activation of the stress response would be clearly expected, recent theoretical work also conceptualizes camouflaging as a chronic stressor which contributes to allostatic load and subsequent burnout and psychopathology <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Mahony &amp; O'Ryan, 2022)</ref>. Impacts of chronic and acute life stressors may be exacerbated, for autistic people, by heightened perception of stressors as stressful <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bishop-Fitzpatrick et al., 2017)</ref>, by difficulties regulating emotions and accessing adaptive coping skills <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Beck et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Muniandy et al., 2022)</ref>, and by social exclusion <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Jones et al., 2021)</ref>. There are indeed associations between autistic suicidality and generic measures of trauma <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">(Pelton et al., 2020)</ref> and painful and provocative events <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Moseley et al., 2023)</ref>. There is also limited empirical work linking adverse childhood experiences and bullying to psychopathology and suicide in autistic people <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Chou et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Holden et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b136">Warrier &amp; Baron-Cohen, 2021)</ref>. Yet, associations between specific stressors, stressortypes and suicidality have been relatively unexplored in autistic people.</p><p>Lifetime stressor exposure might be a particularly useful explanatory framework for disparities in suicide rates among the autistic population. In contrast to the typical preponderence of male suicide deaths <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Ilic &amp; Ilic, 2022)</ref>, suicide risk is greater in autistic women than men <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Lai et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Newell et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b106">Santomauro et al., 2021)</ref>, a finding that may be explained by their higher rates of psychopathology <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Lai et al., 2023)</ref>. Through the lens of lifetime stress, it is notable that autistic men and women are disproportionately exposed to certain stressors; autistic women are more likely to be hospitalized, abused and assaulted <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Gibbs et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b107">Schnabel &amp; Bastow, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b128">Tint et al., 2023)</ref>. Moreover, autistic women tend to perceive stressors as more severe <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(McQuaid, Weiss, et al., 2022)</ref>, as might be expected given greater emotion regulation problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b137">(Weiner et al., 2023)</ref> and greater difficulties accessing healthcare and other forms of support <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Gosling et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Grove et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Miller et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b129">Tint &amp; Weiss, 2018)</ref>.

We used the Kessler 6-item Psychological Distress Inventory (K6; which is provided with the STRAIN) <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Kessler et al., 2003)</ref>, initially as a dependent variable for comparison between groups, and then as a covariate in regression to adjust for the possible influence of current psychopathology.

Subsequently, to examine whether women were exposed to more numerous life stressors and experienced them as more stressful (hypotheses 2 and 3), we compared autistic men and women with respect to lifetime stressor count and perceived stressor severity. The STRAIN categorizes stressors by life domains, and of these, stressors from 8 domains 1 were previously associated with suicidality in autistic people <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Black et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Chou et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Cooper et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Doherty et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr">Hedley, Uljarević, et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Holden et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Pearson et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b138">Weir et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b142">Yew et al., 2021)</ref>. Therefore, this MANOVA included count and perceived severity of stressors related to Work (e.g., being fired or made redundant, struggling to gain employment); Housing (e.g., moving frequently, living in unsafe or poor conditions); Financial (e.g., difficulty covering rent and basic needs); Education (e.g., dropping out, failing exams); Treatment and Health (e.g., being hospitalized, seeking or receiving treatment); Legal/Crime (e.g., being the victim of a crime, being arrested); Marital/Romantic Relationships (e.g., having major fights or chronic conflict); Other Relationships (e.g., being discriminated against or excluded, losing friendships). Some adverse experiences for autistic people operate across multiple life domains and may do so in an enduring manner (e.g., rejection and bullying may occur for autistic people in relation to Education, Work, Other Relationships, Marital/Romantic Relationships) <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Jones et al., 2021)</ref>. In this context, the shared social-psychological characteristics of apparently diverse stressors may be particularly meaningful, as might their nature as acute or chronic <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">(Stewart et al., 2019)</ref>. As such, our second analysis categorised lifetime stressors by their core social-psychological nature and their duration as acute (lasting no more than a few 1 The four remaining stressor domains from the STRAIN include Possessions (e.g., being burgled); Reproductive issues; Death/Bereavement; and Life-Threatening incidents. We did not include these domains because we did not have specific hypotheses about them and/or they overlapped strongly with stressors categorised by social-psychological stressor-type. For instance, stressors categorised within the domain Life-Threatening incidents overlap strongly with those associated with Physical Danger as a social-psychological stressor type, making it redundant to analyse these very similar variables. The same was true for Death/Bereavement and Interpersonal Loss. days) or chronic (lasting at least one month). In this MANOVA, we compared autistic men and women in the count and perceived severity of acute and chronic instances of interpersonal loss (e.g., separation from a partner, bereavement); acute and chronic instances of humiliation (e.g., being fired, bullying); acute and chronic instances of physical danger (e.g., assault, living in unsafe environments); chronic instances of entrapment, which by nature is only chronic (e.g., caregiving responsibilities or financial insecurity); and acute and chronic instances of role change/disruption (e.g., being temporarily disabled by illness, caring for elderly parents).</p></div>

Prior to performing the analyses we mean-centred all variables, confirmed homoscedasticity and normal distributions of residuals, and ensured independence and the absence of multicollinearity between STRAIN variables. To increase robustness of our findings, we used bootstrapping with 5,000 resamples in each regression (providing bias-corrected confidence intervals; BCa 95% CI).</p><p>In the first regression, we modelled site of data collection in block 1, stressors counts for 8 key life domains (Work, Housing, Financial, Education, Treatment/Health, Legal/Crime, Marital/Romantic Relationships, Other Relationships) in block 2, and recent psychopathology (K6 scores) in block 3. While keeping block 1 and block 3 constant, in the second regression we replaced block 2 variables with stressor counts for acute and chronic instances of interpersonal loss, humiliation, physical danger, entrapment, and role change/disruption. In the third regression we replaced block 2 variables with perceived severity of stressors categorised by the 8 life domains above, while keeping blocks 1 and 3 constant. In the fourth regression, we similarly retained block 1 and 3 variables but modelled perceived severity of acute and chronic stressors categorised by social-psychological type. In each instance, SBQ-R scores were modelled as the dependent variable. With regressions stratified by gender, we compared the models using Fisher's z; we additionally report Cohen's q with 95% CI.</p></div>

In relation to lifetime stressor count, with stressors categorised by life domain (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1</ref>, part A), we found that autistic men and women differed significantly in Legal/Crime-related stressor count (higher in men) and Other Relationships stressor count (higher in women); moreover, women tended to perceive Treatment/Health-related stressors and Other Relationship stressors as more severe (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1</ref>, part A, and Table 2, row 1). With acute and chronic stressors categorised by core social-psychological characteristics (Table 2, row 2), autistic women had significantly greater counts of chronic humiliation stressors than autistic men, and perceived these as more severe; they also perceived chronic entrapment stressors as more severe, while not experiencing more of them (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1</ref>, <ref type="figure">part B</ref>).</p><p>[Insert Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">2 about here]</ref> [Insert Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1</ref> about here]</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>In this first multi-national study of stress and suicidality in autistic people, we investigated lifetime stressors associated with suicidality in autistic participants and explored where these patterns differ by gender. Our primary hypothesis was supported; Autistic men and women differed significantly in their exposure to and perceived severity of life stressors. Importantly, while treatment and health-related stressors emerged as a strong predictor of suicidality in autistic men and women, we observed gender differences in the relevance of specific life stressors for suicidality.</p></div>

Since stressor exposure in non-autistic women has been linked to social inequities <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Helpman, 2023)</ref>, the marginalization of autistic people broadly <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Jones et al., 2021)</ref>, in addition to their greater lifetime stressor burden <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Mahony &amp; O'Ryan, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr">Moseley, Turner-Cobb, et al., 2021)</ref>, may be why some gender differences are less apparent, even while others emerge.</p><p>In both autistic and non-autistic samples, subjective perception of life events as stressful mediates the impact of stressor exposure on mental ill-health <ref type="bibr">(Moseley, Turner-Cobb, et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b111">Shields et al., 2023)</ref>. This and other reports <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(McQuaid, Weiss, et al., 2022)</ref> suggest that autistic women may be more likely to perceive, and experience, life events as more stressful than do autistic men. Because greater stressor exposure typically increases the perception of stressors as stressful <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">(Slavich, 2020)</ref>, some instances of higher perceived stress in autistic women could reflect their greater exposure to that stressor -as, for instance, where autistic women had higher stressor count and perceived stress related to other relationships and chronic humiliation. However, there were also some stressors, namely those related to chronic entrapment and treatment/health, which appeared to affect autistic women more severely than autistic men, despite not experiencing more of them. Regardless of whether autistic women actually experience more numerous stressors, the fact of their higher perceived stress, alone, would have highly significant implications for their health.</p><p>Intraindividual differences in stressor perception can be traced back to factors which confer vulnerability and resilience <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">(Shields et al., 2023)</ref>.

Some vulnerability factors, like existing psychopathology and greater difficulties with emotion regulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b137">(Weiner et al., 2023)</ref>, could be related to (on average) longer duration of undiagnosed autism <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Mandy et al., 2022)</ref>.

Although suicidality is typically associated with greater feelings of entrapment <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Li et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">O'Connor &amp; Kirtley, 2018)</ref>, we found that autistic women with lower exposure to and perceived severity of entrapment stressors reported greater suicidality. Chronic by nature, entrapment stressors include such experiences as being a caregiver<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">foot_0</ref> , experiencing overwhelming demands in social, educational, or occupational spheres, and being trapped in unsafe/dissatisfying living circumstances. Although not universally true, it is conceivable that some entrapment stressors are a form of connectedness <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Klonsky &amp; May, 2015)</ref>, either to other people or to a meaningful project, job or role. As per this theory, such connections can keep individuals invested in living when their strength equates or surpasses that of psychological pain and hopelessness. This interpretation is intriguing in relation to our prior study, where examining the UK sample alone revealed that greater entrapment was associated with greater psychopathology (citation redacted). The precise nature of entrapment stressors experienced by our sample is unknown to us, but it is conceivable that some might have deleterious effects on mental health while still functioning as a source of connection. As a putative example, unemployment is linked to suicidality in autistic and non-autistic people alike <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Kolves et al., 2021)</ref>. However, workplace relationships and insufficiently adapted environments also cause considerable stress in autistic people <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Hayward et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b130">Tomczak &amp; Kulikowski, 2023)</ref>, which could explain why employment may not protect autistic people against depression and suicidality in the same way as it does non-autistic people <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Hedley et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Kolves et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b108">Schwartzman &amp; Corbett, 2022)</ref>.</p><p>Employment could therefore be conceived of as an entrapment stressor which, although providing a sense of purpose and/or relationships with other people, also incurs stress and subsequent health impacts. A similar explanation might account for why lower perceived severity of other relationship stressors was associated with greater suicidality in autistic women (albeit not independently of psychopathology). Autistic women tended to experience more such stressors and perceive them as more severe than did autistic men, which would incur allostatic load. However, it is possible that perceiving these stressors as less stressful was indicative of having fewer such connections. Although this interpretation requires further investigation, it would appear consistent with the proposed centrality of social connection and belongingness in suicidality <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Mournet et al., 2023)</ref>, and the problems autistic men and women face when trying to establish such connections <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Grove et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Jones et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b107">Schnabel &amp; Bastow, 2023)</ref>.</p><p>Finally, for autistic women, exposure to and perceived severity of acute physically dangerous stressors were relevant to suicidality over and above psychopathology. Across different frameworks, suicide capability is proposed as a mechanism through which physically painful and/or dangerous experiences can erode evolutionary instincts for selfpreservation <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Klonsky &amp; May, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">O'Connor &amp; Kirtley, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b134">Van Orden et al., 2010)</ref>. This mechanism was supported in autistic people <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Moseley et al., 2023)</ref>, but only partially explains the relation reported elsewhere between traumatic events and suicidality <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">(Pelton et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b136">Warrier &amp; Baron-Cohen, 2021)</ref>. It is possible that post-traumatic sequalae of dangerous stressors might additionally explain this association. Future research should, however, elucidate the timeframe between such events and suicidality, and the mechanisms which might, for some individuals, link the two.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Strengths and Limitations</head><p>Several strengths and limitations of this study should be noted. In terms of strengths, this study is the first to use a multi-national dataset of stressor exposure and perception in a large sample of autistic adults to investigate associations between a wide variety of stressors occurring over the life course and suicidality, which is a critical issue in autistic populations.</p><p>In a statistically robust, hypothesis-driven design, we provide evidence of differential stressor exposure and perception in autistic men and women, and differential relevance of certain life stressors to suicide. There are, however, several limitations that bear remembering. First, the cross-sectional design precludes drawing conclusions about the direction of associations between stressor exposure, stress perception, psychopathology and suicidality--particularly since suicidality can exacerbate or generate psychopathology and interpersonal stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">(O'Connor et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b131">Tong et al., 2021)</ref>. Second, we did not have a non-autistic comparison group. Third, our measurement tools were not specifically designed by or for autistic people; the STRAIN may neglect factors that autistic people find stressful. Fourth, autistic adults with intellectual disabilities were excluded from the study, and thus the sample is not representative of the full autism spectrum. Finally, the exclusion of participants who did not identify as either male or female meant that gender minorities were not included, though their higher rates of suicidality <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Chang et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Newell et al., 2023)</ref> and life adversity <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">(Strang et al., 2021)</ref> suggest the relevance of a stress framework to this group. Other clinicallyrelevant factors to stress and suicide not included here are race and ethnicity <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Ames et al., 2022)</ref>, age at diagnosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Mandy et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Newell et al., 2023</ref>) and age at study participation, given differential importance of life experiences to suicide at varied points of the lifespan <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">(Stewart et al., 2019)</ref>. Indeed, the autistic community are often perceived monolithically as regards their challenges and related suicide risk, but life stages may be highly influential <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Moseley, Druce, et al., 2021)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>In conclusion, this is the first cross-national study to investigate how lifetime stressor exposure and severity relates to suicidality in autistic adults and whether these effects differ for men and women. We found that autistic men and women had different patterns of lifetime stressor count and perceived severity and, in addition, that the effects of these stressors on suicidality differed across these groups. These findings highlight the importance of screening for lifetime stressor exposure when considering suicide risk in autistic individuals, and may also help refine thinking and research on this topic, particularly with respect to understanding key drivers of health disparities in the autistic population.</p></div>

Entrapment is a superordinate category, however, which incorporates stressors across different life domains; the different pattern of relationships supports its distinctiveness from treatment/health-related stressors where both were modelled as predictors.</p></note>
