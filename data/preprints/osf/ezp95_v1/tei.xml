<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The management of water resources and the related disposal of wastewater are essential for human existence and the advancement of contemporary society. Collecting and managing wastewater has a significant effect on local and global economies as well as the environment. Innovation in the field of the environment is of utmost importance in reducing the environmental impacts on systems and in making them more sustainable economically, environmentally and socially. Decentralization is considered an appropriate solution to sustainability problems in liquid waste management programs because it focuses on treating liquid waste on-site, recycling it locally, and taking advantage of the local resources available in domestic wastewater. This research analyzes the needs, appropriate technical methods, and support for water management through decentralized systems. Three considerations will be used to support the choice of a decentralized wastewater treatment system in the Khartoum Locality: $106,000,000. According to the BioWin results, the effectiveness of each alternative household wastewater treatment was comparable. Software such as MapInfo, GPS Area Calculator, BioWin, and GIS was used to reach the targets. Additionally, the results revealed that the decentralized wastewater treatment method, considering its costs, land requirements, and slope effects on the environment, is preferable to centralized wastewater treatment systems. These results serve as a guide for choosing the best wastewater treatment option to increase access to safe sanitation and to integrate decentralized wastewater management to upgrade and improve the environment in the Khartoum Locality.</p></div>

To guarantee appropriate management and accessibility, Article 6 of the Sustainable Development Goals mandates the support and modernization of wastewater treatment systems and sanitation services <ref type="bibr">(UNDP, 2017)</ref>. Urban decay presents sustainability issues, particularly in fast-growing places, such as Khartoum, where access to adequate sanitation is constrained due to a smaller population <ref type="bibr">(UNDP, 2017)</ref>. Goal 6 of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals ("Clean Water and Sanitation") It is expected to achieve passable and justifiable access to hygiene and environmental health services in the year 2030, and at the same time reduce the rate of production of untreated liquid waste by half with the increase in recycling services and safe use at a high level globally, as at the present time there are no less than 1.8 billion The world deals with drinking water sources that are contaminated with human waste, while more than 1.7 billion people live in river basins, and more than 80% of the liquid waste resulting from human activity is disposed of without any treatment <ref type="bibr">(WHO, 2019)</ref>. According to the WHO 2019, 3800 children under the age of five die every day from unhygienic circumstances, inadequate hygiene, and tainted water, with the cost to nations reaching 5% of their GDP, whereas simple sanitation initiatives pay for themselves five times over <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Risch, et al., 2015)</ref>. The gathering and management of liquid waste have a substantial effect on local and global environmental and economic levels (UN, 2022) Owing to limited sanitation and wastewater treatment facilities, Khartoum State faces considerable hurdles in wastewater treatment and environmentally friendly growth <ref type="bibr">(UNEP, 2002)</ref>. Despite the inhabitants' tolerance for septic tanks, World Bank research demonstrates that septic tank discharge in the Khartoum Locality causes water diseases, flies, mosquitoes, and pollutes shallow aquifers. According to Khartoum Locality's 2018 National Environmental Standard, residential BOD emissions were higher than the national average. Given that 26% and 46% of the world's population lack access to clean water and sanitary facilities, respectively, these necessities are essential for promoting public health <ref type="bibr">(CBS, 2018)</ref>. Decentralization is becoming more popular in outlying areas as cities relocate to the countryside, feeding 25% of the US population more than ten years ago, while also facilitating future growth (Ministry of Irrigation, 2013) Sudanese officials are hesitant to discharge treated wastewater into the Nile River <ref type="bibr">(Jones, et al, 2012)</ref>. despite their technical feasibility. There is a scarcity of water resources in North Africa and the Middle Eastern countries. There is an immense need to reuse wastewater after adequate treatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(El Moll, 2023)</ref>. The collection of wastewater significantly influences the environment both globally and locally. One solution to achieve sustainability is the decentralization of wastewater management <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Capdaglio, 2017)</ref>. Scarce empirical evidence is available on the decentralization of wastewater management in Khartoum, Sudan. Originality and novelty lie in improving the environment and attaining sustainability in terms of economic, environmental, and social terms, as well as environmental health. This is one of the pioneer studies which has contributed towards water management of decentralized system in Sudan. This study aimed to enhance water and human health protection in Khartoum.</p></div>

While the laws are the same in Europe and the US, they differ in other countries, such as India. While the European and American regulations are 15 mg/L, Western countries recommend a BOD5 value of 25 mg/L for water before it is dumped into rivers.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p>Our study shows replicated sewage BOD, COD, and TSS concentrations in the two wastewater treatment models. The three wastewater flow parameter limitations for controlling domestic wastewater release were BOD: 15 mg/L, COD: 75 mg/L, and TSS: 30 mg/L. Therefore, none of the focuses met the Khartoum local water pollution standards for domestic wastewater and Khartoum local control standards for domestic wastewater. In terms of the flatness of the land, it tends to the north, that is, at the level of the Nile, and this reduces the cost of construction at the level of the sewage network, land requirements, there are open spaces and public areas within the Khartoum locality, which must be irrigated with treated wastewater. Although the methods now adapted for individual services have contributed to significant development in public health, sustainable solutions remain a requirement in light of the increasing need for resources due to the increase in population <ref type="bibr">(Ma, et al,2017</ref><ref type="bibr">. US EPA 1997)</ref>.</p><p>Liquid waste is classified into four types of services according to the primitive classification of water management, each of which is managed according to specific rules and depends on the others. By assessing complex water issues in an integrated manner, any comprehensive water system can be sustainable and balanced with local economic and environmental services <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Massoud, et at. 2009)</ref>. The importance of central water systems lies in unification, which allows them to meet the needs of water and quality standards on a large scale. They are also subject to a certain degree of financial, organizational, and technical stagnation. Studies on acute water shortages and related factors have focused on water reuse.</p><p>It is difficult to benefit from treated water in the case of a central sewage treatment system due to the increased operational cost, because the central treatment plants are outside the region, while it is possible to benefit from it in the case of a decentralized system. Discharging treated water in excess of the region's needs into the Nile River and its tributaries. But in terms of cost, the decentralized system appears less expensive, so it is easier to implement, while the centralized system shows high cost. There are great benefits the decentralized infrastructure can provide by spreading the risks of drought and miasma between deferent locations.</p><p>The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has recognized that "decentralized wastewater systems may provide a cost-effective and long-term option for meeting public health and water quality goals, particularly in less densely populated areas" <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Tchobanoglous, et al, 2003)</ref>. According to the questionnaire (trying to find solutions to the sewage problem in Khartoum State), 79.4 % of the population rejects the establishment of a sewage station in the neighborhoods, while 20.6 % agree. To establish a sewage plant in the neighborhood. Therefore, the government must intervene and solve the problem in accordance with the higher interests of the region. The sultan in Khartoum wants open spaces and streets to be green, but this cannot be achieved unless the system is decentralized. The decentralization option relates to several matters considered important, such as planning and decision-making, for example. In practical terms, it can enhance the role of citizens and be a means of resolving local environmental and health concerns accurately, and it may also help improve services <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Burton, et al, 2013</ref>). The decentralized system often tends to meet the needs of local water use, as treated water helps increase agricultural productivity and is also suitable as an alternative to landscaping and replenishing groundwater resources (Environs Associates, 2018).</p><p>There are advantages of systems. On the other hand, there are disadvantages as well. In a centralized water system there is uniformity, and it assures the demand and quality standard of the population. Due to shortages of water resources and other related factors, communities insisted on paying adequate attention to using water. In addition, decentralized water system can spread a high risk of drought in the locality. In a decentralized water system, local water reuse could be used to increase agricultural productivity. Decentralization is a holistic method. It helps the locality to reduce waste of water, helps recycling, and also helps to keep the wastewater collection component at the minimum level. Decentralization method help to reduce the cost by 60% as com-pared to centralized method of water management, thus helping in obtaining sustain-ability and improving environmental health.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusion</head><p>This study evaluated a wastewater decentralized treatment system in Khartoum Locality, focusing on stabilization ponds and MPR technologies. The decentralized stations were found most suitable for urban liquid waste management. The study used wastewater engineering calculations, BioWin simulations, and Excel analysis to evaluate sanitation and wastewater treatment development. The study highlights the importance of considering other factors like sludge management, transportation, effluent discharge, and economic costs for installation, operation, and maintenance. The study emphasizes the need for expert and government opinions in wastewater treatment selection.</p><p>The current study has discussed in detail the decentralization method of water management, its benefits and disadvantages. Decentralization method help to improve environmental health, agricultural productivity, reduce cost and help in obtaining sustainability. Due to drought risk, the decentralization method of water management is attracting the attention of researchers and practitioners. Reuse of water not only reduces the cost but also decreases the demand for chemical fertilizers for the agricultural sector. Treated water also helps in the reduction of water crises such as wastewater pollution and lack of water in Khartoum locality, Sudan.
