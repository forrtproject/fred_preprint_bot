<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The volume and complexity of biological data have significantly increased in recent years, often represented as network models continue to increase at a rapid pace. However, drug discovery in the context of complex phenotypes are hampered by the difficulties inherent in producing machine learning algorithms that can integrate molecular-genetic, biochemical, physiological, and other diverse datasets. Recent developments have expanded network analysis techniques, such as network embedding, to effectively explore multilayer network structures. Multilayer networks, which incorporate various nodes and connections in formats such as multiplex, heterogeneous, and bipartite networks, provide an effective framework for merging diverse and multi-scale biological data sources. However, current network embedding methods face challenges and limitations in addressing the heterogeneity and diversity of these networks. Therefore, there is an essential need for the development of new network embedding methods to manage the complexity and diversity of multi-omics biological information effectively. Here, we report a universal multilayer network embedding method MultiXVERSE, which is to the best of our knowledge the first one capable of handling any kind of multilayer network. We applied it to a moleculardrug-disease multiplex-heterogeneous network. Our model made new predictions about a link between GABA and cancer that we verified experimentally in the Xenopus laevis model.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Network graph models are highly effective for depicting real-world objects through their relationships and interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. They offer valuable insights into the connections between different entities and are utilized as tools to investigate complex systems across various fields <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref>. A significant challenge in machine learning involves converting high-dimensional graph-based data into a feature vector. Indeed, these methods were originally designed for vector data and cannot be directly applied to biological datasets such as biological networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref>. Network embedding, also known as graph representation learning, addresses this issue by transforming network data into formats compatible with conventional machine learning tools, thereby broadening the scope of machine learning applications in network analysis.</p><p>Network embedding techniques have proven highly effective across numerous applications, including community detection, node classification, and link prediction. Capable of handling vast networks with millions of nodes, these techniques are particularly valuable in the era of big data. Consequently, network embeddings are increasingly used to analyze various large-scale networks, such as social <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, neuronal <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> or molecular networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>.</p><p>The volume and complexity of biological data have significantly increased in recent years, often represented as multilayer network models <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>. Multilayer networks, which incorporate various nodes and connections in formats such as multiplex, heterogeneous, and bipartite networks, provide an especially effective framework for merging diverse and multi-scale biological data sources <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>. However, current network embedding methods face challenges and limitations in addressing the heterogeneity and diversity of these networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Therefore, there is an essential need for the development of new network embedding methods to manage the complexity and diversity of multilayer networks effectively.</p><p>In this work, we extended MultiVERSE <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, a multilayer network embedding algorithm tailored for the application of machine learning techniques to these multilayer networks but limited to a maximum of two multiplex networks. MultiVERSE is based on the VERSE framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, and coupled with Random Walks with Restart (RWR) on multilayer networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Recently, RWR has been extended to a universal random walk with restart using a method called MultiXrank <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> allowing the exploration of any kind of multilayer networks. We extended MultiVERSE with MultiXrank and it is now a universal multilayer network embedding method that we named MultiXVERSE. Our method can handle any multilayer network defined as a composition of various multiplex and monoplex networks interconnected through bipartite interaction networks (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> for an example). Within this multilayer structure, each network may also be weighted and/or directed. And we can add as many multiplex and bipartite networks as we want with this extension without limitations, except of course computational power.</p><p>Consequently, MultiXVERSE provides a means to network embedding on these multilayer networks, which are characterized by their rich and complex interactions. This approach is particularly effective in representing the multi-scale interactions typically observed in biological systems. For biology, this approach allows to aggregate network data from drugs, diseases, genes, patients etc... in the same network representation and machine learning can be applied on the resulting embeddings for a wide variety of application including drug repositioning, new predicted gene-disease or drug-target links, the discovery of specific biological functional modules for diseases integrating genes and drugs etc... To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time that network embedding can be applied to any kind of multilayer networks without any limitations on the number of multiplex networks or the type of neworks (weighted, directed, undirected) .</p><p>In this article, we applied MultiXVERSE to a biological multilayer network containing data on gene, drug, and diseases interactions and evaluated the quality of the embedding using link prediction (a standard approach in multilayer network embedding <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>). Second, we clustered the embeddings to find functional biological modules, which revealed new predictions of Each of these multiplex networks consists of various types of nodes, squares are genes, circles are drugs and triangles are diseases. They are interconnected through three bipartite networks (gene-disease, drug-target and drug-disease), which are visualized here as bipartite interactions for clarity. The number of multiplex networks and layers inside the multiplex networks is arbitrary and could be more.</p><p>a link between GABA and cancer. Third, we applied link prediction on the embeddings of GABA agonists drugs and found new links between GABA receptors and cancer. Neurotransmitters are emerging targets in cancer <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref> and as such is a case study particularly suited for evaluating our system. Finally, we experimentally tested the new prediction of GABA as a potential cause of cancer in a tadpole melanocyte model, and validated the prediction linking GABA-modulating drugs to a cancer-like phenotype in the absence of classic carcinogens, oncogenes, or DNA damage as the initiator of cellular conversion.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">MultiXVERSE: a universal multilayer network embedding</head><p>We extended MultiVERSE <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> to MultiXVERSE for universal multilayer network embedding . This method computes the similarities between nodes using random walks with restart on any kind of multilayer network <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> and optimizes the embeddings using Kullback-Leibler minimization. We present the general method of MultiXVERSE in this section.</p><p>Within the MultiXVERSE framework, it is necessary to formulate a similarity metric for the multiplex-heterogeneous network, designated as G M H . This metric, denoted sim G : V M H × V M H → R, maps pairs of nodes within V M H to a real number, reflecting their level of similarity. It is defined as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">∀v ∈ V M H , u∈V sim G (v, u) = 1 .<label>(1)</label></formula><p>Hence, sim G (v, .), which signifies the similarity metric for any given node v within the multiplex-heterogeneous network G M H , is conceptualized as a probability distribution. Given that, one can obtain the normalized similarity distribution within the embedding space by applying the softmax function. Formally, let w i represent the embedding of node i within this space. Consequently, the similarity between the embeddings of two nodes w u and w v is characterized by the dot product w u • w T v , yielding the following expression:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">sim Emb (v, .) = exp(w v • w T ) n i=1 exp(w v • w i ) . (<label>2</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">)</formula><p>The purpose of MultiXVERSE is to closely estimate the similarity distribution within the embedding space, represented as sim Emb :</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">V M H × V M H → R, such that for all v in V M H , the relationship sim G (v, .</formula><p>) is approximated by sim Emb (v, .). The optimization during the learning phase is executed through the minimization of the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the two similarity measures:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">v∈V M KL(sim G (v, .) ∥ sim Emb (v, .))<label>(3)</label></formula><p>By keeping only the terms related to sim Emb as sim G is constant, we derive the objective function as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">L = - v∈V M sim G (v, .) log(sim Emb (v, .))<label>(4)</label></formula><p>At each iteration, since sim Emb is constructed as a softmax function, it necessitates normalization across the entire network's nodes, a process that is computationally intensive. Analogous to the methodologies employed in the original MultiVERSE and VERSE algorithms, Noise Contrastive Estimation (NCE) is utilized to approximate these computations <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</p><p>To sum up, in this framework, the similarity in the multiplex-heterogenous network is computed using MultiXrank <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. And MultiXVERSE applies Kullback-Leibler minimization to optimize the embeddings. The parameters for random walks with restart on the multilayer networks are the following:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">r = 0.7, η = 1 3 , 1 3 , 1 3 , λ =   1 3 1 3 1 3 1 3 1 3 1 3 1 3 1 3 1 3   , δ 1 = 0.5, δ 2 = 0.5, δ 3 = 0.5. and τ = 1 3 1 3 1 3 , 1 2 1 2 , 1 4 1 4 1 4 1 4</formula><p>. The reader can refer to the original article for more details on the method and particular implementation of the algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.1">Datasets for the gene-drug-disease multilayer network</head><p>We used several different datasets to construct the multiplex-heterogeneous network, which we constructed to be composed of one human molecular multiplex network (3 layers), one drug multiplex network (4 layers) and one disease monoplex network. The multiplex networks are linked by 3 bipartite networks: drug-disease, gene-disease, and drug-target networks.</p><p>The multiplex networks are the following:</p><p>• Human molecular multiplex network: This network is a molecular network, extracted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, composed of 3 layers:</p><p>1. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) layer which integrates 4 datasets: Hi-Union, APID (apid.dep.usal.es) (Level 2, human only), Lit-BM (http://www.interactome-atlas.org/ download).</p><p>2. The second layer is a pathways layer constructed from the human Reactome data <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> extracted from NDEx <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</p><p>3. This last layer is a molecular complexes layer corresponding to the fusion of Hu.map <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> and Corum <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</p><p>• Drug multiplex network: The multiplex drug network integrates several sources and interaction types and has been extracted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Data is derived from Cheng et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> and the pharmacological drugs interaction network available at snap.stanford.edu were utilized. In this network, drugs are named according to DrugBank conventions, encompassing both the multiplex network and its associated bipartite networks:</p><p>1. The first layer corresponds to clinical drug interactions. It includes 14,822 clinically reported adverse drug-drug interactions among 667 drugs.</p><p>2. The second is the experimental drug combinations layer. It contains 737 experimentally validated drug combinations involving 376 drugs.</p><p>3. The third represents the predicted drug combinations and includes 2,080 networkpredicted combinations for hypertensive drugs, covering 65 different drugs.</p><p>4. The last layer of the drug multiplex network includes the pharmacologic drug-drug interactions and consists of 48,514 interactions determined by the pharmacological effects of one drug on another, involving 1,514 drugs.</p><p>• Disease network: The Disease multiplex network (DIS) has been structured into two layers, each representing different aspects of disease relationships:</p><p>1. Disease-Disease Network Based on Shared Symptoms: Originating from a bipartite disease-symptoms network, this layer forms connections based on the cosine distance between diseases, retaining all interactions where this distance is above 0.5, indicating significant symptom overlap.</p><p>2. Comorbidity Network: This layer integrates epidemiological data to illustrate the comorbidity relationships among diseases, highlighting epidemiological correlations.</p><p>Each layer provides a unique perspective on disease interactions, encompassing treatment similarities, symptom relationships, and epidemiological data. .</p><p>The bipartite networks are:</p><p>• Gene-Disease Network: We extracted the curated gene-disease bipartite network from the DisGeNET database in order to connect the two molecular and disease multiplex networks.</p><p>• Drug-target Network: This network combines drug-target associations from multiple sources including DrugBank Release Version 5.1.8 (accessible at https://go.drugbank. com/releases/latest), DrugCentral release v10.12 (available at https://drugcentral.org/ download), and associations described by Cheng et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</p><p>• Disease-Drug Network: The associations between diseases and drugs are obtained from the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.2">Evaluation of the approach</head><p>Link prediction Like previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref>, we employed link prediction to assess the efficacy of our embeddings and validate our universal multilayer network embedding method for network biology and medicine. Our link prediction methodology entails initially removing 30% of bipartite edges randomly in each bipartite networks to form a training multilayer network. Subsequently, we employ a Random Forest classifier to this training network, as described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, and perform evaluations on a withheld subset consisting of 30% of the edges. The binary classifier's training method includes the utilization of various operators on the node embeddings. These operators comprise Hadamard, Weighted-L1, Weighted-L2, Average, and cosine. The objective of this validation method is to ascertain the quality of the embeddings in the discovery of novel drug-gene-disease associations. At present, conducting direct comparative analyses with alternative methodologies is not practicable due to the unique nature of the embedding process for multilayer networks with three distinct node types from 3 differents multiplex networks, a feature not yet paralleled in the existing literature.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Case study on cancer and neurotransmitters</head><p>The second approach we used for validation is to test the method on a case study, here the to assess the link between neurotransmitter and cancer <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref>. Serotonin has already been linked to cancer <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref> and we want to know if other neurotransmitters may be predicted by our model which could lead to the discovery of new targets and drug repositioning for cancer.</p><p>In order to test our system on these new results, we focused on biological modules. Once MultiXVERSE has been applied to the drug-disease-gene multilayer network, we used a clustering method on the embeddings and analyzed the clusters. The clustering method we applied is spherical k-means <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> with k = 500 applied on the embedding.</p><p>We then applied link prediction to GABA agonist drugs using a Random Forest classifier with the operator 'Average'.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.2">Consistency of MultiXVERSE with MultiVERSE results on the progeria cluster</head><p>To assess the quality of the clustering of our embeddings, we analyzed the progeria cluster similarly to <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A</ref>). Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome (HGPS) is a rare genetic disorder that causes premature aging. It is characterized by symptoms such as slowed postnatal growth, facial structural abnormalities, premature cardiovascular diseases, lipodystrophy, hair loss, and widespread osteodysplasia. HGPS arises from mutations in the LMNA genes, leading to the production of a deleterious version of the Lamin A protein, known as Progerin.</p><p>The results are similar to those obtained with MultiVERSE: LMNA and HGPS were both found to be associated. We found several genes in both cluster including ZMPSTE24 in the cluster that is associated to accelerated aging in the literature and LMNA <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref>, but also LEMD2, RGS18, MARVELD1, KCNK13, IZUMO2, PERM1, LINC01857, and KIF12n. The cluster share diseases to including muscular dystrophy, the Werner syndrome (the adult premature aging syndrome), deformities of the hand and foot and cardiac disease associated to progeria <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>.</p><p>KCNK13 is an especially interesting gene and encodes a K + potassium ion channel (Potassium Two Pore Domain Channel Subfamily K Member 13). It is related to the Birk-Barel syndrome (BIBARS) -a rare genetic disorder characterized by motor and speech delay, impaired intellectual development, early feeding difficulties, muscular hypotonia, hyperactivity, aggression, and facial dysmorphism. This syndrome shares part of its phenotype with HGPS. HGPS has also been related to bioelectricity <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> which can fall in the context of aging (or premature aging) as a channelopathy <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>.</p><p>Therefore, we conclude that we have similar results to the previous version of MultiVERSE <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, even if we have more multiplex and bipartite networks (MultiVERSE has been applied on a gene-disease mutilayer network) and a different set of networks, showing a good robustness to the integration of new data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.3">The clustering of the embeddings shows serotonin and GABA pathways linked to cancer and developmental disorder</head><p>In order to learn more about the link between cancer, developmental disorders and neurotransmitters <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref>, we analyzed the different clusters integrating those three components. We found that several clusters show a link between neurotransmitters including GABA and serotonin with cancer of malformations. One cluster (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3B</ref>) includes EPO and Darbepoetin alpha. Recombinant human erythropoietin is commonly used in clinical settings to treat anemia associated with cancer and chemotherapy. However, recent clinical trials indicate that rhEPO might also negatively affect disease progression and patient survival <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. Interestingly, EPO is known to increase GABA currents <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> suggesting an implication of GABA neurotransmitter in the adverse effect of EPO in cancer development.</p><p>A second cluster is linking developmental disorders, neurotransmitter drugs (gabapentin with lamotrigine) with serotonin syndrome and large cell carcinomas (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3C</ref>). Gabapentin is a structural analogue of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. Lamotrigine is an anti-glutamate agent and may enhance GABAergic transmission <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>.

One type of cancer that is especially readily investigated in frog embryos is the conversion of melanocytes, from normal pigment cells to a hyper-proliferative, invasive melanoma-like phenotype <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48]</ref>. In order to perturb GABA signaling, we used muscimol -a well-known GABA agonist <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53]</ref>. Muscimol itself is not in the original data we used in our model but it is a GABA(A) agonist like Progabide <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">55]</ref> that was found in the link prediction (see above), enabling us to test the utility of the model's categorical predictions for novel drugs that it did not have direct experience with. Fifty Xenopus embryos were exposed to 50 mM muscimol between the stage 12 to st. 45 (after completion of gastrulation through swimming tadpole stages), and then sectioned. The results are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>. In contrast to controls, all of the exposed animals exhibited a drastic hyperpigmentation due to the melanocytes' changing shape (from their normal round form to a much more elongated morphology), and migrating into inappropriate regions that are normally clear. This phenotype has previously been characterized quantitatively with respect to melanocyte shape and number, as well as the expression of cancer-related markers and melanoma-like migration into gut, brain, and vascular tissues <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48]</ref>. These results confirm the prediction of the model and link GABA-modulating drugs to a cancer-like phenotype in the absence of classic carcinogens, oncogenes, or DNA damage as the initiator of cellular conversion. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Discussion</head><p>In this work, we presented what is, to the best of our knowledge the first universal multiplayer network embedding method with no limitations on number of multiplex and bipartite networks thanks to recent developments in RWR <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. We applied MultiXVERSE to a multilayer network containing gene, drug, and diseases interactions and evaluated the quality of the embedding using both clustering and link prediction to demonstrate the quality of the embeddings. Our model predicted links between cancer, serotonin, and GABA via clustering. The serotonin link has been validated by published data <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref>. Next, we tested the new prediction from clustering between GABA and cancer using link prediction and found again predictions between GABA agonists and cancer. Finally, we tested this new prediction experimentally and confirmed the ability of GABA-modulating drugs to induce a cancer-like phenotype in a vertebrate model system in vivo, in the absence of classic carcinogens, oncogenes, or DNA damage as the initiator of cellular conversion. These kinds of data have important implications for understanding of cancer etiology and possible normalization <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">57,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">58]</ref> efforts using neurotransmitter modulators, and need to be tested in preclinical mammalian models next.</p><p>Our main domain of application here was drug discovery for cancer but the embeddings of a gene-drug-disease multilayer networks may be used for many other applications. Different questions in network biology could be addressed, by finding new genes related to specific diseases, such as the interesting target -the ion channel KCNK13 -revealed by our case study on the progeria cluster. This may be especially relevant due to the recent hypotheses about the role of bioelectric signaling in aging <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">59,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">60]</ref>. We also applied link prediction for different drug-disease associations. Our method for drug repurposing has currently one significant limitation: in the case of new drug-target predictions, we don't know if the drug will activate or inactivate the target. This may be resolved by using directed networks in the multiplex networks and training link prediction models on the embedding integrating the directional information of the links.</p><p>Our system revealed predicted a causal link between GABA and cancer development that we validated experimentally in a vertebrate model system in vivo. This link has been studied before and it has been found that GABA has a driver role in controlling stem and proliferative cell state through GHB production in glioma <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref>. It has been reported too that membrane potential differences and GABA(A) receptor expression in hepatic tumor versus non-tumor stem cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref>. However, contradictory evidences has been reported showing that GABA could have an inhibitory effect on tumor progression or cell proliferation <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">64]</ref>. Consequently, more research is necessary to understand the impact of GABA on cancer.</p><p>To improve the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in processing text-enriched images, researchers have developed embeddings specifically designed to capture image contexts. These embeddings are integrated as soft prompt inputs in LLMs, enhancing the models' ability to effectively handle visual information <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref>. Similarly, we could use the node embeddings as input to use the power of LLMs for generative drug discovery including the richness of multiplex-heterogeneous network biological data. One relevant effort that can be integrated into this framework in the future is the bioinformatics of shape, which seeks to formalize and make amenable to machine learning data on large-scale anatomical outcomes in embryogenesis, regeneration, cancer, and bioengineering <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">67]</ref>. We expect that future systems that combine pattern inference with diverse multi-modal datasets, comprising physiological, anatomical, and molecular-biological data will be a critical aid to human scientists and clinicians seeking to develop interventions for a wide range of biomedical applications.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: A universal multilayer network consisting of 3 distinct multiplex networks (gene, drig and disease), each represented by different colors (yellow, purple, and blue).Each of these multiplex networks consists of various types of nodes, squares are genes, circles are drugs and triangles are diseases.
