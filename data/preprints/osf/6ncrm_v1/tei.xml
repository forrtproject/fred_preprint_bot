<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Mental time travel utilizes mental imagery to recollect past experiences and to prospect hypothetical future events. This elicits anticipatory affect responses that are pivotal to motivate goal-directed behavior towards pleasurable and away from threatening experiences. However, the temporal dynamics of neural, physiological and affective processing of mental time travel remain elusive. Here, we aimed to examine the Late Positive Potential (LPP), skin conductance responses (SCR) and behavioral affect ratings in response to mental time travel through emotionally salient experiences. Forty-eight participants (52% females) viewed 16 neutral, positive, and negative stimuli from the International Affective Picture System ('encoding task'). Participants then imagined each stimulus as vividly as possible ('recall task') and experiencing each situation after leaving the laboratory ('prospection task'). Results showed significantly potentiated electrocortical activity in the LPP in response to recalling negative and prospecting positive stimuli. Behavioral ratings also showed a significant potentiation of self-reported positive and negative affect and arousal in response to both recalling and prospecting positive as well as negative stimuli. SCR amplitudes were not significantly associated with recalling or prospecting these experiences. Our findings suggest that the retrieval and prospection of emotionally salient experiences are associated with neural anticipatory responses in the LPP. This could reflect a neural mechanism that facilitates affective responses to mental representations of emotional stimuli, thereby guiding goal-directed behavior.</p><p>Future studies should compare clinical to non-clinical groups in this context to illuminate the mechanisms of aberrant mental time travel and emotional disturbances in psychopathology.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Mental time travel encompasses an individual's capacity to recall past events and to project themselves into the future <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Addis, 2020)</ref>. This cognitive process relies on mental imagery, defined as mental representations and the accompanying experience of sensory information without a direct external stimulus <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Pearson et al., 2015)</ref>. Drawing on past experiences, mental imagery allows individuals to simulate hypothetical future scenarios and thereby to anticipate potential outcomes such as reward and threat <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Schacter et al., 2017)</ref>. This elicits an anticipatory affect response that is pivotal for survival and life satisfaction. Anticipatory affect carries information about whether to approach pleasurable and rewarding stimuli or to avoid threats, thereby guiding decision-making and goal-directed behavior, even in the absence of immediate stimuli or sensory input <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Lang &amp; Bradley, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Pearson, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Wilson &amp; Gilbert, 2003)</ref>.</p><p>Dysfunctions in mental imagery are common in various mental health conditions (for a review: <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Ji et al., 2019)</ref>. For example, major depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, and acute psychotic episodes are often associated with inflexibly persistent, intrusive, and extremely vivid distressing negative mental imagery. Reduced quality of positive mental imagery, in turn, is associated with amotivational psychopathology such as anhedonia and avolition, and low psychological well-being <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Blackwell, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Hallford et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Pillny et al., 2024)</ref>. These aberrancies in mental imagery may be fundamental to dysfunctional anticipatory affect and could thereby explain behavioral problems in psychopathology such as dysfunctional avoidance or attenuated reward seeking behavior. However, the neurocognitive mechanisms underlying the link between mental imagery and anticipatory affect in both healthy and clinical populations remain largely elusive.</p><p>Neuroimaging research suggests that during mental imagery, episodic memories are reactivated by a top-down process and maintained as mental representations in working memory, where they modulate neural, physiological, and affective responses, similar to the perception of original stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Ji et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Kosslyn et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Schacter &amp; Addis, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Schacter et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Indeed, studies show similar patterns of neural activation in the medial temporal, prefrontal, parietal, and occipital lobes of healthy individuals when recalling past events and prospecting future scenarios (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Bellana et al., 2017)</ref>. This indicates that mental imagery activates a network of brain structures that are associated with memory and perceptual processing of sensory input and could explain the significant association between memory impairment and psychopathology (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Pillny et al., 2022)</ref>. While neuroimaging studies are well suited to localize the brain structures involved neural processing of mental representations, they offer little insight into the temporal dynamics of neural and physiological processes associated with mental imagery and anticipatory affect.</p><p>In contrast, event-related potentials (ERPs) and skin conductance responses (SCRs) are valuable tools for examining the temporal dynamics of neural and physiological processes and allow to disentangle the overlap between attention, memory and affective responses. The late positive potential (LPP) is an ERP that has been extensively investigated as a neural marker of heightened attention and cognitive processing to emotional and motivationally salient stimuli in both nonclinical (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Paul et al., 2016)</ref> and clinical populations (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Clayson et al., 2022)</ref>. The LPP can be observed approximately 300-400 ms after stimulus onset and reflects a sustained positive deflection that is larger in response to positive and negative stimuli than to neutral stimuli at predominantly centroparietal electrodes <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Keil et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Luck &amp; Kappenman, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Schupp et al., 2003)</ref>. Previous research using combined functional magnetic resonance imaging and EEG indicated that the LPP is generated and modulated by a neural network composed of both cortical and subcortical structures associated with visual and emotional processing such as the amygdala and the visual cortex (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Liu et al., 2012)</ref>. The LPP is therefore thought to reflect attention allocation, cognitive elaboration, and emotional processing of intrinsically motivating information <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Hajcak et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Weinberg &amp; Hajcak, 2010)</ref> and has also been found to be associated with autonomic and self-reported indices of arousal <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Cuthbert et al., 2000)</ref>. Similarly, the SCR is referred to as an indirect measure of sympathetic autonomic activity and has been found to be associated with both emotional reactivity and attention (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Critchley, 2002)</ref>. The SCR reflects an elevated sympathetic activation, which increases the conductivity of the skin <ref type="bibr">(Dawson et al., 2000)</ref>. These phasic changes in electrical conductivity of the skin can be triggered by sustained attention and processing of motivationally salient stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Bradley et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Dawson et al., 2017)</ref>. However, there is a paucity of research investigating whether the LPP and SCR can index anticipatory affect responses to mental time travel through emotionally relevant experiences. This would have implications for our understanding of how past and future events influence current emotional states and how aberrant mental imagery translates into emotional disorders, and particularly anhedonia.</p><p>In fact, initial evidence suggests that both the LPP and the SCR can be modulated by imagined and anticipatory processes. In healthy individuals, potentiated LPP amplitudes have been found to reward predicting cues in reward learning tasks (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Glazer et al., 2018)</ref>, when asked to recall arousing details of previously presented threatening stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Thiruchselvam et al., 2012)</ref>, to recall previously presented angry and happy faces <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Suess &amp; Abdel Rahman, 2015)</ref>, to imagine previously presented positive photographs <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Jackson et al., 2024)</ref>, and to imagine negative scenes after listening to an audio description of these scenes <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(MacNamara, 2018)</ref>. Similarly, increased SCRs have been observed during reward (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Agren et al., 2019)</ref> and threat (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Davies &amp; Craske, 2015)</ref> anticipation in healthy individuals. One important study has explored LPP responses in the context of mental time travel <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Speed et al., 2020)</ref>. This study demonstrated that when healthy participants recalled negative autobiographical experiences, prompted by individualized cue words, their LPP responses were potentiated compared to recalling neutral cues. While Speed et al. provided a sound rationale for individualizing their experimental design (i.e., each participant received individual prompts to recall individual autobiographical events), this approach does not allow for a direct comparison between subjects. Although this was not a concern in the study by <ref type="bibr">Speed et al.</ref>, it poses a challenge for future research comparing clinical and non-clinical groups. Clinical samples may tend to recall negative experiences more readily, potentially due to greater exposure to social adversity <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Jaya &amp; Lincoln, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Pillny &amp; Lincoln, 2020)</ref>. Also, the fact that each participant will imagine individual events is an obstacle to between-subject comparability in general. Lastly, given that attenuated LPP responses to positive stimuli are discussed as a neural marker for amotivational psychopathology such as anhedonia <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Weinberg, 2023)</ref> and that the prospection of future experiences is likely to be particularly relevant for motivational processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Gilbert &amp; Wilson, 2007)</ref>, it is crucial to compare positive and negative experiences during both recall and prospection. The lack of standardized experimental tasks to objectively investigate anticipatory affective responses to mental time travel may have precluded prior research from conducting such studies.</p><p>The current study set out to develop a standardized experimental paradigm and to investigate anticipatory affect responses to mental imagery during mental time travel through positive and negative 'autobiographical' experiences in healthy participants from the general population. We hypothesized that, compared to recalling and prospecting neutral experiences, recalling and prospecting positive and negative experiences would elicit potentiated anticipatory responses in LPP and SCR amplitudes as well as in behavioral ratings of arousal, pleasantness, and unpleasantness.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Transparency and Openness</head><p>We report how we determined the sample size, data exclusion, manipulations, and measures in the experiment. The experiment was preregistered prior to data collection. The study protocol, data, analysis code, and materials are publicly available on Open Science Framework (LINK WILL BE REVEALED AFTER PEER-REVIEW). All experimental procedures were approved by the local ethics committee of Universität Hamburg (Az: 2022_025).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>An a priori sample size calculation was performed using the Power Contour Estimation Algorithm for experimental psychology and human neuroscience <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Baker et al., 2021)</ref>. Since studies on LPP responses during mental time travel are scarce, and the long-term aim was to develop a standardized procedure for comparing LPP responses between clinical and control groups, the effect-size estimation was based on a study comparing LPP amplitudes in response to positive, negative, and neutral stimuli in people with schizophrenia compared with healthy controls <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Horan et al., 2010)</ref>. Assuming a pooled within-person mean difference of 1.62 (SDpooled = 3.99) in LPP responses to positive, negative, and neutral stimuli, and using α = .05, β = .80, and k = 48 trials, an optimal sample size of N = 48 was determined. We considered the results of Horan et al. to provide the more reliable and conservative estimate, as Speed et al. recruited only healthy psychology students and did not include positive stimuli, which may explain the relatively larger effect in their study (mean within-person difference of 2.72; SDpooled = 6.32).</p><p>Fifty-four participants were recruited from the general population via online advertisements. Inclusion criteria were age (ranged between 18 and 60 years), vision (normal or corrected-to-normal), and language (sufficient German language skills to provide written informed consent). Individuals with left-or both-handedness, a history of a neurological disorder or a current DSM-5 diagnosis (established with the Mini Diagnostic Interview for Mental Disorders -Open Access; <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Margraf et al., 2017)</ref> were excluded from participation. Of the 54 recruited individuals, four met DSM-5 criteria for a mental disorder and were excluded from participation. Two subjects withdrew from participation after informed consent had been provided and two further participants had incomplete EEG data due to technical problems with the EEG recording, resulting in a final sample of N = 48 participants (52% identifying as female). The final sample had a mean age of 32.17 years (SD = 9.08, range = 19-58) with an average of 11.94 years of school education (SD = 1.29, range 8-13). Most participants were employed (59%). The remaining participants were either selfemployed (12%), unemployed (12%), university student (10%) or either in high-school or on jobtraining (7%). Six participants (12%) identified themselves as part of an ethnic, religious, political, sexual, or any other minority. All participants provided written informed consent and were reimbursed with 50€ for their participation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Tasks and procedure</head><p>The study design comprised four experimental tasks, namely (1) the word reading task, (2) the encoding task, (3) the recall task, and (4) the prospection task. All stimuli were presented against the black background of a 19-inch LCD monitor (resolution: 1920 x 1200, refresh rate: 60Hz, viewing distance: 80 cm) using Presentation software (Neurobehavioral Systems, San Francisco, CA).</p><p>In the first phase of the experiment, the word reading task was used to assess a baseline measure of LPP responses to reading emotional words. This allowed us to examine whether the words presented as cues in the subsequent recall and prospection tasks elicited potentiated LPP responses before they were paired with the emotion-evoking stimuli. For the word reading task, participants were first presented with 16 neutral 'habituation words' that were irrelevant for subsequent tasks (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>, Panel A). This aimed at allowing participants to habituate to the laboratory and task environment. Following the 'habituation block', participants were presented with blocks of neutral, positive, and negative 'task-relevant' cue words in a semi-randomized order (i.e., these words were used to prompt mental imagery in the following recall and prospection tasks). The cue words were selected to be comparable in length and complexity across valence conditions and to relate only to one specific stimulus of the encoding task (see Supplement S1 for a full list of words). All words were presented for 1,000 milliseconds (ms), followed by a black screen with a fixation cross for 3,000 ms. Participants were asked to read each word while their continuous electroencephalogram and electrodermal activity were recorded.</p><p>For the encoding task (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>, Panel B), participants were instructed to view 16 positive, 16 negative, and 16 neutral pictures that were selected from The International Affective Picture System <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Bradley &amp; Lang, 2007)</ref>. The selection of stimuli was made based on the normative IAPS ratings and participant ratings in a pilot version (N=12) of this study. Identification numbers, mean normative ratings, and picture-to-condition assignment can be found in Supplement S2.</p><p>Stimuli were presented in three blocks that differed by valence of the presented pictures (i.e., positive vs. negative vs. neutral). The order of blocks was semi-randomized across participants with randomized order of stimuli within each block. Each stimulus was presented for 4,000 ms followed by three unipolar visual analogue scales on which participants rated the pleasantness, unpleasantness, and arousal of each stimulus on a 9-point Likert-scale from 1 ("not at all") to 9 ("very strong"). Intertrial intervals had a length of 500-1,500 ms.</p><p>The recall and the prospection tasks (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>, Panel C) followed a 20-minute 'consolidation break', during which participants were offered refreshments to relax and completed a questionnaire battery of a different study. Both the recall and the prospection task followed the same experimental structure as the encoding task, despite differing in instructions given to the participants. For the recall task, participants were instructed that they would now be presented with a series of 'cue words', each relating to one of the previously presented stimuli (see Supplement S2 for stimulus-cue word pairings) and that they should recall each picture as vividly as possible when the respective cue word was presented. For the prospection task, participants were instructed that they would be presented with the same cue words again, but that they should now imagine themselves experiencing the respective situation as vividly as possible right after leaving the lab. In both tasks, cue words were presented in blocks sorted by their valence. The order of blocks was semi-randomized across participants with randomized order of cue words within each block. Each cue word was presented for 1,000 ms followed by a black screen for 3,000 ms. Intertrial intervals varied randomly between 500 and 1,500 ms. After each trial, participants were asked to rate the pleasantness, unpleasantness, arousal, and vividness of their respective mental representation.</p><p>Additional ratings were done after each block asking participants to rate how much effort they exerted to imagine the stimuli and how well they succeeded in recalling or prospecting the stimuli.</p><p>The prospection task included an additional block-wise rating of approach motivation. All ratings were done on the same 9-point Likert-scale.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Electroencephalographic recording and processing</head><p>Electroencephalographical (EEG) activity was measured with 60 active Ag/AgCl scalp electrodes (Easycap, Herrsching, Germany) based on the standard 10-10 international electrode montage with additional external electrodes placed at the left (IO1) and right (IO2) infraorbital site.</p><p>Recording reference was set to FCz with FPz as ground electrode. All impedances were kept &lt;25 kΩ.</p><p>Continuous EEG signals were digitized at a sampling rate of 1,000 Hz with a 64-channel actiCHamp Plus amplifier (Brain Products GmbH, Gilching, Germany) and recorded with a band-pass filter from DC to 250 Hz.</p><p>Raw data were preprocessed using the <ref type="bibr">EEGLAB and ERPLAB toolboxes (vers. 2023.1)</ref> implemented in <ref type="bibr">MATLAB (vers. 2023a)</ref>. Continuous EEG signals were digitally filtered with low and high cutoffs of 0.1 and 30 Hz, respectively (24dB/oct roll-off), and a notch filter of 50 Hz. Eye movement artifacts and eye blinks were removed manually based on an independent component analysis. Components including eye movement or eye blink artifacts were identified by visual inspection of the component activation, scalp distribution, and their comparison to IO1 and IO2 signals. Before segmentation, electrodes were re-referenced using the averaged left and right mastoids, which is in line with previous LPP studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Cuthbert et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Kausche et al., 2022)</ref>.</p><p>Segmentation was done by computing stimulus-locked ERPs between -200 ms and 4,000 ms after stimulus presentation. The epochs were baseline corrected (i.e., -200 ms to stimulus presentation).</p><p>Artifacts were identified automatically, and contaminated epochs were excluded from further analysis based on following criteria: a) absolute voltage range exceeding 200 µV or b) voltage steps exceeding 75 µV between consecutive data points or c) maximum voltage difference of less than 0.5 µV within 100 ms intervals. Based on these criteria, 1.2%, 6.5%, 4.8% and 6.4% of trials in the baseline, encoding, recall and prospections task, respectively, were identified as artifacts and removed from the data. In the recall task, two participants had less than 50% artifact free trials and were therefore excluded from the analysis of the recall task. The exclusion criterion for participants was set to &lt; 50% artifact free trials in any task or condition <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Moran et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Paul et al., 2016)</ref>.</p><p>ERPs were averaged separately for each condition. The LPP was quantified as the mean amplitude between 400 ms and 4,000 ms post-stimulus at a centro-parietal cluster of electrodes comprising Cz, CPz, CP1, CP2, and Pz <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Hajcak et al., 2009)</ref>. To account for potential differences that have been reported between early and late components of the LPP (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Weinberg &amp; Hajcak, 2010)</ref>, the LPP was scored in four successive time windows following stimulus onset ranging from 0.4 to 1 s, 1-2 s, 2-3 s, and 3-4 s.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Acquisition and processing of skin conductance responses</head><p>During each trial, participants' electrodermal activity was measured using two Ag/AgCl electrodes with 12mm sensor diameter placed at the distal and proximal hypothenar eminence of the non-dominant hand. Electrodes were applied at least 5 minutes prior to measurement onset. A low constant-voltage of 0.5 V was passed through the electrodes. The data was digitized at a sampling rate of 1000 Hz using AUX channels of the actiCHamp Plus amplifier. Offline, data were down-sampled to 10Hz. Continuous decomposition analysis was performed using the "optimize" function implemented in <ref type="bibr">Ledalab (Benedek et al., 2010)</ref> running in Matlab (Mathworks®, Natick, Massachusetts, USA). Phasic SCR responses were automatically scored in a response window of 0.9 s to 3.5 s after stimulus onset . The threshold for SCR was a minimum amplitude of 0.01μS.</p><p>Undetectable responses were scored as zeros and included into the analysis. Participants with less than 25% SCRs per task were excluded from subsequent SCR analyses.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>The aim of this study was to develop a standardized experimental mental time travel paradigm and to investigate anticipatory affect responses to mental imagery during mental time travel through positive and negative 'autobiographical' experiences. In the recall and prospection tasks, there was evidence that mental imagery of emotionally salient experiences is associated with anticipatory responses as reflected in potentiated early LPP responses and behavioral ratings of pleasantness, unpleasantness, arousal, and approach motivation.</p><p>The present findings of potentiated LPP responses to positive and negative mental imagery substantiate the evidence showing that activating mental representations of rewarding and threatening outcomes elicits neural anticipatory responses akin to those observed during actual perception, prompting comparable motivational and affective reactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Jackson et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">MacNamara, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Speed et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Suess &amp; Abdel Rahman, 2015)</ref>. Increased LPP amplitudes may reflect the neural processes underlying affect anticipation that is relevant to motivate future behavior and could explain how mental imagery shapes our current and future behavior. Notably, despite similar magnitudes in affect ratings across tasks, there was a remarkable decline in the early LPP amplitudes from the 'encoding task' (negative: M = 6.37, SE = 1.18; neutral: M = 1.45, SE = 0.89; positive: M = 3.16, SE = 0.82), to the recall task (negative: M = 0.59, SE = 0.67; neutral: M = -0.76, SE = 0.60; positive: M = -0.13, SE = 0.67) and the prospection task (negative: M = 0.47, SE = 0.70; neutral: M = -0.49, SE = 0.70; positive: M = 1.07, SE = 0.736 ). This is in line with a previous study showing significantly lower LPP amplitudes during negative mental imagery than during perception of stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Suess &amp; Abdel Rahman, 2015)</ref>. Despite the significant differentiation between neutral and emotionally salient stimuli during prospection, reactivation of emotional experiences by mental imagery might be less potent than the perception of actual stimuli in eliciting electrocortical responses.</p><p>More specifically, the potentiation between emotionally salient and neutral mental imagery in LPP responses was only significant in the early (i.e., 400 ms -1,000 ms), but not in the late LPP components (i.e. 1,000 ms -4,000 ms). While the early LPP is typically referred to as reflecting automatic or rapid attentional processing of emotional and motivational significance of stimuli, late components are usually referred to as reflecting sustained and elaborative processing of stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Hajcak &amp; Olvet, 2008)</ref>, which has been found to be modulated by higher-order cognitive processes such as cognitive appraisal <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Kim et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Speed et al., 2020)</ref>. Previous studies assessing LPP responses to emotionally salient mental imagery found sustained LPP responses beyond the early components of up to 3,000 to 20,000 ms. However, in these studies, cues prompting participants to imagine the stimuli either remained on screen across the entire trial <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Speed et al., 2020)</ref>, were presented for a relatively long duration (i.e., 10,000 ms), allowed participants to elaborate the stimuli more precisely <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(MacNamara, 2018)</ref> or asked participants to imagine only certain specific aspects or details of a stimulus <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Thiruchselvam et al., 2012)</ref> rather than imagining more complex daily-life experiences as depicted in the stimuli of the current study. Consequently, sustained late LPPs during mental imagery in previous studies could indeed reflect higher-order elaborative processing of mental representations, whereas the design of the present study (i.e. short presentation of cues) prevented participants from engaging in detailed elaborative processes. Furthermore, it suggests that envisioning a future positive outcome can result in rapid neural activation indicative of rather automatic activity, which is independent of strategic top-down control. Thus, potentiated early LPPs in the current study are likely to indicate automatic anticipatory reward or threat processing rather than a detailed elaboration of mental representations.</p><p>During the recall task, LPP amplitudes were specifically potentiated during recall of negative but not positive stimuli. Conversely, LPP amplitudes were potentiated during prospection of positive, but not negative experiences. Although speculative at this stage, this may suggest an evolutionary and adaptive learning pattern of a recall bias for negative stimuli that protects the individual from potential threat as well as a positive prospection bias of advanced processing of positive anticipation that drive motivation to seek positive experiences <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Gilbert &amp; Wilson, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Wilson &amp; Gilbert, 2003)</ref>.</p><p>On the neural level, this may be related to an interaction of an optimism bias in expectations and a reward-related bias in attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Kress &amp; Aue, 2017)</ref>. Nevertheless, albeit descriptive effects in the expected direction (i.e., potentiated LPP responses to positive and negative recall and prospection), this pattern of task and valence specific LPP potentiation was unexpected and requires further investigation in future studies. If this bias proves to be robust, it could be utilized to explore differences between non-clinical and clinical populations, which would enhance our understanding of the mechanisms that underlie alterations in prospection and motivation across clinical populations. Given that healthy individuals show a positive bias in anticipating positive affect <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Pilin, 2021)</ref>, one could speculate that this adaptive bias is attenuated in clinical populations, which could explain the alterations in positive mental imagery and anticipatory pleasure in these individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Frost &amp; Strauss, 2016)</ref>.</p><p>The finding that participants rated the recall and prospection of emotionally salient stimuli as less vivid and less successful compared with neutral stimuli was unexpected. This contradicts previous studies suggesting enhanced mental imagery of emotionally salient stimuli (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Kensinger &amp; Corkin, 2003)</ref>. One explanation could be the fact that the positive and negative stimuli used in this study presented significantly more complex and potentially less familiar images than the neutral stimuli (e.g., a shark attack or a Ferris wheel vs. a stapler). Therefore, it cannot be ruled out that the participants' vividness ratings were confounded by the detailedness of their mental representations. Thus, the current pattern of vividness and success ratings could indicate that the subjects perceived themselves as less successful in imagining all the details of positive and negative stimuli.</p><p>Together with the pattern of findings in the behavioral ratings, the LPP responses during the recall and the prospection task suggest that recalling negative and potentially threatening events and prospecting positive events elicits anticipatory responses on both the neural and the behavioral level. These are likely to translate into attenuated versus enhanced behavioral approach motivation.</p><p>However, the current study did not find potentiated SCRs during recall or prospection, which contradicts the findings of the few previous studies reporting elevated SCRs to mental imagery of emotionally salient stimuli. These prior studies found significant potentiation of the SCR in response to mental imagery, yet with large latencies using scoring windows of seven seconds <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Agren, 2023)</ref> to up to 30 seconds <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Lang et al., 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Weerts &amp; Lang, 1978)</ref>. By contrast, the current study used the empirically informed scoring window of 0.9 s to 3.5 s for the SCR to the perception of visual stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Sjouwerman &amp; Lonsdorf, 2019)</ref>. Our finding of potentiated SCRs to negative and positive stimuli during the encoding task thus indicates a successful manipulation of the SCR. Together with prior research, this might however also suggest a delayed SCR to mental imagery when compared to immediate sensory input. Consequently, we cannot exclude that the relatively short trial length of four seconds in the current study has obscured a potentially delayed SCR potentiation during the recall and prospection tasks.</p><p>Several limitations of the current study must be acknowledged. First, due to the lack of available studies investigating LPP during mental time travel, the sample size calculation for the current study was based on a study assessing LPP amplitudes to positive, negative, and neutral pictures. However, consistent with the findings of a previous study <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Suess &amp; Abdel Rahman, 2015)</ref>, LPP amplitudes and effects between valence conditions were significantly lower in mental imagery tasks compared to the encoding task. Consequently, it cannot be ruled out that the current study was underpowered and may have yielded false negative findings. Therefore, future studies using more sensitive analytical approaches with increased statistical power, such as multivariate pattern analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Carrasco et al., 2024)</ref>, or recruiting larger sample sizes based on the effect sizes found in the current study, are needed to further investigate LPP responses during mental time travel.</p><p>To conclude, we successfully developed a mental time travel paradigm that allows to examine the neural processes underlying mental imagery and affect anticipation with a high degree of standardization and between-subject comparability. Our findings indicate that both recall, and prospection of emotionally salient experiences are associated with potentiated electrocortical activity in the LPP and behavioral affect and motivation ratings. These are likely to represent anticipatory responses that drive affect, motivation, and goal-directed behavior. Future studies could build on these findings to investigate aberrancies in mental time travel deficits and affect anticipation in psychopathology.
