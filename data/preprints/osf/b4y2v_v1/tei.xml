<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The evolution of deeply forked tails in highly aerial birds has been suggested to be driven by sexual and viability selection. Using over 20 years of data on the Alpine swift, we investigated the sexspecific predictors and fitness consequences of deeply forked tails, as well as the role of genetics in shaping the evolutionary trajectory of this trait. In the Alpine swift, fork length shows moderate sexual dimorphism, being 7% longer in males than in females. Longer forks were associated with increased reproductive success in males and larger eggs in females, suggesting that this trait may be mutually selected and signal aspects of individual condition in both sexes. In addition, fork length was heritable and strongly genetically correlated between the sexes, with effectively the same genetic architecture expressed in both sexes. However, genetic constraints between the sexes are unlikely to explain the changes in fork length observed over the course of the study, as fork length increased more in females than in males. Further studies will be required to understand why male fork length has not became further elaborated, despite positive directional selection on this heritable trait.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>Sexual dimorphism is widespread in the animal kingdom, encapsulating differences between the sexes in behaviour, physiology or morphology, and ranging from subtle to extreme while favouring one sex or the other <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Fairbairn et al., 2007)</ref>. Sexual dimorphism is expected to arise when the strength and shape of selection on the sexes differs <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Shine, 1989)</ref>, reflecting adaptive differences in the optimal value of the trait for each sex <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Fairbairn et al., 2007)</ref>. For instance, both sexes of the barn swallow Hirundo rustica have elongated tail streamers resulting in deeply forked tails. Deeply forked tails are expected to impact maneuverability and agility, both of which play a crucial role in foraging and predator escape in highly aerial species. The tail streamers of the barn swallow appear to be elaborated past the natural selection optimum in males <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Møller et al., 1998)</ref> thereby increasing drag and incurring aerodynamic costs <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Evans &amp; Thomas, 1992)</ref>, and are considered a classical example of sexual selection. Males with more deeply forked tails have higher levels of circulating testosterone and are preferred as mates by females, but also suffer increased mortality <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Møller et al., 1998)</ref>. Despite controversy around the relative roles of natural vs. sexual selection in driving tail length and shape, especially in swallows (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Evans et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr">Aparicio &amp; Moller, 2012)</ref>, deeply forked tails may arise in both sexes as a product of both natural and sexual selection.</p><p>Because traits expressed in both sexes typically have their origin in shared genetic architecture <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Roff, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Poissant et al., 2010)</ref>, genetic constraints in the form of intra-locus sexual conflict could impede the evolution of sex-specific phenotypic optima <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bonduriansky &amp; Chenoweth, 2009)</ref>. Intra-locus sexual conflicts may be commonplace-especially so in cases of weak or subtle sexual dimorphism where the conflict could be ongoing-and can be assessed by estimating the cross-sex genetic correlation (rMF; <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Lande, 1980)</ref> and sex-specific selection of a shared trait. While an rMF approaching one (positive or negative) suggests the presence of shared genetic architecture between the sexes, and thus constraints on sex-specific evolution, a null correlation suggests little shared genetic architecture and thus that both sexes may evolve to their own sex-specific optimums unhindered <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Poissant et al., 2010)</ref>. Intra-locus sexual conflict is expected in cases were a positive rMF approaching one is coupled with sexually antagonistic selection or were a negative rMF approaching one is coupled with sexually concordant selection <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Kruuk et al., 2008)</ref>. Intra-locus sexual conflict has chiefly been reported in labbased population, namely studies on Drosophila melanogaster (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Rice &amp; Chippindale, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Long &amp; Rice, 2007)</ref>, though it has also been identified in wild populations (e.g., collared flycatcher Ficedula albicollis, <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Merilä et al., 1997</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Merilä et al., , 1998</ref>; mountain goats Oreamnos americanus, <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Mainguy et al., 2009)</ref>. Such genetic constraints have been put forth as one of the explanations for monomorphism, wherein secondary sexual traits are expressed in the non-signaling sex as a result of strong genetic correlations between the sexes. In these cases, one sex would be expected to benefit from the overelaboration of the trait, while the other sex would only bear the costs. Indeed, this argument has been used by some to explain the evolution of tail streamers in female barn swallows <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Cuervo et al., 1996)</ref>, wherein tail streamers that are longer than the aerodynamic optimum are sexually selected in males and may be over expressed in females solely due to the genetic constraint. In line with this expectation, experimentally elongated tail steamers in female barn swallows resulted in decreased reproductive success in the year following the manipulation, suggesting long-term parental investment or flight efficacy costs <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Cuervo et al., 2003)</ref>.</p><p>As an alternative to the genetic correlation hypothesis, monomorphic traits could evolve as a result of mutual selection <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Kokko &amp; Johnstone, 2002)</ref>, wherein the trait would be sexually selected in both sexes. Under mutual mate choice, deeply forked tails could act as a signal of individual condition in both sexes, with individuals of higher condition able to carry the costs of more deeply forked tails.</p><p>Mutual selection is predicted to occur most often in monogamous species with bi-parental care, though its prevalence remains uncertain <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Kokko &amp; Johnstone, 2002)</ref>. Crested auklets Aethia cristatella of both sexes prefer mates with longer feather crests <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Jones &amp; Hunter, 1999)</ref>, and longer tail streamers were associated with higher reproductive success in both sexes of an East Mediterranean population of barn swallows H. r. transitive <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Vortman et al., 2011)</ref>.</p><p>The aim of this study was to investigate the sex-specific fitness consequences and genetic architecture of deeply forked tails in a wild population of Alpine Swifts Tachymarptis melba, a highly aerial insectivore. We first quantified the sex-specific reproductive and viability selection acting on fork length. As longer wings have been identified as a compensatory trait for deeply forked tails, minimizing their aerodynamic costs <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Fitzpatrick, 2008)</ref>, and since the allometric scaling of fork length to wing length is sex-specific <ref type="bibr">(Dumas et al., in prep)</ref>, we also considered direct and indirect selection acting on fork length and wing length in both sexes. We expected deeply forked tails to provide benefits for males but not females in terms of reproductive success, and costs for both sexes in terms of survival, consistent with general theory on traits subject to sexual selection. Indeed, though the bulk of works on this topic are on swallows, recent works have provided some support for the role of sexual selection in driving the evolutionary of more deeply forked tails in male swifts (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Hasegawa &amp; Arai, 2020</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">, Jukema et al., 2023)</ref>. Because sexual conflict at the genetic level requires the traits in question to be heritable, we then quantified the additive genetic variance and heritability of fork length in both sexes. We additionally assessed the importance of genetic constraints in the evolution of sexual dimorphism in fork length by estimating the cross-sex genetic correlation, with the expectation that such a correlation would be strongly positive. Finally, we evaluated the micro evolutionary trajectory of fork length over the course of the study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>METARIAL &amp; METHODS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study site &amp; species</head><p>The Alpine swift is a long-lived (median lifespan: approx. 7 years; maximum: 26 years; <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bize et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Moullec et al. 2023</ref>) and colonially nesting bird. They live a highly aerial lifestyle, capable of remaining in constant flight for over six months at a time <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Liechti et al., 2013)</ref>, and landing only during the breeding period. Colonies of a few to a hundred pairs will nest on cliffs or in the roof spaces of tall buildings when nesting in urban settings. Alpine swifts nest from May to August, with both parents incubating their 1-4 eggs for approximately 18 days <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Bize et al., 2004)</ref>. Chicks take approximately 50 to 70 days from hatching to fledging, during which time both parents will brood and feed them <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Bize et al., 2004)</ref>. As such, males and females are expected to have similar parental allocation into reproduction, with the exception of egg laying for which females alone pay the energetic costs (e.g., females show a more pronounced decrease in body mass over the season than males, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Dumas et al., 2024)</ref>.</p><p>Since 1999 and 2000 respectively, two urban-nesting colonies have been intensively monitored in the Swiss cities of Biel (60-100 breeding pairs) and Solothurn (40-55 breeding pairs). In both colonies, birds are individually identified by permanently ringing them as nestlings or at their first capture at adulthood if not already ringed as nestlings. Parents are caught by hand at the nest, their identity is recorded, and their yearly reproductive success is determined (clutch size, brood size at hatching and fledgling). As no extra-pair paternity (EPP) has been recorded in this population (C. M. Meier &amp; P. Bize, personal comm.), these behavioural observations are sufficient for pair-bond identification and to construct a detailed social pedigree. Individuals are measured to the nearest millimetre using a ruler (e.g., wing, tail and fork lengths) or tenth of a millimetre using a caliper (e.g., sternum length) and sexed (DNA taken from blood or feathers; <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Griffiths et al., 1998)</ref>. Fork length is measured as the distance between the tip of the inner tail feather and the tip of the outer tail feathers. The inner tail feather is calculated as the difference between the outer tail feather and the fork length. These feather traits are measured once per individual per year captured.</p><p>Although Alpine swifts have historically been considered to be monomorphic like most swifts, subtle sexual dimorphisms are present (e.g., females are 1% heavier than males, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Dumas et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr"></ref> males have 7% more deeply forked tails than females, <ref type="bibr">Dumas et al., in prep)</ref>. Fork length in swifts range from monomorphic in the Plain Swift Apus unicolor <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Garcia-Del-Rey et al., 2008)</ref>, to minorly dimorphic in the Comon swift Apus apus (males have more deeply forked tails than females, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Jukema et al., 2023)</ref>, to strongly dimorphic in the Black swift Cypseloides niger borealis (males have more deeply forked tails than females, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Gunn et al., 2018)</ref>, with sexual dimorphism in other feather and morphometric traits documented in some species (e.g., male Pallid swifts Apus pallidus have longer wings than females, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Boano et al., 2015)</ref>. Despite the presence of these slight sexual dimorphism, Alpine swifts appear monomorphic to human observers, and hence field measurements are taken blind to the sex of the individuals.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical analyses</head><p>All statistical analyses were conducted in R version 4.3.1 "Beagle Scouts" (R Core Team, 2023), using the R packages lmerTest <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Kuznetsova et al., 2017)</ref> and MCMCglmm <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Hadfield, 2010)</ref>. For all models, we examined fork length, the fork to outer tail feather lengths ratio and the fork to inner tail feather lengths ratio so as to account for differences in the fork length and depth relative to the outer and inner tail feathers. Indeed, deeply forked tails can be produced by one of two mechanisms: lengthening of outer tail feathers and/or shortening of inner tail feathers. Results from all three approaches were qualitatively similar and hence only the fork length models are included in the manuscript, while the relative fork depth models are reported in the supplemental. Absolute and relative fork depths were mean-centered and scaled to a variance of 1, pooled across the sexes. Year, as a continuous variable, was also mean-centered and scaled to a variance of 1. When included in the analyses, quadratic effects were calculated using orthogonal polynomials. All models were first tested with the inclusion of all biologically relevant interaction terms and quadratic effects; non-statistically significant interaction terms <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Engqvist, 2005)</ref> and non-statistically significant quadratic effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Faraway, 2014)</ref> were dropped from the final models and are reported only in the supplemental. Data presented in these analyses spans 1999-2021.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Selection analyses</head><p>In a first part, we investigated the fitness consequences of relatively deeply forked tails in both sexes. We ran a series of linear and generalized linear mixed effects models to investigate the fitness consequences of fork length on measures of reproductive success and overwinter survival. We considered direct and indirect selection acting on fork length and wing length, as longer wings may compensate for the aerodynamic costs of deeply forked tails. We further considered both female and male traits as selection may operate differently on each sex. Overwinter survival was estimated for breeding individuals only based on yearly records of capture, as the probability of recapturing birds in this population is nearly one <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bize et al., 2006)</ref>.</p><p>Reproductive success traits considered were clutch size (Poisson distribution, log-link), brood size at hatching (Poisson distribution, log-link) and at fledgling (Poisson distribution, log-link), and the weighted proportion of surviving fledglings (binomial distribution, logit-link). The weighted proportion of surviving fledglings was modelled as brood size at fledging over clutch size. Surviving fledglings are defined as those that successfully leave the colony.</p><p>Since nonbreeding individuals have typically not yet reached sexual maturity, we also considered the relation between fork length and breeding status (binomial distribution, logit-link). In addition, we considered the relation between fork length and egg laying date (Gaussian distribution), as laying date is strongly related to fitness in the Alpine swift <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(de Villemereuil et al., 2020)</ref> despite not being a fitness component per se. Laying date was modeled as day of the year and mean-centered and scaled to a variance of 1. Finally, we considered the relation between fork length and egg volume (Gaussian distribution), as previous studies have identified a trade-off between egg size and deeply forked tails in swifts and swallows (females with more deeply forked tails produced smaller eggs; <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Hasegawa &amp; Arai, 2017</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">, 2018)</ref>. Egg volume was calculated as egg length x width 2 x π/6 following <ref type="bibr">Bize et al., 2002.</ref> For each reproductive parameter, we fit a model with reproductive success as a function of female and male fork length, female and male wing length, and the colony. Female and male identity as well as the year were included as random effects to account for repeated measurements on the individual and yearly levels, respectively. These models were conducted at the pair level, as reproductive success require concerted effort from both parents with both parents providing care to their offspring at all stages. Models were fitted with both linear and quadratic effects for male and female fork length and wing length, but the quadratic term was dropped from the final model as these were not statistically significant (Table <ref type="table">S2</ref>).</p><p>The breeding status (binomial distribution, logit-link) and overwinter survival models (binomial distribution, logit-link) were run at the individual level, and thus included sex as a fixed effect. We fit breeding status as a function of sex, fork length (linear and quadratic terms), and colony, with individual identity and year as random effects to account for repeated measures. We also included the two-way interaction term between sex and fork length (linear and quadratic), but these were removed the final model as they were not statistically significant (Table <ref type="table">S2</ref>). We fit overwinter survival as a function of sex, fork length, and colony, with individual identity and year as random effects to account for repeated measures. We also included the two-way interaction term between sex and fork length but it was removed from the final model as it was not statistically significant (Table <ref type="table">S2</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Quantitative genetic analyses</head><p>In a second part, we investigated the predictors of fork length in female and male Alpine swifts.</p><p>We assessed the sexual dimorphism in fork length, with the expectation that males would have more deeply forked tails than females, as shown in previous work on the Alpine swift <ref type="bibr">(Dumas et al., in prep)</ref>, and since previous studies have suggested a sexually selected role of deeply forked tails in males <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Hasegawa &amp; Arai, 2020)</ref>. As Alpine swifts have been subject to rapid morphometric changes over the past two decades (e.g., wing and tail lengths have increased in both sexes, Masoero et al., in prep), we considered sex-specific changes in fork length over the course of the study. As such, we fitted a generalized linear mixed effects model with fork length as a function of sex, the year (linear and quadratic), and colony as fixed effects, with an interaction term between sex and year to investigate whether fork length changed in the same ways over the course of the study in both sexes. We further considered the effect of male and female age (linear and quadratic) on fork length, as previous studies on the Alpine swift have revealed sex specific ageing trajectories of morphometric traits <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Moullec et al., 2023)</ref>. Since the quantitative genetic analyses results with and without the age effects were qualitatively similar, and including individual age decreases the available sample size by approximately 30%, we report age effects only in the supplemental (Table <ref type="table">S6</ref>, Table <ref type="table">S7</ref>).</p><p>We estimated quantitative genetic parameters of fork length by including pedigree data (an 'animal model', <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Kruuk et al., 2008)</ref>. Animal models allow users to decompose total variance between environmental and genetic sources, and hence make inferences about the evolutionary potential of a trait <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Kruuk et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Wilson et al., 2009)</ref>. We estimated the following sex-specific variance components: additive genetic variance (individual identity linked to the pedigree), permanent environment variance (individual identity), yearly variance (year of observation) and residual variance. In addition, we estimated the cross-sex genetic and yearly covariances and correlations, to assess the presence of genetic constraints on the evolutionary potential of fork length. Variance parameters were estimated as the median, mean and posterior mode following <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Pick et al. (2023)</ref> and reported with their 95% highest posterior density intervals (HPDI) (the mean and posterior mode are reported in the supplemental only, Table <ref type="table">S9</ref>). Variance ratio estimates were calculated as the proportion of total phenotypic variation explained by the given variance parameter, i.e., heritability conditioned on the fixed effects was estimated as the sex-specific additive genetic variance divided by the (conditional) total phenotypic variance. The pruned social pedigree used in this study was 5 generations deep and included data on 1396 individuals, with 590 maternities and 571 paternities (Table <ref type="table">S5</ref>). The social pedigree statistics were determined using the R package pedantics <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Morrissey, 2018)</ref>.</p><p>For the residuals and the permanent environment effect, for which cross-sex correlations cannot be estimated, we used standard priors with V = diag(2), nu = 1.002. For the additive genetic and year effects, we used expanded priors, adapted for models estimating cross-sex correlations (i.e., V = diag(2) * 0.02, nu = 3, alpha.mu = rep(0, 2), and alpha.V = diag(2) * 1000). The model had a burn-in period of 50000 iterations and was sampled every 2000 iterations for a total effective sample size of 1500. Plot traces were visually assessed, and absolute autocorrelation values were verified to be &lt;0.1.</p><p>We verified chain convergence for each parameter using the Heidelberger and Welch's convergence diagnostic (heidel.diag function) as recommended by <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Hadfield (2010)</ref>; all converged well.</p><p>In addition, we refitted the previous animal model without the inclusion of year as a fixed or random effect in order to assess whether or not there have been genetic changes in this trait over the course of the study. To do so, we estimated the predicted breeding values (PBV) of female and male fork length using best linear unbiased predictors (BLUPs) based on individual phenotypic information as well as that of relatives <ref type="bibr">(Henderson, 1950)</ref>. We then fit the female-trait and male-trait breeding values as a function of the year of birth of each individual (linear and quadratic) to investigate changes in PBV over the course of the study. The quadratic effect of the year of birth was non-statistically significant and hence was dropped from the model. These linear regressions were fit on the PBVs of each posterior sample from the animal model, allowing us to estimate the posterior distribution (median) of the slope <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Hadfield et al., 2010)</ref>. We further simulated random breeding values following the pedigree for each posterior sample in order to estimate the changes in PBV over time due to genetic drift, and to assess whether the change in female-trait and male-trait PBVs over time were stronger than those expected under drift alone <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Hadfield et al., 2010)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ethical note</head><p>Adult swifts were caught at the nest between 8h00 and 20h00 (usually between 9h00 and 18h00) to avoid disturbing the adults during periods of intense social activity (dawn and dusk) <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Meier et al., 2018)</ref>. We minimized the number of captures and disturbances during severe weather events to avoid extra stress to the birds. To further limit stress to the birds, swifts were placed in cloth bags and handled quickly, typically 5-15 minutes depending on data collection. All individuals were released at the colony site. All handlers were trained by PB or senior members of the field team. All work was conducted in accordance with international standards on animal welfare and in compliance with Swiss local and national regulations (ringing permit 2235 &amp; project 72 delivered to Pierre Bize by the Swiss Federal Office for the Environment).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Selection analyses</head><p>On average, there were more breeding females than breeding males, and breeders had more deeply forked tails than nonbreeders with a non-linear increase in breeding probability in relation to fork length (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). Female but not male fork and wing length had a positive effect on egg volume (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). There were no detectable effects of either female or male fork length or wing length on egg laying date (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). Likewise, there was no detectable selection on female or male fork length or wing length in relation to clutch size (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). However, males with more deeply forked tails had larger brood sizes at hatching and fledgling as well as a greater weighted proportion of surviving fledglings than males with less deeply forked tails (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). In addition, males with shorter wings had larger brood sizes at hatching than males with longer wings (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). There were no statistically significant effects of female fork length or wing length in relation to brood size at hatching nor fledgling, or to the weighted proportion of surviving fledglings (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). There were no statistically significant differences in overwinter survival in relation to sex, fork length or wing length (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). There were statistically significant colony differences for all measures of reproductive success as well as breeding status, laying date and overwinter survival, with more breeding individuals, earlier laying dates, larger eggs, larger clutch and brood sizes (hatching, fledgling, weighted proportion of surviving fledglings) as well as greater overwinter survival in Solothurn as compared to Biel (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). These results were qualitatively similar when looking at the relative fork depth (ratio of fork length to inner or outer tail feather length) rather than absolute fork length (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">S3</ref>), and when removing wing length from the models (Table <ref type="table">S4</ref>).</p><p>Table <ref type="table">1</ref>. Linear (LMM) and generalized (GLMM) linear mixed-effects models assessing the association between fork length and breeding status (binomial distribution), laying date (gaussian distribution), clutch size (Poisson distribution), brood size at hatching (Poisson distribution) and at fledgling (Poisson distribution), the weighted proportion of surviving fledglings (binomial distribution) and overwinter survival (binomial distribution). The T-Value is reported for the laying date model, while the Z-Value is reported for all other models. Statistically significant estimates (P &lt; 0.05) were bolded.

Average fork length was of 24.1 mm in males and 22.5 mm in females (raw data, Table <ref type="table">S1</ref>). The inner tail feather length was comparable between sexes, with longer outer tail feathers in males than in females (Table <ref type="table">S1</ref>). On average, birds of both sexes in Biel had more deeply forked tails than birds in Solothurn (Table <ref type="table">2</ref>). Fork length has increased over time, with a more pronounced increase in females, such that fork length has become more similar between the sexes over the course of the study (Table <ref type="table">2</ref>).</p><p>We report relatively high additive genetic variance in both sexes, of 0.56 [0.45; 0.67] (median [95% HPDI]) in females and 0.44 [0.32; 0.55] in males (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">3</ref>). Heritability was likewise high in both sexes, explaining of 60% [51; 68] of the variance in females and 52% [41; 62] of the variance in males.</p><p>Despite appearing slightly higher in females than in males, additive genetic variance and heritability were comparable between the sexes: a model for which additive genetic variance was constrained to the same value for both sexes performing no better than one where they were permitted to vary (Table <ref type="table">S8</ref>). The permanent environment explained 14% [7; 22] of the variance in females and 16% [7; 25] of the variance in males (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">3</ref>). The year effect explained only a small proportion of variance in fork length accounting for 4% [2; 7] in females and 6% [3; 10] in males. There were strongly positive cross-sex genetic (0.89 [0.76; 0.99]) and year (0.95 [0.86; 0.99]) correlations in fork length (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">3</ref>, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). The cross-sex genetic correlation was effectively 1, as a model estimating the correlation did not perform better than one where it was fixed to 1 (Table <ref type="table">S8</ref>). The median, mean and mode of the posterior distribution were all comparable and are reported in the supplemental (Table <ref type="table">S9</ref>). A model with a single estimate pooled across the sexes for each of the variance components and ratios likewise performed similarly (Table <ref type="table">S9</ref>). Results for the relative fork length (inner or outer tail feather) where likewise qualitatively similar (Table <ref type="table">S10</ref> &amp; S11).</p><p>The predicted breeding values of female-trait fork length and male-trait fork length may both have increased slightly over the course of the study (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>), though the estimates were near zero and with credible intervals crossing zero (median of the slopes (with lower and upper 95% HPDI): femaletrait 0.02 (-0.02; 0.06); male-trait 0.01 (-0.03; 0.04); Table <ref type="table">S12</ref>). The estimated rate of increase in femaletrait and male-trait fork length over the study period was greater than expected under genetic drift alone in 70.1% and 61.7% of cases, respectively (Pr[slopee &gt; sloped] Table <ref type="table">S12</ref>). As PBVs could be estimated both for individuals born before the start of data collection and individuals with no collected data based on ancestry information, we also ran the analyses with all PBVs, the results of which were qualitatively similar and presented in the supplemental (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref>, Table <ref type="table">S12</ref>, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">S13</ref>).</p><p>Table <ref type="table">2</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p>In this study, we investigated the predictors and fitness consequences of tail fork length in both sexes of a Swiss population of Alpine swifts. Fork length showed moderate sexually dimorphism, with males displaying tails with longer forks than females. In line with the expectation that forked tails are a sexually selected signal in males, males with longer forks had greater reproductive success than those with shorter forks. Females with longer forks produced larger eggs, suggesting a greater allocation into reproduction than females with shorter forks, and that fork length may be a positively selected trait in both sexes. Contrary to our expectations, longer forks did not appear to incur survival costs for either sex. Finally, the length of the fork was heritable and positively genetically correlated between the sexes, with effectively the same genetic architecture in males and females.</p><p>On average, males had forks which were 7% longer than those of females (raw data). This sexual dimorphism was driven primarily by sex differences in the outer tail feather length, as the inner tail feather was effectively of the same lengths in both sexes (Table <ref type="table">S1</ref>). It was therefore unsurprising for analyses on the absolute and the relative fork depth (fork / outer tail feather length and fork / inner tail feather length) to be qualitatively similar. Although most swifts have historically been considered to be monomorphic, sexual dimorphism in fork length has also been reported in the Common swifts (3-7%; We report that males with longer forks had greater reproductive success than those with less deeply forked tails. Males with longer forks had larger brood sizes at hatching and fledgling as well as a greater weighted proportion of surviving fledglings than males with shorter forks. This is consistent with the expectation for fork length to be a sexually selected trait in male swifts <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Hasegawa &amp; Arai, 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Males with more deeply forked tails likewise are reported to have greater reproductive success than those with less deeply forked tails in the barn swallow <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Møller et al., 1998)</ref>, with the length of the fork possibly acting as a reliable signal of offspring longevity <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Møller, 1994)</ref>. Thought little is known about the behaviours of swifts outside of the breeding period, they likely engage in aerial courtship displays, and possibly also aerial threat displays, as has been suggested in Common swifts <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Lack, 1956)</ref> and Chimney swifts Chaetura pelagica <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Fischer, 1958)</ref>. Indeed, birds of many species use their tails in agonistic and/or sexual displays <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Fitzpatrick, 1998)</ref>. Males with more deeply forked tails may also have greater foraging success than those with less deeply forked tails, potentially specializing on different prey, and hence may be better able to provision their offspring. Male pallid swifts have been found to consume larger prey than females <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Fernandez et al., 2023)</ref>, suggesting that dietary niche segregation between the sexes could also be possible in the Alpine swift.</p><p>Females with longer forks produced larger eggs-and hence, had greater energetic investment into reproduction-than females with shorter forks. This is contrary to what previous studied have identified in other species, with a possible trade off between deeply forked tails and egg size in swifts and swallows <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Hasegawa &amp; Arai, 2017</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">, 2018)</ref>. Females with longer forks may, like their male counterparts, have greater foraging success than those with shorter forks, perhaps as a result of the prey species available in these regions. However, although numerous studies have shown that larger eggs give rise to larger hatchlings that grow faster and are more likely to survive up to fledging <ref type="bibr">(Bize et al., 2002)</ref>, there was no detectable effect of female fork length on more direct measures of reproductive success (clutch size, brood size at hatching and fledgling, weighted proportion of surviving fledglings). This suggests that the previous benefit of larger eggs do not translate into higher reproductive success, and thus that longer forks may still be costly to bear for females. Contrary to our expectations, we report no selection on fork length in relation to overwinter survival in either sex, suggesting that deeply forked tails did not hamper overwinter survival for either sex. However, overwinter survival may not accurately reflect the costs of deeply forked tails. Rather, fork length may incur costs during incubation or chick provisioning in terms of increased effort (e.g., increased energetic expenditure or foraging time) which will need to be investigated in future studies.</p><p>Thought our study was unable to detect costs of fork length in either sex, deeply forked tails in barn swallows have been associated with increased oxidative damage <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Vitousek et al., 2016)</ref>, which can impair survival <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bize et al., 2014)</ref>. As these costs should be especially apparent during and following migration, which represents a period of high exertion and risk, individuals with less deeply forked tails (and hence less drag) should have a clear advantage. One possible future avenue of research in the Alpine swift could then be to investigate the link between fork length and arrival to the breeding grounds, with the expectation that those with longer forks would arrive later-should there be a cost associated with deeply forked tails.</p><p>Furthermore, fork length presented comparable and moderate additive genetic variance and heritability in both sexes. This suggests that fork length has the potential to evolve in response to selection in both sexes. We found a strong positive cross-sex genetic correlation suggesting that females and males would be positively correlated in any evolutionary response. Per the genetic correlation hypothesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Lande, 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bonduriansky &amp; Chenoweth, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Poissant et al., 2010)</ref>, this strong cross-sex genetic correlation could explain the presence of forked tails in females despite direct advantages of more deeply forked tails only being found for males. However, male fork length has remained relatively static over the course of the study, with female fork length increasing to more closely resemble that of males. Given clear reproductive benefits for males with longer forks, the strong genetic correlation across sexes, and no detected costs in either sex, we would have expected fork length to increase in a similar way in both sexes. We found small (but not statistically significant) changes at the genetic level in both sexes. As such, it is unlikely for the observed changes in fork length in this population to have occurred as a result of selection and genetic constraints on fork length. Rather, this more rapid change in female than male fork length could be due to as of yet unidentified environmental causes. Though preliminary GPS data suggests that Alpine swifts forage mostly within a 15km radius surrounding the colony during the breeding period <ref type="bibr">(Brighten et al., pers. com.)</ref>, it remains unknown whether males and females forage in the same areas or on the same time, or if they specialize on the same insect prey.</p><p>Indeed, male Pallid swifts appear to prey on larger arthropods than females <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Fernandez et al., 2023)</ref>. It would be interesting to look at links between fork size and foraging strategies using GPS loggers and diet using metabarcoding. Female foraging habits may have changed over the last decades, perhaps as a result of climate change, accelerating the changes in their fork length.</p><p>To conclude, fork length is a moderately sexual dimorphic trait likely to be under sexual selection in the Alpine swift. Longer forks conferred reproductive benefits to females and males in terms of reproductive allocation and success, respectively, suggesting that fork length has the potential to signal aspects of individual condition in both sexes. The sexes effectively shared the same genetic architecture for fork length, with relatively high heritability and a cross-sex genetic correlation approximating one, indicating that males and females should share the same evolutionary trajectory. In line with this, we identified a possible increase in breeding values in both sexes over the course of the study. Though it remains unclear why female fork length increased while male fork length remained relatively static over the course of the study and finer scale studies on male and female foraging behaviour would be needed. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.

Fork depth has also been shown to increase with age in barn swallows, as the combined result of both outer tail feather lengthening and inner tail feather shortening with age(Adamkova et al., 2022). Older birds are generally considered to be more experience than younger birds and may be more skilled when it comes to migration (e.g., older Whooping cranes Grus americana deviate less from a straight-line migration path then younger birds, Muller et al., 2013) and breeding behaviours (e.g., older mute swans Cygnus olor lay earlier and have larger clutches than younger birds,</figDesc><table /><note><p><p><p><p><p><p><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">McCleery et al., 2008)</ref></p>. In our population, fork length has been shown to increase in early life in both sexes</p><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Moullec et al., 2023;</ref>  </p>present study, Table</p>S6</p>), while remaining relatively stable from approximately 5 years of age onwards. As such, it is unlikely that our results are simply a reflection of age effects on reproduction.</p></note></figure>
