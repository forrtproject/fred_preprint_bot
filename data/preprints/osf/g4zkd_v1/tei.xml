<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The coronavirus disease 2019 , declared a worldwide pandemic on 11 th March 2020, has had profound and far-reaching impacts on global health, economies, and daily life <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Barai &amp; Dhar, 2021)</ref>. As the virus spread rapidly across countries and continents, governments and health organizations faced unprecedented challenges in mitigating its effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Abodunrin et al., 2020)</ref>. Widescale promotion of compliance with  preventive behaviours, such as vaccination, social distancing, face maskwearing, hand hygiene, and QR code check-in (a contact tracing system) <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Burns, 2023)</ref>, were the linchpin strategies of health agencies worldwide to bring COVID-19 infection rates under control. Compliance with these preventive behaviours together with the urgency to contain the virus and prevent further transmission, underscored the need for rapid yet effective public health massaging <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Filip et al., 2022)</ref>.</p><p>Public health campaigns can play an important role in promoting healthrelated practices and influencing individuals' behaviours, employing various strategies to disseminate information, shape attitudes, and encourage the adoption of compliance behaviours <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Kelly &amp; Barker, 2016)</ref>. Diffusion of information has often included methods such as mass media campaigns <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Robinson et al., 2014)</ref>, targeted social media messages <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Pagoto et al., 2016)</ref>, community outreach programs <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Luque et al., 2014)</ref>, and policy measures <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Sallis et al., 1998)</ref>. Despite the multiple outlets to broadcast information to mitigate further COVID-19 infection and bolster COVID-19 preventive behaviours, determining the effectiveness of public health campaigns and assessing the strategies used within the messaging, is paramount. This often involves evaluating the ability of the message to engage the public through using clear and understandable communication, persuasive and motivational messaging techniques, and leveraging psychological principles of behaviour change <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Bonell et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, the development of public health messages had to keep pace with the rapidly increasing rate of infection <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Nan et al., 2022)</ref>. As a result, many messages were created and disseminated based on existing knowledge, often without the benefit of extensive empirical evidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Gesser-Edelsburg, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Simonovic &amp; Taber, 2022)</ref>. While these messages were aimed to inform and protect the public, the urgency of the pandemic situation often precluded the use of theoretically-based and empirically-informed approaches. This is important as campaigns rooted in established theories of behaviour change have been shown to be more effective in promoting health behaviours compared to atheoretical campaigns <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Davies, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Glanz &amp; Bishop, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Hagger &amp; Weed, 2019)</ref>.</p><p>Theories of behaviour provide a framework to inform intervention development, offering insights into the mechanisms and processes that foster behaviour change <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Hagger et al., 2020)</ref>. Commonly used are models of social cognition, a prototypical model being the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB).</p><p>The TPB posits behavioural intentions as the proximal predictor of behaviour, with intentions shaped by attitudes (the degree to which an individual believes the behaviour will result in positive or negative outcomes or affective states), subjective norms (the perceptions of significant others approval or disapproval of undertaking the behaviour), and perceived behavioural control (the perceived ability to perform or overcome barriers to performing a behaviour) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Ajzen, 1991)</ref>. The parsimony of model constructs and meta-analytic support for explaining behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Cooke et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Hagger &amp; Hamilton, 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">McEachan et al., 2011)</ref> has allowed the TPB to be used as a framework for the systematic assessment of interventions, examining alignment of message content and embedded behavioural strategies with the TPB psychological determinants. Previous research has successfully used the TPB to design, implement, and evaluate of health interventions <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Armitage &amp; Talibudeen, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Darker et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Gratton et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Hamilton et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Hardeman et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Kothe et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Mullan &amp; Wong, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Steinmetz et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">White et al., 2019)</ref>.</p><p>As the world transitions from the pandemic to endemic phase of COVID-19 infection management, ongoing compliance with COVID-19 preventive behaviours remain a priority, and, alongside this, continued messaging to encourage compliance (Australian Government Department of <ref type="bibr">Health and Aged Care, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr">World Health Organization, 2023)</ref>. Thus, an assessment of public health messages used during the pandemic is a valuable step in determining their potential effectiveness and identifying the strategies used within. This process will signpost the use or lack of theory and empirically supported behaviour change strategies applied to messages in this context, thereby informing future efforts. Specifically, the aim of the current study was to analyse the presence and prevalence of belief-based constructs and strategies known to foster behaviour change embedded within Australian Government communications regarding QR code check-in and compliance behaviour during the COVID-19 pandemic using the TPB as a guiding framework. Knowledge gained from this study and the systematic protocol to assess message content can be applied in future message development aimed at improving compliance behaviours in general.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Materials and methods</head><p>This study employed an environmental scan methodology <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Charlton et al., 2019)</ref> to systematically review online material within Australian Government communications regarding QR code check-in compliance behaviour during the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, QR codes were implemented as an efficient method of contact tracing in Australia, enabling timely notifications of individuals who had come into close contact with someone who tested positive for COVID-19 <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Nakamoto et al., 2020)</ref>. This study aimed to analyse the presence and prevalence of belief-based constructs and strategies known to foster behaviour change <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Hagger et al., 2020)</ref> for this novel COVID-19 preventive behaviour. Two primary search strings (S1 and S2)</p><p>were developed: S1 focused on the terms "Covid-19" AND "QR code" while S2 targeted the specific application "Covidsafe". Searches were conducted using the Google search (www.google.com.au) and social media platforms (Facebook, YouTube, X/Twitter). In addition, searches were performed on the websites of the Australian Federal Government, Queensland State Government, and Victoria State Government. This approach considered the differences in extreme experiences of COVID-19 in Australia, as the state of Victoria had experienced seven lockdowns, and the state capital, Melbourne, had the longest cumulative time in lockdown in the world <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Stobart &amp; Duckett, 2022)</ref>, while the state of Queensland experienced relatively few lockdowns and thus less disruptions to everyday life <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Edwards et al., 2022)</ref>. The search strategy navigated to page sites, and relevant PDF and video resources were downloaded between October and December 2023. Only messages published in English and delivered by an Australian government or healthcare authority website and addressing QR code check-in compliance behaviour were considered. All collected files were securely stored on Google Drive, with restricted access through password protection available to the research team.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Data analysis</head><p>Two members of the research team independently assessed all the identified material against the inclusion criteria. The first author then extracted data into a comprehensive data abstraction table developed by the research team. The extracted information and study characteristics incorporated the file name, corresponding to the files saved on Google Drive, the meaning unit, condensed meaning unit, and belief code. Data were analysed using narrative synthesis methods to extract and distil discrete messages and categorise messages into their targeted psychological constructs <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Hagger et al. 2020</ref>) and adopted behaviour change techniques (BCTs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Michie et al., 2013)</ref>. Data organisation, coding, and analysis were informed by a content analysis approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bengtsson, 2016)</ref> and SPSS v. 29 software was used to calculate frequencies of the belief-based constructs and BCTs. Any conflicts in the identification of belief codes were resolved through team consensus. Due to the use of publicly accessible information, human research ethics approval was not required for this study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Results</head><p>Six belief codes of knowledge, attitude, norm, risk perception, selfefficacy, and intention/motivation were identified in 17 communication messages delivered by the Australian Federal Government, Victoria State Government, and Queensland State Government. Within these 17 messages, five BCTs were identified: comparison of outcomes (credible source) (CR), shaping knowledge (instructions on how to perform a behaviour) (INS), natural consequences (information about health consequences) (HLT), comparison of behaviour (information about others' approval) (APP), and goal setting (GS). The prevalence of these belief codes and identified BCTs across the communication messages is illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>, highlighting the majority and minority of occurrences. Table <ref type="table">1</ref> presents the belief codes and BCTs identified through the environmental scan.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Belief codes</head><p>In identifying the embedded belief codes in the communications, 13 out of the 17 communication messages adopted attitude statements, specifically highlighting the advantages of QR code check-ins. These advantages were emphasised through statements such as: "a successful way to help stop or slow the spread of COVID-19" (1), "hospitalization numbers and community transmission decreasing, restrictions can be safely eased" (3), "ensure the focus continues to be on helping businesses follow the rules" (4), and "contact tracing information can only be used or disclosed if there is a public health purpose or other scenarios" (6).</p><p>Twelve out of 17 exhibited self-efficacy statements, for example: outlining the steps for scanning QR codes for the general public (1) and providing instructions for businesses to register, print posters, and display them at venues (5). Also, messages guided visitors on downloading the app (8,11), scanning with their phone camera (10,11), linking their digital vaccination certificate to the Check-In app (12), and performing group checkins (13). Further instructions included using the Check-in app to add the COVID-19 digital certificate (14), utilising a Medicare account to add the certificate to the Check-In Qld app (16), and using an Individual Healthcare Identifier to add the COVID-19 certificate to the Check-In Qld app <ref type="bibr">(17)</ref>.</p><p>Communications also highlighted that the QR code check-in app is new, free, easy to use, and secure, bolstering self-efficacy by assuring users of their potential capability to use it <ref type="bibr">(8,</ref><ref type="bibr">9,</ref><ref type="bibr">11,</ref><ref type="bibr">15)</ref>.</p><p>Eleven out of the 17 communication messages delivered knowledge provision related to various aspects of QR code usage. These included: defining QR codes (1); providing instructions for businesses and customers, Kiosk Check-in, and workplaces associated with QR code check-in (2); information about the removal of venue restrictions and re-openings (3); details on fines, enforcement notices, verbal warnings, improvement notices, and court prosecutions (4); and specifying that contact tracing information can only be used or disclosed for public health purposes or other specific scenarios (6), with Victoria Police not having access to this information (6).</p><p>Additionally, the messages covered the use of a downloaded picture from a smartphone (7), privacy information (10), group check-in procedures (13), how to use a Medicare account to add a COVID-19 digital certificate to the Check-In Qld app (16), and how to use an Individual Healthcare Identifier to add a COVID-19 certificate to the Check-In Qld app (17).</p><p>Three out of 17 messages contained normative statements, highlighting the approval and desire from others to comply with QR code check-in practices, such as: The Victorian Government has today launched a new campaign calling on all Victorians to check-in everywhere, every time (2); To help keep Queensland COVID safe, we all need to check in at businesses electronically (8), and To help keep Queensland COVID safe, businesses must check in customers electronically (9). Similarly, three out of 17 communications conveyed intention/motivation statements, illustrating the degree of effort, planning, preparedness, or willingness to comply with QR code check-in behaviour. Statements like: With the pressure on the health system easing and third dose vaccination coverage climbing, the Minister will consider if it is appropriate to remove the recommendation that Victorians work from home (3); Victorian government will ask residents isolating at home to participate in a trial of a check-in app ( <ref type="formula">7</ref>); and The more businesses that sign up, the better it will be for all of us (11). Only one out of 17 messages exhibited risk perception statements: A new $1,652 on-the-spot fine, where there are repeated breaches, a further $9,913 fine can be issued and businesses may be prosecuted in court for continued, blatant, or wilful noncompliance with the rules (4), emphasizing the penalty associated with noncompliance with QR code check-ins. Overall, these three belief-based statements constituted a minority of the messages.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">BCTs</head><p>In identifying the BCTs used within the communications, the majority of communications, 12 out of 17, used INS technique, such as: instructions on how to scan QR codes (1); information on registering the business, printing a poster, visitors scan the QR code and download the app, data collection and storage (5); instructions on how to scan the QR code with your phone camera Victorians to check-in everywhere, every time (2); we all need to check in at businesses electronically (8); businesses must check in customers electronically (9). Two out of 17 messages employed GS technique, such as: the Minister will consider if it is appropriate to remove the recommendation that Victorians work from home (3); the more businesses sign up, the better it will be for all of us (11).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Discussion</head><p>Evidence has supported the use of QR code check-ins as a means of contact tracing to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Biala et al., 2022)</ref>; however, the success of this strategy relies on people's compliance. Although COVID-19 is no longer considered a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (World Health Organization, 2023), reflecting on messaging for the compliance of COVID-19 preventive behaviours is important for future pandemic preparedness, especially given the emergence of novel coronavirus variants or outbreaks <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Otto et al., 2021)</ref>. This research aimed to address this need by analysing the presence and prevalence of belief-based constructs and BCTs used within Australian Government communications regarding QR code check-in during COVID-19 using the TPB as a guiding framework.</p><p>Campaigns from Australian health authorities aimed to increase compliance with QR code check-in behaviour were predominately delivered through message campaigns, such as media releases, posters, mass media, social media, and digital channels (Department of Health and Aged Care, 2022). However, research evaluating the efficacy of these messaging campaigns in promoting compliance is limited. Research on the efficacy of health messages used in other domains have highlighted the importance of ensuring messages are theoretically-based and empirically-informed <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Hamilton et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Hrisos et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Irvine et al., 2023)</ref>. Previous research has identified a range of TPB-based beliefs that predict individuals' intentions and self-reported behaviour to scan the QR code when entering physical venues <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Mac, Phipps, Parkinson, Cassimatis, et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr">Mac, Phipps, Parkinson, &amp; Hamilton, 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Nakamoto et al., 2020)</ref>. These identified beliefs provide potential targets for messages in the aim of improving compliance rates. However, it is unknown to what extent message content for QR code check-in behaviour captured these beliefs or used known strategies to change behaviour.</p><p>Our analysis identified that knowledge, attitude, and self-efficacy beliefs are prominently embedded in the majority of QR code check-in related messages delivered by Australian government authorities during the Covid-19 pandemic. These messages frequently emphasised the importance of understanding the QR code check-in process (knowledge), the positive outcomes associated with compliance (attitude), and the ease with which individuals could complete the check-in process (self-efficacy). This alignment with empirical research underscores the effectiveness of these beliefs in promoting health behaviours. Studies have shown that knowledge about health behaviours enhances motivation <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(de Melo Ghisi et al., 2014)</ref>, positive attitudes towards these behaviours increases the likelihood of compliance <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Mac, Phipps, Parkinson, Cassimatis, et al., 2024)</ref>, and higher self-efficacy boosts individuals' confidence in their ability to perform the behaviours <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Sheeran et al., 2016)</ref>. However, a recent meta-analysis indicates varied outcomes, suggesting that while these beliefs are potentially important, their impact may differ across contexts and populations <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(McAnally &amp; Hagger, 2023)</ref>. Thus, the value of these three beliefs lies in their combined ability to foster an informed, motivated, and confident public, essential for the successful implementation of public health interventions, such as QR code check-ins.</p><p>In contrast, norms, risk perception, and intention/motivation only accounted for a minority presence in the Australian government communications. Norms represent the societal and peer expectations that influence individuals' compliance with QR code check-ins, while risk perception pertains to the potential fines and legal consequences of noncompliance. Intention/motivation reflects the individual's personal commitment and willingness to adhere to the check-in requirements. These findings from the environmental scan, however, do not capitalise on empirical research which shows that norms, such as perceived peer approval and social conformity, significantly enhance compliance with public health measures <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bokemper et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Young &amp; Goldstein, 2021)</ref>. Similarly, research on risk perception demonstrates that while it may influence people's decisions, effects are often maximised when the perceived threat is immediate and severe <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Alegria et al., 2021)</ref>, as was the case in COVID-19, albeit this was mostly relevant to the elderly and those immunocompromised. Thus, caution is needed in designing message content that taps into risk perceptions. Intention is also a significant predictor of compliance behaviour in empirical studies, including QR code check-in <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Mac, Phipps, Parkinson, Cassimatis, et al., 2024)</ref>.</p><p>In precis, although norms, risk perceptions, and intention/motivation This is important given knowledge and attitudes often do not translate well into behavioural action <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Heeren et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Juvan &amp; Dolnicar, 2014)</ref>. Also, although the majority focus on providing concrete behavioural instruction in the messaging is to be commended, given self-efficacy beliefs have consistently been shown to impact behaviour change <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Sheeran et al., 2016)</ref>, previous research on QR code check-in has shown a lack of support for perceived behavioural control (akin to self-efficacy) <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Mac, Phipps, Parkinson, Cassimatis, et al., 2024)</ref>. The perceived ease or simplicity of the behaviour might explain this finding, as might the global measurement of this construct.</p><p>For example, when examining specific barriers to QR code-in behaviour, time has been identified <ref type="bibr">(Mac, Phipps, Parkinson, &amp; Hamilton, 2024)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Implications for health marketing</head><p>This environmental scan identified six beliefs and five BCTs embedded in QR code check-in communications delivered by the Australian government during the COVID-19 pandemic, offering an opportunity to examine how this information is conveyed and practically implemented. Building on previous research, government messages related to health compliance behaviours and health marketing can develop content based on psychological beliefs and BCTs known to influence individuals' compliance intentions and behaviour.</p><p>These strategies include leveraging attitudes through interventions such as information provision, communication persuasion, or cognitive dissonance <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Hamilton et al., 2020)</ref>. Furthermore, in alignment with knowledge provision, policymakers could consider augmenting educational approaches with reinforced policy measures. These measures could include increased enforcement of non-compliance penalties and implementation of punitive sanctions <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Murphy, 2008)</ref>. Other strategies, such as preparing for setbacks (like overcoming the barrier of time to check in) and issuing self-talk statements (like "you can do it") <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Warner &amp; French, 2020)</ref> alongside instructional messages, might further enhance perceived control over behavioural performance, so building self-efficacy.</p><p>Moreover, given the influential role of normative influences and habits for compliance behaviours in general <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Fornara et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Martín et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Nord et al., 2020)</ref>, and in particular for QR code-in <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Mac, Phipps, Parkinson, Cassimatis, et al., 2024)</ref>, there exists an opportunity to improve current messaging, drawing on strategies to enhance these factors.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Strengths and limitations</head><p>To the author's knowledge, this is the first study to conduct an environmental scan of Australian Government and health organization announcements, providing a comprehensive examination of the communication landscape regarding QR code check-in compliance behaviour during the Covid-19 pandemic. A rigorous and systematic approach was employed to identify the beliefs embedded in these messages, thereby pinpointing knowledge gaps and opportunities for improvement in the content and delivery of the information provided. The search terms were meticulously structured to capture all relevant beliefs pertinent to the study's aim.</p><p>However, the study findings should be considered in light of certain limitations. Despite the thorough document search conducted, some relevant materials may have been overlooked as COVID-19 receded, although this is considered unlikely given the nature of these documents. Additionally, the focus on QR code check-in compliance behaviour is particularly relevant to the Australian context. Future research would benefit from extending the environmental scan to other compliance behaviours in broader contexts. This research represents a preliminary step in identifying the beliefs communicated by the Australian Government during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>Future research could also focus on enhancing the content and delivery of information, drawing on evidence-based risk factors and empirically established psychological factors. These factors underpin behavioural prompts for compliance and avoidance of financial penalties associated with noncompliance behaviours.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusion</head><p>Given research indicating the importance of QR code check-in compliance behaviour during the COVID-19 pandemic, it is essential that effective messages, which are theoretically-based and empirically-informed, are developed. Current findings highlight the use of potentially effective strategies in the messages to change behaviour; for example, drawing on attitudinal and self-efficacy beliefs. Yet, results also identified gaps, such as a lack of strategies to highlight normative influences and build habits, that can inform future messaging and pandemic preparedness, Improving the quality of information regarding compliance behaviours is vital for effective public health campaigns and may significantly contribute to fostering compliance behaviours in broader contexts. <ref type="bibr">Mediarelease1_vic.gov_17.06.2021</ref> QR code data is a key source of intelligence for Victoria's contact tracers. The more Victorians that check in, the faster the team can address outbreaks and ease any restrictions in the future. Businesses, including supermarkets, take-away shops and other retail settings are now required to use the Government's QR code through the Service Victoria app and to ensure their customers check-in upon arrival, even if they visit the venue for only a few minutes.</p><p>For customers who are unable to check-in themselves, the Government has also developed a Kiosk Check-in service that allows businesses to check-in their customers via the Service Vic App. More than 4,800 locations across Victoria have the Kiosk Check-in service up and running with some venues setting up multiple devices. Over 94,000 check-ins have been made using the service in the past week. Workplaces are also expected to ensure their employees check in via the Service Victoria app when working on site.</p><p>The Victorian Government has today launched a new campaign calling on all Victorians to check-in everywhere, every time. The campaign will be live across TV, radio, print, social, digital and out-of-home media, and will be translated and tailored to culturally and linguistically diverse communities.</p><p>A Under the orders, QR code check-in requirements will no longer be in place at retail venues, schools (including childcare and early childhood) and for employees at many workplaces. QR code check-in and vaccination check requirements will remain in all 'vaccinated economy' settings such as hospitality and entertainment venues. Currently, key industries including meat processing observe mandatory surveillance testing requirements. These mandates will be become recommendedonly, reflecting declining community transmission. Requirements for hospital worker 'bubbles' will also be removed, but health services may still implement them at their discretion. Small and proportionate adjustments will also occur to border settings for international arrivals, who will no longer be required to obtain an international arrivals permit through Service Victoria. The 14-day hotel quarantine period for international visitors and aircrew who aren't fully vaccinated or medically exempt will reduce to 7 days.</p><p>With the pressure on the health system easing and third dose vaccination coverage climbing, the Minister will consider if it is appropriate to remove the recommendation that Victorians work from home. Authorised officers will be out and about throughout May and June, targeting compliance with record-keeping and QR code requirements. Businesses not doing the right thing will be issued with the $1,652 fine, along with an Improvement Notice which triggers a follow up visit.</p><p>Where there are repeated breaches, a further $9,913 fine can be issued and businesses may be prosecuted in court for continued, blatant or wilful noncompliance with the rules. This approach will ensure the focus continues to be on helping businesses to follow the rules, while still enforcing fines on blatant breaches. The new fine bolsters the mandatory switch to the free Victorian Government QR Code Service through the Service Victoria app from 28 May 2021. Visitors simply need to scan the QR code using their smartphone camera. For those with up-to-date smartphone software, a pop-up will appear asking for a first name and contact number.</p><p>For other users, they will be directed to download the Service Victoria mobile App from the Apple or Google Play app stores to complete the check-in. A unique six letter code entered on a web site will be on each QR code poster, for visitors to check-in also.</p><p>All data collected through the Victorian Government QR code is securely stored, protecting customers from on selling of contact details. Data will be deleted after 28 days unless it is specifically requested by the Department of Health and Human Services for contact tracing purposes.</p><p>For businesses or venues that are currently using an existing market-led QR code solution, the Government is working with the sector to develop an Application Programming Interface to allow these systems to link directly into DHHS Contact Tracing systems when check-in data is required.</p><p>To You give consent for your information to be used or disclosed In the performing functions or exercising powers under the new pandemic framework To address an immediate risk to someone's life, safety, health or wellbeing To undertake enforcement action against you for providing false or misleading information under the Act or against a person who has used or disclosed the information where not permitted to do so.</p><p>Can Victoria Police access the information I have provided?</p><p>No, Victoria Police will not have access to this information unless they are required to take any of the actions outlined above. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>(</head><label></label><figDesc>10) and how to use a Medicare account to add a COVID-19 digital certificate to the Check In Qld app (16).

Across the 17 government communications analysed, a consistent pattern emerged despite varied expression methods in that these communications typically combined two to three beliefs to positively frame their messages. The most common combination included knowledge provision, attitudes -advantages associated with QR code check-in compliance, and selfefficacy -beliefs about personal confidence in, control over, or difficulty in performing the behaviour. Norms and intentions/motivation were sometimes included to reinforce perceptions of approval, disapproval, cultural and moral norms, and the effort or willingness required for QR code check-in compliance. Notably, only one communication addressed risk perception, which introduced negativity into the message. Overall, the messages delivered by the Australian government predominantly emphasised the positive aspects of compliance behaviour. This supports the literature where beliefs in positive outcomes for QR code check-in exhibited stronger associations with intention and behaviour than reported negative outcomes (Mac, Phipps, Parkinson, &amp; Hamilton, 2024). Also, research has shown that messages framed to emphasise the positive consequences of performing the desired behaviour tend to be more effective than messages that highlight the negatives (O'Keefe &amp; Jensen, 2008). Analysis of the 17 communication messages also showed the use of various BCTs to promote QR code check-in compliance during the COVID-19 pandemic. A predominant use of the "Shaping Knowledge" (INS) technique, identified in 12 out of the 17 messages, underscores the emphasis on educating the public about the practical steps required for compliance, such as how to scan QR codes and manage digital certificates. This suggests a recognition of the need to build procedural knowledge to bolster self-efficacy and facilitate behaviour change. The "Natural Consequences" (HLT) technique, utilised in nine messages, highlights the need of conveying the health benefits of compliance, reinforcing the role of QR code check-ins in effective contact tracing and public safety. The use of "Comparison of Outcomes" (CR) in seven messages, often involving credible sources and enforcement measures, illustrates an effort to enhance the perceived legitimacy and urgency of the mandated behaviours. Interestingly, the relatively lower frequency of "Comparison of Behaviour" (APP) and "Goal Setting" (GS) techniques, observed in only three and two messages respectively, indicates that while social norms and goal-oriented strategies are present, they are less emphasised. This distribution of BCTs suggests a focused approach on informative, attitudinal, and instructional messaging, with potential areas for enhancement including the increased use of normative influences and goal-setting strategies to foster a more comprehensive behaviour change communication framework.</figDesc></figure>
