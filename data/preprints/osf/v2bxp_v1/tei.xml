<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>What effect does nominating a female top candidate have on voters? While numerous studies investigate the effect of ordinary candidates, it is unclear how the nomination of female leading candidates affects women. We provide the first study that addresses this question by exploiting the nomination of Annalena Baerbock by the German Green Party as the party's top candidate in the 2021 election. This nomination provides a unique opportunity to identify the causal effect of a female leading candidate as it was entirely unclear whether Annalena Baerbock or the Greens' male co-leader, Robert Habeck, would be nominated until the day of the announcement. By leveraging a survey among nearly 70,000 citizens in the field during the nomination, we shed light on how her nomination affected voters. The results show a positive impact of Baerbock's nomination for the Greens, but among women as well as men. We complement this analysis with a survey experiment among 9,000 respondents in Germany to investigate the underlying causal mechanisms. We find that there is a positive effect of nominating a female top candidate instead of a man and that these effects are driven by a desire to promote gender equality and by a shared social identity of respondents.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Although female participation in politics has increased in recent years, there is still a sizeable gender gap in political participation. Gender parity is far from being reached and equal distribution of political power still has a long way to go <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Eder, Fortin-Rittberger and Kroeber, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Kroeber et al., 2019)</ref>. Women continue to be massively underrepresented.</p><p>Worldwide, only 23 countries are headed by a woman and women make up only 25% of all national parliamentarians, 36% of local government members, and 21% of national ministers. 2 Given the normative goal of gender parity, how does nominating women for the political top jobs impact voters' preferences? In this study, we examine to what extent the nomination of women as parties' top candidates can help to mobilize women in in elections.</p><p>Research on descriptive representation argues that citizens are more likely to vote for a candidate that looks like themselves <ref type="bibr">(Mansbridge, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Pitkin, 1967)</ref>. Empirical research has, however, found mixed results. Whereas several studies have found that female voters are more likely to participate when they are represented by women (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Atkeson, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Fridkin and Kenney, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Wolbrecht and Campbell, 2007)</ref>, other studies have found that female representation does not lead to increased political engagement among women (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Broockman, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Gilardi, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Wolak, 2020)</ref>. Importantly, these studies have focused on female elected officials at the local, state, or legislative levels. What we do not have, however, is a good understanding of the effect of a female top candidate-a female candidate for prime minister, for example-on female mobilization.</p><p>The few existing studies on female leader effects have found mixed results about whether voters evaluate female leaders differently than male leaders. O'Brien (2019), for example, finds that parties with female leaders are perceived by voters as more moderate and <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Boussalis et al. (2021)</ref> show that voters punish displays of anger by female leaders. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bridgewater and Nagel (2020)</ref> find that citizens evaluate female party leaders more positively than male party leaders. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Dassonneville and McAllister (2021)</ref>, however, show 2 Source: https://undocs.org/E/CN.6/2021/3 1 that this positive assessment is limited to experienced politicians who have served in executive offices and that voters are less likely to support parties with female leaders.</p><p>Importantly, there is some heterogeneity across gender in terms of leader evaluation and electoral support. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Banducci and Karp (2000)</ref>, for example, have found a gender identity dynamic in which women assess female leaders more positively and are more likely to vote for them. In a study of party leaders during the 2011 Danish electoral campaign, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Kosaira-Pedersen and Hansen (2015)</ref> similarly find that female leaders are assessed more positively by female voters. And in Australia, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Denemark and Bean (2012)</ref> demonstrate that female voters were mobilized to vote for Julia Gillard, the leader of the Labour Party. The contradictory evidence may be partly due to the lack of causally identified studies given that is very hard to disentangle a female leader effect from other potential confounding factors. Thus, despite the strong gender bias in politics, we have limited and also contradictory evidence on the effect of female party leaders on the mobilization of women.</p><p>We seek to contribute to this important debate by providing the first study that allows for causally identifying the effect of a female party leader running as a top candidate in an election campaign. We first conduct a preregistered unexpected events during survey design analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Muñoz, Falcó-Gimeno and Hernández, 2020)</ref> exploiting the nomination of Annalena Baerbock by the German Green Party as the party's top candidate (i.e. candidate for Chancellor) in the 2021 election. This nomination provides a unique opportunity to identify the causal effect of a female leading candidate nomination as it was entirely unclear whether Annalena Baerbock or the Greens' male co-leader, Robert Habeck, would be nominated until the day of the official announcement. By leveraging a massive survey among nearly 70,000 citizens that was in the field both before and after the day on which Baerbock's nomination was announced, we shed light on how her nomination affected female voters. We then complement this analysis with a survey experiment among 9,000 respondents in Germany to investigate the underlying causal mechanisms.</p><p>We find that the Baerbock nomination had a statistically significant and sizeable positive effect on the probability that women would vote for the Green Party. There is, moreover, also a positive effect for men, albeit somewhat smaller in size, suggesting that there is a general mobilization effect of nominating female top leaders. Since the observational data does not allow us to disentangle whether the nomination resulted in a general mobilization effect or whether it was the nomination of Baerbock as a female top candidate which was decisive, we have run a survey experiment to shed further light on the underlying mechanisms. We find that there is a positive effect of nominating a female top candidate instead of a male candidate and that these effects are driven by a desire to promote gender equality and by a shared social identity of respondents. Our results have important implications for the debate on gender and politics.</p><p>Our findings contribute to the literature in two different ways. First, we advance the literature on the role of gender in politics <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Atkeson, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Broockman, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Fridkin and Kenney, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Gilardi, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Wolak, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Wolbrecht and Campbell, 2007)</ref>. In both the observational and experimental analyses, we demonstrate that women are more likely to vote for a party if it has nominated a female lead candidate. Second, our study also adds to the literature on political leaders (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Aarts, Blais and Schmitt, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bittner, 2011)</ref>.</p><p>More specifically, our study demonstrates that gender is an important characteristic that affects how party leaders are evaluated by voters.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theoretical Expectations</head><p>Recent research has found that voters do indeed consider party leaders in their decision-making, even in parliamentary systems. This has become increasingly so in systems where we have seen a presidentialization or personalization of politics, where party leaders or top candidates matter more in the decisions of voters (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bittner, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Dalton and Wattenbeg, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr">Poguntke and Webb, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Rahat and Scheafer, 2007)</ref>. Instead of considering the party more generally when casting their vote, voters are now focusing more on the leader, their personality traits, and level of competence <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bittner, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Costa Lobo and Curtice, 2015)</ref>. This is especially the case in parliamentary systems with increasingly candidate-centered campaigns, leader debates, and a high level of media coverage. This is in addition to other factors which have presidentialized the executive itself, including the resources allocated to the prime minister and patterns of ministerial recruitment <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Poguntke and</ref><ref type="bibr">Webb, 2015, 2005)</ref>.</p><p>With this increasing focus on leaders in parliamentary systems, we expect that the gender of party leaders also plays a role in voters' evaluations of parties and specifically those of women. We argue that the nomination of a female top candidates increases the likelihood that women will support the party. We suggest that there are several mechanisms at play which could explain why the nomination of female top leaders affects female voters.</p><p>First, we posit that female leaders may be considered to be more moderate than their male counterparts. O'Brien (2019) finds that parties with female leaders are perceived by voters as more moderate even when controlling for the parties' stated policy positions in their election manifestos. Thus, female voters who have a desire to challenge extremism may be more likely to support a party with a female leader.</p><p>Second, voters may associate policy competence with gender. There is evidence that voters have stereotypical views of women's policy competences, e.g. education, healthcare, welfare for children and elders <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Huddy and Terkildsen (1993)</ref>. Therefore, voters who prioritize these policy issues are more likely to increase their propensity to vote for a female-led party. We expect that women on average value these policies more then men and that female voters are therefore more likely to vote for parties with female top candidates.</p><p>Third, voters who consider gender equality as an important issue may be more inclined to vote for female top candidates. Gender equality as a societal goal is evaluated differently by different parts of the population and these groups may vary in how they react to a female-led party. Thus, those who believe the society is more unequal and see gender inequality as an on-going issue will prefer a female top-candidate as a way to ameliorate this concern. We expect that women on average consider gender inequalities as a more important problem then men and that female voters are therefore more likely to vote for parties with female top candidates.</p><p>Finally, social identity may be a key driver that could explain why female voters may prefer female top candidates. Social identity theory posits that individuals derive part of their self-concept from their membership in social groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Huddy, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Sanbonmatsu, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Tajfel et al., 1971)</ref>. Women may prefer female political candidates because they perceive a shared social identity, leading to a sense of solidarity and trust. This preference is driven by the belief that candidates who share their gender are more likely to understand and advocate for their interests and concerns.</p><p>We examine each of these explanations in the survey experiment. But, first we turn to an observational analysis to test the overall expectation that the nomination of a female top candidate increases women's propensity to vote for the party.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data and Empirical Strategy</head><p>To test the effect of nominating a female top candidate, we first conduct a preregistered unexpected events during survey design analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Muñoz, Falcó-Gimeno and Hernández, 2020)</ref> exploiting the Baerbock nomination by the German Green Party as the party's top candidate (or candidate for Chancellor) in the 2021 federal election. This nomination provides a unique opportunity to identify the causal effect of a female leading candidate nomination as it was entirely unclear whether Annalena Baerbock or the Greens' male co-leader, Robert Habeck, would be nominated until the day of the official announcement.</p><p>In the following, we explain the empirical strategy and the data in more detail.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Nomination</head><p>The 2021 electoral campaign to the German Bundestag provides a unique opportunity to identify the causal effect of nominating a top female candidate on the mobilization of women. While it is typically clear for weeks who will become the top candidate of a party in an electoral race, the Green Party took a different approach in 2021. It was essentially an open question up until the day when the announcement was made. The Greens decided that two party leaders at the time, Robert Habeck and Annalena Baerbock, should settle this decision secretly between themselves and announce it on 19 April. Both candidates kept quiet about the nomination question until 19 April and there was importantly (and perhaps unusually) no leak of information. Thus, it was essentially a truly open race between the male and female co-party leaders.</p><p>There were arguments in favor and against both candidates:<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">3</ref> Some claimed that Robert Habeck would be more promising due to his prior experience as environment minister in the state of Schleswig-Holstein or his strong popularity among the general public. Others argued that Annalena Bearbock would be the ideal candidate, as the Green Party, with its long-standing feminist tradition, needed to send a signal by nominating a woman.</p><p>In addition, many believed Annalena Bearbock would be more popular among party activists.  Google Trends data for the search terms "Baerbock" and "Habeck" furthermore demonstrated that public interest for both candidates was fairly similar before 19 April confirming journalists' assessments that it was largely unclear who would become top candidate (see figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). Similarly, a LexisNexis Search for newspaper articles mentioning the names "Baerbock" or "Habeck" together with the key terms "chancellor candidate" shows a very similar picture (see figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>): There is no clear trend before the nomination on 19 April, and if there is any difference, there are slightly more mentions of Habeck instead of Baerbock. However, after the nomination, public interest on Google as well as media coverage of Baerbock skyrocketed showing that the nomination apparently surprised both, voters and journalists alike. Finally, Baerbock and Habeck scored identically in betting odds with a probability of becoming chancellor of 4.76% which again underlines the unexpected nature of the nomination (see table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">B</ref>.1 in the Supplementary Materials (SM)). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Identification Strategy</head><p>To identify the causal effect of the Baerbock nomination on female voters, we rely on an unexpected events during survey design <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Muñoz, Falcó-Gimeno and Hernández, 2020)</ref>.</p><p>As it was entirely unclear which of the two candidates would win up until the 19 April, the nomination of Annalena Baerbock can be considered as an unexpected event (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Minkus, Deutschmann and Delhey, 2019)</ref>. Our identification strategy splits the sample of respondents into treatment and control group based on her nomination on 19 April.</p><p>The control group consists of all respondents who were interviewed before the nomination, while the treatment group is made up of all respondents who were questioned after her nomination was announced. The unexpected events design was pre-registered on 18 January 2022 on AsPredicted<ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">5</ref> prior to obtaining high-frequency data that we purchased from the survey company Civey on 11 May 2022.<ref type="foot" target="#foot_3">6</ref> </p><p>They Civey data was collected from 16 until 23 April 2021 and contains 69,629 observations. Respondents surveyed on 19 April were excluded from the analysis. 7 Figure A.1 in the SM shows the distribution of respondents over time. The outcome variable is the intention to vote for the Green Party in the election to the Bundestag in September 2021 coded as "1" if the respondents indicate they will vote for the Greens and "0" otherwise. We additionally control for a number of sociodemographic variables provided by Civey which include age (measured in age categories), regional purchasing power, regional population density, a dummy for East Germany and the state ("Bundesland") in which the respondent resides. 8</p><p>We note that the Civey data is not necessarily representative of the German population.</p><p>We address this issue in two different ways. First, to identify the causal effect of the Baerbock nomination, it is not necessarily important that the sample is representative, but that the sample is balanced between treatment and control group. Balance checks show that there is a slight difference with regard to the educational background between treatment and control group, but that the dataset is overall already sufficiently balanced and that matching cannot increase balance (see sections F and H in the SM). Second, we additionally estimated the analysis using survey weights based on data from the German Microcensus and the results are essentially the same (see section I in the SM).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Estimation</head><p>To estimate the causal effect of the Baearbock nomination on the intention to vote for the Greens, we estimate the following model:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Y i = δT i + α i + ϵ i</formula><p>where Y i is the intention of respondent i to vote for the Greens at the Bundestag election, 7 A robustness check excluding respondents surveyed on 19 April yielded the same results (see Tables G.1 and G.2 in the SM).</p><p>8 Civey additionally provided data on the educational background of respondents, but this is only available for about 7,500 respondents. We exclude this control from the main analysis, but a robustness check using the limited sample shows that the treatment effect remains stable when we control for educational background (see table G.3 in the SM.)</p><p>T i is the binary treatment indicator which indicates whether respondents have been surveyed after the nomination of Baerbock, α i corresponds to a set of sociodemographic controls and ϵ i is the error term.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> presents the results of the regression analysis. 9 We find that the Baerbock nomination indeed had a statistically significant positive effect on the intention of women to vote for the Greens. Compared to female voters surveyed before the nomination, women questioned after the nomination were on average about 6.4 percentage points more likely to vote for the Green party. Moreover, we find that there is also a statistically significant effect for men which amounts to 6.0 percentage points. The difference between women and men is, however, not statistically significant, suggesting that the nomination of Annalena Bearbock had a general mobilizing effect on voters. It is important, however, to consider if this effect can be explained by any other event that occurred at the same time as the nomination. A look at the top 15 search terms on Google suggests that the answer is no (see table C.1). All other search terms clearly relate to non-political issues that cannot explain the results.</p><p>9 Further robustness checks can be found in the SM. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Survey Experiment</head><p>The above observational study establishes a positive effect of nominating a female top candidate. This finding comes with two key limitations, though. First, we cannot distinguish whether the effect is due to the general leadership decision or whether it is the nomination of a female leader specifically. Second, we cannot evaluate whether the effect is exclusive for green parties, which cater to a more progressive voter base.</p><p>To shed light on these open questions, we supplement the observational study with a preregistered original survey experiment that we fielded among more than 9,000 citizens in Germany.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment Design and Estimation</head><p>The survey experiment follows a factorial design with three factors (6 x 2 x 3). First, respondents are prompted to imagine an upcoming Bundestag election and they are presented with a mixed leadership duo of one of the six current German parliamentary parties (CDU/CSU, FDP, Green party, SPD, The Left, AfD) (first factor ). We relied on images from the Faces Research Lab London Set (FRLLS) database (DeBruine and Jones, 2021) that allows users to alter and repurpose the images for non-commercial use. Among other specifications, the database provides portrait images of smiling individuals and offers data on age, race self-selection and an attractiveness rating by 2500 respondents.</p><p>The depicted duo is constant across parties apart from party cues in terms of logo and color and has been selected by testing multiple images in a pre-test for similar scores across perceived age, attractiveness and race. Both candidates are also introduced with a short bio that we generated using ChatGPT<ref type="foot" target="#foot_4">10</ref> , which is randomized between candidates.</p><p>Second, respondents are informed that all other parties have decided on a top candidate and that it is either an all-male or mixed field (second factor ). Finally, participants are then randomly presented with either a decision for the male or female party leader as top candidate or no leadership decision at all (third factor ). An overview of the flow of the survey experiment can be found in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>. We obtained IRB approval at Humboldt University in Berlin (HU-KSBF-EK 2023 0018).</p><p>We estimate the average treatment effect (ATE) of either receiving any treatment or receiving the male or female top candidate treatment on our outcomes via ordinary least squares (OLS) regression using heteroscedastic robust standard errors. For the analysis of heterogeneous treatment effects, we are interested in the conditional average treatment effect (CATE) given some factor or pre-treatment covariate. The estimation follows the above described strategy with additional interaction terms for the given covariate in question.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment results</head><p>We first present estimation for the main effects, namely effects on respondents' propensity to vote for the nominating party across included parties. Then, we explore heterogeneous effects dependent on the party in question as well as potential mechanisms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Main Results</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref>: Main effects on PTV of the party in question (standardized) across treatment versions (95% CIs)</p><p>We examine the effect of a party nominating a female top-candidate on respondents' propensity to vote (PTV) for the party in question. Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref> plots the effects for both treatment versions on PTV. We see that the female nomination has a significant positive effect on PTV, while we find null effects for the male nomination and across treatment versions. If we examine these results by gender, we find that it is especially women who react positively to the nomination of a woman, while men appear rather unmoved on average (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results by Party</head><p>First, we turn to the effects of nominating a female top candidate on respondents' propensity to vote for the nominating party for both men and women and among women specifically. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">8</ref> depicts the effects of nominating a woman on PTV per party for both men and women. Overall across both women and men, we see that it is mainly the Greens and the FDP which profit from nominating a female top candidate. For all other parties, we find null effects.</p><p>Next, we turn to exploring how the nomination of a female top-candidate impacts women's PTV per party. Turning to Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">9</ref>, we find significant positive effects of a female nomination among women for the CDU/CSU as well as the FDP. Although all other point estimates are clearly positive as well, the effects for the other parties remain insignificant. Thus, while the Greens and the FDP benefit from nominating a women across the entire  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mechanisms</head><p>Turning to potential mechanisms that may explain these findings, we pre-registered the exploration of four potential mechanisms following our explanations above for why the nomination of a female candidate may attract more women to the party. First, we hypothesized that the nomination of a woman might have a moderating effect (O'Brien, 2019), thus increasing a party's electability. We do not find significant effects of nominating a woman on perceived party extremism, as indicated by left-right positioning (see SM section M).</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">10</ref>: Effects of female nomination on PTV along average importance of stereotypically female policy issues among women (95% CIs) Second, we proposed that voters prioritizing stereotypical female policy issues such as healthcare, education and family might prefer a female candidate <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Huddy and Terkildsen, 1993)</ref>. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">10</ref> shows that women who give high priority to these policy issues do indeed react more positively to the female nomination.</p><p>Third, we turned to respondents' assessment of gender equality in Germany. Here, we posited that voters who assess Germany as more unequal in terms of gender inequality and who think that policies addressing gender inequality are insufficient will prefer a female top-candidate. An interaction analysis across both items reveals that female respondents who see German society as more unequal are positively affected by a female nomination, while the interaction with respondents' assessment of current policies addressing gender inequality is more ambiguous (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">11</ref>).  Fourth, building on social identity theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Huddy, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Sanbonmatsu, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Tajfel et al., 1971)</ref>, we hypothesized that women who strongly identify with women as a social group might react positively to a female nomination. Interacting the treatment with an additive index derived from a four-item battery on social identity, we find that women who express a strong social identity as women reward the nomination of a woman (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">12</ref>). Lastly, in an extension of the analysis that has not been pre-registered, we explore whether the female treatment did have any effects on the political efficacy of female respondents.</p><p>We measured internal and external efficacy with two items each. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">13</ref> plots the effect estimates on an additive index of both dimensions. We see that the female nomination did have a positive effect on women's external efficacy, but not on their internal efficacy. This would suggest that women feel more listened to by politicians, due to the nomination of a woman, but they do not feel more empowered personally.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">13</ref>: Effects of female nomination on political efficacy among women (95% CIs)</p><p>In sum, then, we find support for three of the four proposed mechanisms -the importance of stereotypically female policy issues, the perception of gender inequality and identifying with women as a social group -in explaining female support for a female-led party.</p><p>Moreover, an extended analysis shows that the female nomination did also increase women's external political efficacy.</p><p>Bringing together the overall results from the observational and experimental analyses, we find that women are more likely to support a party with a female top-candidate, confirming our expectation. The experiment indicates that among the entire electorate, it is mainly the Greens and Liberals would profit from nominating a woman. Focusing the analysis on women, we find that it is primarily Liberals and Christian Democrats who would win over female voters. In the observational analysis, we do find that there is some effect on men as well in their propensity to vote for the German Greens after Baerbock's nomination. However, in the survey experiment, we find that men are on average not more likely to vote for a party with a female lead candidate. The described effect on men thus seems to be specific to the nomination of Baerbock in 2021 or due to higher precision in the observational estimation. Looking at the effects of the female nomination among men only, we see positive point estimates for the Greens and Liberals, although all estimations remain insignificant (see section L).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>In this paper, we have examined the effect of nominating a female top candidate on voters. Using an unexpected events during survey design based on a massive survey of nearly 70,000 respondents in the field during Baerbock's nomination in April 2021 and complementary survey experiment in the field in November 2023, we were able to causally identify the effect of a female top candidate on voters' propensity to vote for a party. We find that in 2021 the Greens won female, but also male, voters who previously supported other parties. The supplementary survey experiment confirms the overall positive effect of a female top-candidate -across parties. Moreover, an analysis into potential mechanisms shows that it is mainly respondents who see gender equality as an ongoing issue and women with a strong social identity based on gender that reward the nomination of a woman. In sum, we show in this study is that nominating women as top candidates of the party makes a difference and political parties can win female (but also male) voters to vote for their party.</p><p>The results from the observational and experimental analyses have important implications for understanding the role that gender plays in attracting voters to parties. Importantly, as there is some evidence that having a female top-candidate seems to also attract male voters, parties would not necessarily sacrifice appealing to a broader electorate by nominating a female leader. However, in future research, it will be important to expand the analysis to other contexts to determine if these findings are specific to the German context or the time period of the analyses.</p></div>

The recruitment takes place through external websites. Surveys are integrated on a daily basis on more than 25,000 unique URLs via a network of several dozen highly popular sites of media partners, email providers and numerous private users and blogs, which have different thematic focuses in order to recruit respondents. Unlike most other online access providers, Civey does not provide a monetary incentive, but respondents are motivated to participate in the survey by providing them with exclusive access to the weighted survey results. In order enter the panel, participants have to provide information on a number of sociodemographic characteristics such as gender and age. Civey also uses a number of technical, statistical and content-related plausibility checks such as the user's mouse movements, the click behavior and speed of participation, as well as inconsistent answers. For their own analyses, Civey draws on a number of weighting techniques that are explained in detail in <ref type="bibr">(Richter, Gerrit; Wolfram, Tobias; Weber, N.d.)</ref>.  </p></div>

Analysis for the female and male subset were conducted within the same package, thus observation numbers are constant, since the package's functions subset a survey by setting the weight of excluded observations to zero. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>J Effects by day analysis</head><p>In addition to the main analysis of this paper, we conducted an analysis comparing the treatment effects by day over the four day treatment period. The results comparing the estimated treatment effects on the intention to vote for the Greens as well as the turnout intention are presented in Figures J.1 and J.2.</p><p>The results in Figure J.1 show that the effect on the intention to vote for the Greens stays significant on all four treatment days in all subsets except on survey day 7 for the women subset. There is a drop in effect size for all three subsets on that day. Figure <ref type="figure">J</ref>.2 indicated that especially on the first day after treatment, there was a statistically significant negative impact on the turnout intention of respondents. Over the following days, the effect size decreased across all segments, however.

(2021)</ref>. The survey is nationally representative according to gender, age and region. The population of interest consists of all German citizens aged 18 to 75 years. The survey was fielded using the online access panel of the survey company Respondi. Respondi relies on online channels and offline channels to recruit new panelists for its online panel. After completing a profiling questionnaire covering basic sociodemographic information, panelists are then invited to participate in surveys.</p><p>Respondi compensates its panelists for completing the survey.</p><p>The above described survey did not include an item on voting intention for the 2021 election, but a battery of propensity to vote (PTV) items was included in the questionnaire.</p><p>Respondents were asked to indicate how likely they would vote for all of the major parties in Germany on a scale from 1-10. Their voting intention was approximated by considering the party that respondents gave the highest score to be their most likely vote choice.</p><p>Ties were broken at random and respondents who answered 0 for all major parties were considered other parties' voters or non-voters.   </p></div>			</div>
