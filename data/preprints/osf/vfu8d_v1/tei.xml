<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction -challenges to political inclusion</head><p>In the summer of 2024, the nomination of Kamala Harris brought much euphoria to the Democrats in the US-election race 1 . Does some of that enthusiasm come from women's, Black and Asian American's eagerness to vote for in-group politicians? When Harris was appointed running mate of Joe Biden in 2020, some political commentators understood that as a strategy to attract more women and voters of color<ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">foot_1</ref> , in line with extensive US-literature supporting that voters favour their in-group (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">English, Pearson, and Strolovitch 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Schwarz and Coppock 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr">van Oosten et al. 2024a)</ref>. Is in-group voting a generalizable trend that extends beyond the idiosyncrasies of US-elections? In Europe, it remains unclear whether/which voters favour in-group politicians. In this paper, I explore the role of 'descriptive representation' i.e. whether a politician and voter share the same descriptive characteristics <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Pitkin 1967)</ref>, examining which voters tend to favour their in-group (based on shared religion, migration background, and gender) from both majority and minority perspectives in France, Germany and the Netherlands.</p><p>Social Identity Theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">(Tajfel and Turner 1979)</ref> posits that humans tend to exhibit ingroup favoritism, as commonly referenced in experimental studies about descriptive representation of minorities (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Snagovsky et al. 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Cammett, Kruszewska-Eduardo, and Parreira 2021)</ref>. The literatures on gender affinity voting <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Dolan 2008</ref>) and ethnic bloc voting <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Bergh and Bjørklund 2011)</ref> are sizable and established, while the literature on Muslim affinity voting is small but growing (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Azabar et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Heath et al., 2015)</ref>. These literatures formed the basis for pre-registering<ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">foot_2</ref> hypotheses stating that minorities and women prefer their in-group.</p><p>The outcomes of this research were not completely as expected. I find that instead of minorities, majorities are just as, if not more, likely to favor in-group politicians, though both groups care most about shared policy. The absence of in-group favoritism among minorities aligns with a less often cited line of argumentation in Social Identity Theory, which posits that "in-group favoritism is far from universal" and depends on social status <ref type="bibr">(Tajfel and Turner 1979, 43)</ref>. The influence of social status on in-group favoritism remains underexplored among researchers who cite Social Identity Theory (except <ref type="bibr">Haslam, 2001, p. 21;</ref><ref type="bibr">Jardina, 2019b)</ref>. High-status groups are more likely to favor their in-group, while lowstatus groups have incentives to favor the high-status out-group in some cases as well (ibid).</p><p>The independent impacts of both "descriptive," i.e. "being like" and "substantive representation," i.e. "standing for" <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Pitkin 1967</ref>) are challenging to investigate and compare due to their interconnected nature. In many cases, descriptive leads to substantive representation because politicians tend to support policies that resonate with their in-group <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Dietrich and Hayes 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Tate 2003)</ref>. Therefore, I employ conjoint experiments <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Hainmueller, Hopkins, and Yamamoto 2014)</ref> and randomize descriptive and substantive representation independently from one another. Previous conjoint experiments on voter and politician race/ethnicity reveal in-group preferences <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Aguilar et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Adida 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Lemi and Brown 2019)</ref>. However, these studies do not cover substantive representation nor religious identity in Europe, where minoritized groups in France, Germany, and the Netherlands often have a migration background in Muslim-majority countries.</p><p>Standard sampling strategies would not yield enough minority participants for statistical analyses <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Font and Méndez 2013)</ref>. Moreover, strict European privacy regulations limit the availability of sampling frames for racial/ethnic and religious minorities in the European context <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">(Simon 2017)</ref>. To overcome these challenges, I surveyed a large sample of Kantar-panelists and used a mini-survey to oversample voters from France, Germany, and the Netherlands with a migration background in Turkey (France, Germany, and the Netherlands), North Africa (France), Sub-Saharan Africa (France), the Former Soviet Union (Germany), Surinam (the Netherlands), and Morocco (the Netherlands). I sampled a high number of minority respondents, with 1889 out of a total N of 3058 respondents having a migration background, of which 649 self-identify as Muslim.</p><p>The findings suggest that in-group favoritism revolves around religion the most. Nonreligious voters are slightly more likely to prefer their in-group and dislike the Muslim outgroup than Muslims are to do the same. However, we find that voters with a migration background favor politicians without a migration background. Most significantly, the results show that voters overwhelmingly prefer substantive over descriptive representation, indicating that policy matters more than identity. Yet majority in-group favoritism reveals itself in policy positions as well; non-religious voters are the least likely to vote for politicians who stand for policies that Muslim voters tend to agree with more than non-religious voters do. The antagonistic treatment of Muslim politicians and Muslims preferred policy impedes the meaningful representation of Muslims, creating difficult dilemmas to fostering an inclusive political landscape where diversity of policy and identities can thrive <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Dancygier 2017)</ref>. The implications of this paper's conclusions are immense. Muslim politicians are electorally incentivized to actively speak out against the policy positions Muslims tend to prefer, garnering representation that is not substantive but suppressive <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Aydemir and Vliegenthart 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">2022)</ref>, which leads to feelings of betrayal and misrepresentation amongst Muslims <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Akachar, Celis, and Severs 2017)</ref> and ultimately leaving minority voters feeling unseen and unheard in the political systems we call our democracies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theory -positive distinctiveness and in-group favoritism</head><p>The outcomes of this research were somewhat surprising to me. Before I gathered the data for this paper, I expected minority and woman voters to prefer in-group politicians over their out-group counterparts in an effort to achieve, what Social Identity Theory calls, positive distinctiveness through in-group favoritism <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">(Tajfel and Turner 1979)</ref>, the tendency to seek a favorable comparison of one's self (positive distinctiveness) through preferring members of one's own group (in-group favoritism) <ref type="bibr">(Haslam 2001, 21)</ref>. Indeed, there is much literature on the importance of descriptive representation for minorities <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Mansbridge 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b119">Young 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b118">Williams 2000)</ref> and I expected minority voters to follow these same lines of thought. I, therefore, pre-registered hypotheses stating that minorities (voters with a migration background, Muslims and women) prefer their in-group over their out-group (Hypotheses 1a,b,c). Even though I found very limited evidence for all three of these hypotheses, I still see it as important to outline how I came to these expectations prior to gathering the data because it speaks to the literatures that helped form my expectations . I had mistakenly assumed that in-group favoritism is a universal phenomenon, despite the pioneers in Social Identity Theory specifying specific conditions under which this occurs <ref type="bibr">(Tajfel and Turner 1979: 36)</ref>. After presenting H1a, b and c, I highlight how individuals can be incentivized to consider alternative strategies to achieve positive distinctiveness without in-group favoritism and the role social status plays in these dynamics. I also outline the mechanisms that can lead to these alternative strategies, with a stronger preference for substantive over descriptive representation as an outcome, culminating in a hypothesis that contrasts identity and policy, suggesting that sharing the same policy position is ultimately the most important driver for vote choice.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Migration background</head><p>In the US, evidence shows that shared ethnic/racial identification influences voting choices for candidates <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Burge, Wamble, and Cuomo 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Schildkraut 2017)</ref>. Similarly, studies outside the US also suggest co-ethnic preferences in politics <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Poertner 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Aguilar et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Chauchard 2016)</ref>. In Europe, ethnicity is typically measured through migration background. Causes of voters preferring a shared migration background are concerns over immigration-related topics <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Bergh &amp; Bjørklund, 2011)</ref> and the concentration of immigrants in a particular neighborhood <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">(Vermeulen et al., 2020)</ref>. Other mechanisms mediating a coethnicity-effect are the assumed greater societal respect the in-group will receive <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Ruedin 2009)</ref>, showing the public your group has "ability to rule" <ref type="bibr">(Mansbridge 1999, 628)</ref>, a "survival strategy" when faced with a lack of societal acceptance (hooks 1995 as cited in <ref type="bibr">Lemi &amp; Brown, 2019, p. 272)</ref>, targeting by political parties <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Goerres, Mayer, and Spies 2020)</ref> and the assumption that descriptive representation will lead to substantive representation <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Cutler 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Arnesen, Duell, and Johannesson 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Lerman and Sadin 2016)</ref>. That is why I prereg<ref type="foot" target="#foot_3">foot_3</ref> istered the following hypothesis: H1.a. Racial/ethnic minority respondents prefer politicians of their own racial/ethnic minority group to politicians of a different group.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Religion</head><p>Cross-sectional research shows that Muslims are more likely to vote for Muslims <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Azabar, Thijssen, and van Erkel 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Heath, Verniers, and Kumar 2015)</ref>, not necessarily because of their faith itself, but because of the exclusion they experience as a Muslim <ref type="bibr">(Azabar, Thijssen, and van Erkel 2020, 8)</ref> for which there is clear evidence on the labor market <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Fernández-Reino, Di Stasio, and Veit 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b115">Weichselbaumer 2020)</ref>. As far as I know, there have not been any candidate experiments with Muslim politicians conducted on the European mainland (for US and UK examples see Bai 2021; Campbell and Cowley 2014), the only candidate experiment measuring voting likelihood I know finds a strong negative bias against Arab politicians <ref type="bibr">(Dahl and Nyrup 2021, 209)</ref> in which "Arab" might serve as a proxy for "Muslim." People often assume that individuals with a background in Muslim-majority countries are automatically Muslim <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">(Di Stasio et al. 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Otjes and Krouwel 2019)</ref> which is why I explicitly disentangle migration background and religion. Over the last two decades, Islam has become a severely politicized topic <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Fleischmann, Phalet, and Klein 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Schmuck and Matthes 2019)</ref>, exacerbated by the fact that Islam is seen as an obstacle to integration, mostly justified through political liberalism and a rejection of religious fundamentalism <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Helbling and Traunmüller 2018)</ref>. Amongst Muslims, politicization of Islam can lead to rejection of stereotypes <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">(Verkuyten and Yildiz 2009)</ref>, stronger collective identity and identity-threat among Muslims <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Frey 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Lajevardi and Oskooii 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b113">Voas and Fleischmann 2012)</ref>, causing Muslim voters to prefer Muslim politicians. That is why I preregistered<ref type="foot" target="#foot_4">foot_4</ref> the following hypothesis:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H1.b. Muslim respondents prefer Muslim politicians to non-religious and Christian</head><p>politicians.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Gender</head><p>Research on the "gender affinity effect" <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Dolan 2008)</ref>, the tendency for women to vote for woman politicians, has mixed results. Some studies find that women reward woman candidates <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Brians 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">van Erkel 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Kirkland and Coppock 2018)</ref> while others find no significant differences <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Cargile and Pringle 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Coffé and von Schoultz 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr">Cowley 2013, 148)</ref> and some finding women punish woman candidates <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Bauer 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Eggers, Vivyan, and Wagner 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Mo 2015)</ref>. The mixed results of individual studies may be because when discussions about underrepresentation of women are prominent, women are more likely to vote for woman candidates, but when these discussion are not salient women refrain from doing so <ref type="bibr">(Campbell and Heath 2017, 227)</ref>. Some researchers explain a possible "gender affinity" through the assumption amongst voters that woman politicians are more likely to share their policy views on issues such as healthcare and women's rights <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Holman, Merolla, and Zechmeister 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Lau and Redlawsk 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr">Schneider and Bos 2016, 286)</ref>. A metaanalysis found that both men and women prefer woman politicians, but women slightly more so than men <ref type="bibr">(Schwarz and Coppock 2022, 9)</ref>. That is why I pre-registered<ref type="foot" target="#foot_5">foot_5</ref> the following hypothesis: H1.c. Women prefer woman to man politicians.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Alternative strategies to achieve positive distinctiveness without in-group favoritism</head><p>Social Identity Theory proposes that individuals use three possible strategies to achieve positive distinctiveness: individual mobility, social creativity, and social competition. The choice of strategy depends on various factors such as the group's social status, belief in social mobility or change, the permeability of group boundaries, perceived security of group relations, and the perceived homogeneity/heterogeneity of the out-group. In the following section, I will outline how minorities and women may prefer their in-group only under certain conditions, and sometimes even prefer the out-group, whereas high-status groups tend to prefer their in-group under all conditions. The experimental design in which I also randomize policy positions enables respondents to abstain from letting in-group or outgroup favoritism influence their vote choice, and I will discuss when and why this is most likely to occur.</p><p>Low-status groups, such as voters with a migration background or Muslims, can use the three strategies to achieve positive distinctiveness in different ways. Some groups may perceive their boundaries as permeable, for instance because they have a name or appearance that makes them pass as part of the high-status out-group. This could be the case amongst German citizens with a migration background in the Former Soviet Union or Maghrebi French with fair skin and a French name. If that is the case, they will be likely to strive for individual mobility to join the high-status group, leading to out-group favoritism through accepting the out-group's superiority. Other groups may perceive their boundaries as impermeable, possibly due to having a ethnoracially distinct name or black skin. This may be the case amongst citizens with a migration background in Turkey or French citizens from Sub-Saharan Africa. In that case, boundaries are impermeable. If group relations are seen as legitimate and stable, individuals will try to achieve positive distinctiveness through social creativity by redefining the dimensions of group comparison or attributing different meanings to current comparative dimensions <ref type="bibr">(Haslam 2001, 25)</ref>, think of Muslim women in Europe countering common stereotypes of themselves as complacent and docile ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">van Es 2019)</ref>. This redefinition of group membership coincides with avoiding a direct challenge to the out-group's superiority. If group boundaries are perceived as impermeable and status differences as illegitimate and/or unstable, low-status groups are more likely to choose social competition, leading to direct and open in-group favoritism <ref type="bibr">(Haslam 2001, 25)</ref>, also known as "fighting fire with fire" in the case of Muslim voters voting for a political party advocating for and run by Muslims in the Netherlands, DENK <ref type="bibr">(Loukili, 2021a</ref><ref type="bibr">(Loukili, , 2021b))</ref>. In summary, not all low-status groups favor their in-group.</p><p>For high-status groups, the same three strategies exist, but they always lead to ingroup favoritism. If group boundaries are perceived as permeable, high-status groups expect low-status groups to exert individual mobility and join them. If not, high-status groups may argue that low-status groups are guilty of causing their own inferiority. If group boundaries are perceived as impermeable, legitimate, and stable, high-status group members may exhibit "magnanimity" while engaging in latent discrimination and covert repression <ref type="bibr">(Haslam 2001, 26)</ref>, which may be the case amongst high-status groups claiming to be color-blind <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">(Tiberj and Michon 2013)</ref>. If a high-status group perceives group relations as unstable and threatening, they may resort to supremacist ideologizing, conflict, open hostility, and antagonism by directly promoting the out-group's inferiority <ref type="bibr">(Haslam 2001, 26)</ref>, as is the case with some members of populist radical right parties <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Kešić and Duyvendak 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Kortmann, Stecker, and Weiß 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">van Oosten 2023b;</ref><ref type="bibr">2024a)</ref>. Thus, for low-status groups, the choice of strategy depends on various factors and may lead to different outcomes. For high-status groups, all strategies lead to in-group favoritism.</p><p>With regard to political representation, low-status groups might exhibit social creativity to redefine what representation means to them by leaning less on valuing descriptive representation, but by caring about substantive representation more, so as to not challenge the outgroup's superiority. Meanwhile, high-status groups might also exhibit social creativity by exhibiting how big-hearted they are by showing that policy matters more to them and that they are not racist, but colorblind and moreover, value policy over identity in political representation. Indeed, although there is not much research comparing the descriptive and substantive representation directly, the few existing studies find that policy matters more than identity <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Holman, Merolla, and Zechmeister 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Schneider and Bos 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Goodyear-Grant and Croskill 2011)</ref>, such as when researchers add partisanship to the experimental design and find that it "crowds out" identity <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Kirkland and Coppock 2018)</ref>, even in within-party leadership races, arguably a least likely case <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">(Wauters et al. 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Baron, Lauderdale, and Sheehy-Skeffington 2023)</ref> . A major caveat of the above studies is that they do not oversample minority groups and therefore mostly study the white majority.</p><p>Nonetheless, I pre-registered the following hypothesis: H2. Respondents prefer politicians with similar policy positions to politicians with similar descriptive characteristics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Case and methods -oversamples and conjoints in France, Germany and the Netherlands</head><p>I conducted this research in France, Germany and the Netherlands, three countries with key differences. In France, there is a strong emphasis on citizenship, secularism and a strong division between church and state, there are no religious parties in the political landscape of France <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Kuru 2008</ref>) and low minority representation in politics <ref type="bibr">(Hughes 2016, 560)</ref>. In Germany, Christian political parties have had a longstanding presence <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(Schotel 2022)</ref>, there is an intermediate level of minority representation in politics <ref type="bibr">(Hughes 2016, 560)</ref> and the approach towards Muslims is characterized by the history of integration of guestworkers <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">(Yurdakul 2009)</ref>. The Netherlands has a host of Christian parties <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Kešić and Duyvendak 2019)</ref>, a tradition of high minority representation in politics <ref type="bibr">(Hughes 2016, 560)</ref>, increased by the emergence of a political party run by Muslim parliamentarians and voicing Muslim interests in 2017, DENK <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">(Vermeulen et al. 2020)</ref>. All three countries have a history of parliamentarians from mainstream and populist radical right parties espousing Islamophobic rhetoric, with France and the Netherlands having a longer and more vociferous history of populist radical right parties and Germany being relatively new to the game and taking on a comparatively less strident tone <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Brubaker 2017)</ref>.</p><p>I oversampled respondents with specific migration backgrounds to make group-specific statistical inferences <ref type="bibr">(Font and Méndez 2013, 48)</ref> and chose minoritized groups: numeric minorities that state experiencing discrimination to the largest extent (FRA: European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights 2017, 31). In France, the oversampled groups of ethnic minority citizens consists of French citizens with a North-African (Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria), Sub-Saharan African (Niger, Mauritania, Ivory Coast, French Sudan, Senegal, Chad, Gabon, Cameroon, Congo) and Turkish background. In Germany, I oversampled German citizens with a Turkish and Former Soviet Union (FSU) background. In the Netherlands, I oversampled Dutch citizens with a Turkish, Moroccan and Surinamese background. Some groups have come to France, Germany or the Netherlands as a result of the colonial ties between host and home country, some came as guest workers (FRA: European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights 2017, 93). I also oversampled French citizens with a Turkish background and German re-migrants from the FSU. Some, but not all, of the oversampled migration backgrounds are countries with Muslim-majority populations <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Phalet, Baysu, and Verkuyten 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b111">Verkuyten and Yildiz 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Dangubić, Verkuyten, and Stark 2020)</ref> Respondents received so-called "LifePoints" (France and Germany) or "Nipoints" (the Netherlands) for the completion of the survey. With these points, respondents can periodically convert their saved points to an online gift card. The survey took about fifteen minutes to complete, which translated to an equivalent of two euros in gift card value. I ended up with the following number of respondents in each group: Table <ref type="table">1</ref> I assessed migration background by inquiring about the birthplaces of respondents' mothers and fathers. It was necessary to ask this question first for sampling purposes. To minimize potential ordering effects on the data, I randomized the order in which respondents viewed the policy questions and experimental profiles. To mitigate acquiescence bias, where respondents tend to agree with statements, I randomized the wording of the policy questions. This approach had the added advantage of aligning with the policy positions expressed by the politicians in the experimental profiles. I measured respondent on a scale from 0 to 10 and counted a respondent as agreeing with the statement if they answered 6-10 and disagreeing if they answered 0-4. I did not find any additional effects in analyses with (only) respondents who answer 5, see appendix 3. In the experimental profiles, I randomized politician migration background, religion, gender and policy position, using conjoint experiments <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Hainmueller, Hopkins, and Yamamoto 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Hainmueller, Hangartner, and Yamamoto 2015)</ref>. See Table <ref type="table">2</ref> for the full list of randomized attributes and values that made up the profiles of the politicians. After presenting two politicians I asked the respondent: "which politician are you most likely to vote for?" See image 1. I repeated this three times, resulting in six profile-views per respondent. I included religion as the final variable to measure, as it is typically considered an exogenous variable that is less likely to change based on the preceding questions. Kantar had already gathered data on respondent gender. I listed all survey questions in appendix 1.</p><p>Table <ref type="table">2</ref> Image 1 I analyze and present the data using marginal means because I compare different subgroups and wish to avoid confusing readers with different reference categories <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Leeper et al., 2019)</ref>. I present mostly voting likelihoods. A statistically significant finding does not majority preference for that attribute, but that an individual is more likely to vote for the a politician with that attribute <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Abramson, Kocak, and Magazinnik 2022)</ref>. When the outcomes in are consistent in all three countries, I present visuals of the pooled data, with separate visuals for each country in appendix 2. When I make statements about the general population, I use population weights to weight down the impact of respondents with a migration background to the proportion they are in the population. In all analyses, I cluster the standard errors at the level of the respondent. I prepared the data using R-package "tidyr" (Wickham 2020), analyzed it using marginal means with R-package "cregg" <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Leeper &amp; Barnfield, 2020)</ref> and linear models using "miceadds" <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Robitzsch, Grund, and Henke 2021)</ref>, and visualized it with Rpackage "ggplot2" <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">(Wickham et al. 2020)</ref>. I pre-registered the hypotheses, see appendix 7</p><p>for an anonymized version of the pre-registration.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis -shared policy or identity</head><p>To answer who favor in-group politicians, I systematically examine each of the preregistered hypotheses, and I supplement these analyses with additional exploratory ones. In general, voters are most likely to prefer politicians with whom they share the same policy position, instead of politicians with whom they share the same identity. However, when running subgroup-analyses, I find that some groups are more likely to engage in in-group favoritism than others. I observe in-group favoritism based on religious and migration backgrounds, but not on gender. First (H1.a), I discuss how voter and politician migration background affects voting. Second (H1.b), I examine the influence of sharing the same religious affiliation on voting decisions. Third (H1.c), I scrutinize the impact of sharing the same gender on voting. Finally (H2), I analyze how voters evaluate politicians with whom they do and do not agree. For all full model results, see appendix 6.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> (for all full model results, see appendix 6, page 20 -for sample sizes, see table 1) depicts the testing of hypothesis H1.a., which posits that respondents from racial/ethnic minority groups exhibit a preference for politicians from the same group. Using migration background as a proxy for minority status, I find no evidence to support this hypothesis. In other words, none of the voter groups with migration backgrounds displayed a significant preference for politicians from their own background over those from different backgrounds. Accordingly, I reject hypothesis H1.a.</p><p>Despite the lack of support for hypothesis H1.a., several noteworthy findings emerged from the analysis. Moroccan-Dutch voters in the Netherlands are the only minority group to display a preference for politicians from their in-group, although this preference did not reach statistical significance. Similarly, German and Dutch voters without migration backgrounds were more likely to vote for politicians from their own subgroup, but this tendency, too, fell short of statistical significance. In contrast, French voters without migration backgrounds exhibited a significant preference for politicians from their own group compared to one out-group, with a 51 percent likelihood of voting for their in-group, compared to a 44 percent likelihood of voting for Turkish politicians. Finally, French voters with a migration background in North-Africa significantly prefer politicians from their own group (53 percent) over politicians from Sub-Saharan Africa (46 percent).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 1</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> (for all full model results, see appendix 6, page 21 -for sample sizes, see table 1) highlights another notable outcome. When combining all subsets of voters with and without a migration background and comparing the likelihood of voting for politicians with or without a migration background, I observe that voters with migration backgrounds exhibit a significantly higher voting likelihood for politicians without migration backgrounds (54 percent) than for politicians with (49 percent). Figure 3 (for all full model results, see appendix 6, page 22 -for sample sizes, see table 1) illustrates the results of hypothesis H1.b., which contends that Muslim respondents prefer Muslim politicians over non-religious and Christian politicians. This hypothesis receives support only in the Netherlands, where Muslim voters demonstrate a significantly higher likelihood of voting for a Muslim politician (58 percent) than for a Christian (45 percent) or non-religious politician (46 percent). In France and Germany, however, I reject this hypothesis. In France, Muslim voters exhibit nearly identical levels of support for Muslim,  In Germany and the Netherlands, non-religious voters are most likely to vote for nonreligious politicians (55 percent and 56 percent respectively) and least likely to vote for Muslim politicians (44 percent and 42 percent respectively), with Christian politicians occupying an intermediary position (51 percent in both countries).</p><p>Additional analyses reveal that, across the three countries, non-religious voters are slightly more likely to prefer their in-group and to dislike the Muslim out-group, see appendix 4. Despite the high effect sizes observed for Muslims' in-group preferences, the effect sizes were larger for non-religious voters, and non-significant for Muslim voters who vote for non-religious politicians. In other words, non-religious voters, rather than their Muslim counterparts, are slightly more inclined to engage in in-group favoritism.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 3</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref> (for all full model results, see appendix 6, page 22 -for sample sizes, see table 1)</p><p>shows the testing of hypothesis H1.c. in which I state that women prefer woman to man politicians. Contrary to the hypothesis, neither man nor woman voters exhibit a significant preference for man or woman politicians. Therefore, I reject hypothesis H1.c. This result is consistent across all three countries, as shown in appendix 2b. In the figure below, I therefore present stacked data from France, Germany, and the Netherlands. I conducted additional analyses to investigate whether there were any intersectional effects of migration background, religion with gender, but I found no consistent evidence for such effects.</p><p>Similarly, when I examined the intersection of religion, migration background, and gender on both politicians and voters, I did not find any significant intersectional effects either.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 4</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref> (for all full model results, see appendix 6, page 23 -for sample sizes, see table 1) presents the outcomes of hypothesis H2, which examines whether respondents prefer politicians with similar policy positions or similar descriptive characteristics. The weighted outcomes show that policy agreement is more important to voters than sharing s imilar descriptive characteristics, by far. Voter have a 67 percent probability of voting for a politician when they share their policy stance, against 33 percent when they do not.</p><p>Although sharing the same religion is also important to voters, policy positions are much more critical. Irrespective of which religion, sharing the same religion leads to a voting likelihood of 55 percent, while not sharing the same religion reduces the likelihood to 48 percent. Sharing the same migration background and gender or not does not reveal any statistically significant differences.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 5</head><p>In Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref> (for all full model results, see appendix 6, page 23 -for sample sizes, see table 1), I present the voting likelihoods per policy position. The most important conclusion is that politicians who support combatting climate change and regulating equal pay for equal work receive the highest voting likelihood from like-minded voters. On the other hand, the lowest voting likelihood comes from voters who support same-sex adoption when confronted with politicians who oppose it (in France, the policy position on Islam receives a slightly lower voting likelihood, as detailed in appendix 2c). The policy position on immigration reveals the most divisive outcomes across all three countries, where agreeing or disagreeing with the policy has a significant impact on voting likelihood. While the policy position on Islam is also divisive, this is only the case in France and the Netherlands, not in Germany. On personal attitudes, Muslim voters barely differ from non-religious voters (less than one point, see appendix 5) taxing the rich, supporting the unemployed, combatting climate change, raising fuel prices and gender equality. Non-religious and Muslim voters differ the most (more than one point, see appendix 5) on religious freedom for Muslims, followed by samesex adoption and immigration. These are exactly the issues on which politicians receive the lowest voting likelihoods from the general population. I will discuss the implications of this finding in the discussion-section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 6</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion and conclusion -challenges to descriptive and substantive representation</head><p>Who favor in-group politicians? In general, I find shared policy is far more important to voters than shared identity (Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>) showing that identity compared to policy plays a limited role amongst voters on a whole. Nonetheless, I also reveal differences in voting likelihood based on sharing the same religion and migration backgrounds, but not on gender. Muslim voters in the Netherlands exhibit a preference for Muslim politicians over non-religious and Christian politicians, but this does not hold in France and Germany (Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>). The preference of non-religious voters for non-religious over Muslim politicians, however, holds across all three countries, though always with Christian politicians taking an intermediate position (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>). Moreover, individuals with a migration background tend to align themselves more with the high-status out-group, politicians without a migration background, than with politicians with a migration background (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>) even when that migration background is the same as their own (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). This research challenges the common assumption that in-group favoritism is specifically a characteristic of minority groups. Contrary to popular beliefs, but in line with the reasoning of Social Identity Theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">(Tajfel and Turner 1979)</ref>, I reveal that the non-religious majority tends to exhibit favoritism towards their own group and display disfavor towards others slightly more than Muslim minorities favor their in-group, while minorities with a migration background even prefer their out-group.</p><p>There are several important caveats and implications for further research. Firstly, the eight policy positions randomized in the experiment do not cover the entire policy field, warranting the inclusion of other issues that could better capture Muslim or Islamophobic interests. Secondly, when confronted with a Muslim politician, individuals may rely on heuristics, stereotypes, or cognitive shortcuts to form their opinions about policy positions <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Portmann 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Lau and Redlawsk 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Cutler 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Koch 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr">van Oosten 2022a)</ref>. This suggests that negative perceptions of Muslim politicians, even when they hold the same policy positions as non-religious politicians, may be influenced by additional policy positions and/or stereotypes that come to mind. Thirdly, it is important to understand that there might be a lack of information equivalence between non-religious and Muslim voters <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Dafoe, Zhang, and Caughey 2018)</ref>, as voters may not necessarily associate any policy positions with politicians who "do not practice any religion," potentially leading to heuristics based on projection instead of stereotyping, with more favorable outcomes for politicians who the respondent projected their own policy positions onto. Future research should explore which policy positions come to mind when voters evaluate politicians based on their religious practices or lack thereof. Fourthly, given that I used a novel oversampling method, potential issues could arise that may warrant further exploration using alternative sampling methods to validate results. Lastly, it is important to note that conjoint experiments only provide a snapshot of voters' initial impressions, and real-life campaigns may further shape their perceptions and thus voting behavior. Nevertheless, this research contributes to our understanding of Social Identity Theory and political representation.</p><p>These findings support Social Identity Theory's assertion that in-group favoritism is more likely to occur in high-status groups than in low-status groups, contradicting popular notions that suggest otherwise <ref type="bibr">(Tajfel and Turner 1979, 36)</ref>. I argue that voters with a migration background aligning themselves with high-status out-groups reflects a "social mobility belief system," as described by Social Identity Theory <ref type="bibr">(Haslam 2001, 25</ref>). This belief system implies that group boundaries are permeable, and individuals can attain mobility and access high-status groups. As a result, voters with a migration background tend to reject politicians who share the same low-status group membership and instead prefer those with French, German, and Dutch backgrounds.</p><p>According to Social Identity Theory, the in-group favoritism amongst Muslims, particularly in the Netherlands, points more towards evidence of a "social change belief system" in which group boundaries are perceived as impermeable <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">(Tajfel and Turner 1979)</ref>.</p><p>In situations where Muslim voters prefer their in-group and challenge the out-group's superiority (as apparent in the results from the Netherlands), this reflects the perception of impermeable group boundaries and insecure relations. They understand themselves as fixed within their religious category and reject the legitimacy of the status difference, leading to social competition. In cases where Muslim voters prefer their in-group without challenging the out-group's superiority (as in France and Germany), this reflects the perception of impermeable group boundaries and secure relations. They accept the status difference between Muslims and non-religious citizens as legitimate and stable. A reason for this difference between France and Germany on the one hand and the Netherlands on the other, could be that the Netherlands has historically seen comparatively high levels of Muslim representation <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Hughes 2016)</ref>, making Muslim politicians less incentivized to broaden their electoral appeal by distancing themselves from their in-group (van Oosten 2024b). Another reason might be that there is a political party in the Netherlands that consists of Muslim parliamentarians from Turkey and Morocco who advocate for Muslim rights, DENK <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">(Vermeulen et al. 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Otjes and Krouwel 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">van Oosten et al. 2024e)</ref> and Muslim voters in the Netherlands are, therefore, more accustomed to Muslim politicians with whom they share the same policy positions.</p><p>While I deduce from Social Identity Theory that Muslim voters tend to view group boundaries as impermeable, non-religious voters may be more inclined to see religion as a matter of personal choice, resulting in perceived highly permeable group boundaries that reflect a "social mobility belief system" <ref type="bibr">(Haslam 2001, 26)</ref>. The wording of the experiment, particularly phrases such as "practices Islam" or "does not practice any religion," may have contributed to this perspective. If non-religious voters see religion as a choice, any Muslim could opt to stop "practicing Islam" and thereby "choose individual mobility." Not "choosing" for mobility could be seen as evidence of the "out-group's inferiority" <ref type="bibr">(Haslam 2001, 26)</ref>, expressed through non-religious voters giving a consistent and significantly lower voting likelihood to Muslim over Christian and Muslim politicians, despite this perceived convertibility being highly disputed <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Meer and Modood 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Non-religious voters who perceive religion as impermeable rather than a choice, with low permeability, may be more inclined to adopt a "social change belief system." Within this belief system, the perceived legitimacy and stability of religious identity may foster social creativity, including a sense of "magnanimity" or belief in one's own goodness. This may lead to latent discrimination and covert repression, where individuals signal gender equality,</p><p>LGBTQ+ rights and anti-Semitism as a justification for being critical of Muslims, aligning with the concepts of femonationalism <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Farris 2017)</ref>, homonationalism <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Puar 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">van Oosten 2022ab;</ref><ref type="bibr">2023a)</ref> and Judeonationalism (van Oosten 2024cdef). Conversely, perceived illegitimacy and instability (such as the belief that Muslims are taking over society) may generate insecure relations in which both social creativity and social competition promote out-group inferiority <ref type="bibr">(Haslam 2001, 26)</ref>, as exemplified by supporters of replacement theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Bracke and Hernández Aguilar 2020)</ref>. All three mechanisms that Social Identity Theory outlines for high-status groups lead to in-group favoritism. There is already much research on the mechanisms underlying in-group favoritism, racism, prejudice and discrimination towards Muslims (e.g. <ref type="bibr">Fernández-Reino et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Helbling &amp; Traunmüller, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b115">Weichselbaumer, 2020)</ref> and an implication of further research is that this should be extended to the field of political representation and identity politics in Europe (as already studied in the US by <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Jardina &amp; Stephens-Dougan, 2021)</ref>.</p><p>In addition to the mechanisms proposed by Social Identity Theory, this research underscores the significance of shared policy positions as compared to shared identity in influencing voter behavior. Specifically, policy positions that advocate for gender equality and combatting climate change resonate with voters who are in favor of these issues. For instance, a candidate who champions policies promoting gender equality, such as equal pay, paternity leave, and gender quotas, is most likely to gain support from voters who share these concerns. Similarly, a candidate who prioritizes policies addressing climate change, such as renewable energy and environmental conservation, is likely to attract voters who share these priorities as well. This makes these policy areas advisable for politicians of color and Muslims who aim to expand their appeal among voter bases that share these ideas.</p><p>Extant literature suggests that party selectors from parties with voters who hold egalitarian worldviews face challenges when promoting diversity and inclusion of Muslim politicians on their party list <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Dancygier 2017)</ref>. They aim to attract voters who value diversity and inclusion, but are cautious about candidates who may not support cosmopolitan issues like gender equality (idem) or also climate change. By including Muslim politicians who are outspoken in their support for gender equality on their list, they are pursuing a cautious solution (idem). My research aligns with these intuitions of party selectors, as it demonstrates the high appreciation of politicians, regardless of their religious affiliation, who support gender equality, among those who share their views (Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref>). Moreover, irrespective of the background of the voter or politician, politicians with policy positions related to religious freedom for Muslims , opposition to same-sex adoption and immigration tend to receive the lowest voting likelihood among voters who hold opposing opinions (Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref>). For example, a candidate who advocates for policies supporting other religious freedom for Muslims, such as allowing the Islamic call to prayer to be heard in public spaces or allowing the construction of mosques, may also encounter heightened resistance from voters. Especially compared to policy positions on other topics, such as taxing the rich and gender equality. In a similar vein, a candidate who opposes same-sex adoption faces stronger backlash from voters who support LGBTQ+ rights and adoption equality as compared to disagreement on other topics. Additionally, policy positions related to immigration also generate low voting likelihoods among voters who hold opposing opinions. For instance, a candidate who advocates for strict immigration policies, such as border control and deportation, may also face a relatively low voting likelihood opposition from voters who prioritize inclusivity and diversity in immigration policies and vice versa. Religious freedoms, immigration and same-sex adoption are exactly the three issues that Muslim and non-religious voters differ on the most in their personal opinions (Appendix 5).</p><p>These outcomes underscore the challenges of implementing diversity in politics, as candidates who speak out on topics that aim to promote substantive representation for certain groups, such as Muslims, may face significant pushback from voters who do not share the same opinion. This reveals the complex dynamics at play in navigating policy positions, shared identity, and voter preferences, and the delicate balance that politicians must strike in representing diverse interests while also managing potential backlash from voters with opposing viewpoints. Notably, speaking out on topics such as gender equality and climate change lead to "representation by coincidence" (Gilens and Page 2014): yes it leads to better substantive representation of Muslim voters, but only because they happen to agree to the same extent with non-religious citizens on this topic. Exactly on those three topics on which non-religious and Muslim voters differ, immigration, Islam, and same-sex adoption, the voting likelihoods are the lowest. This contributes to "suppressive representation" in which Muslim politicians are incentivized to vocally disagree with most Muslim voters <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Aydemir and Vliegenthart 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">2022)</ref> and contribute to feelings of betrayal and misrepresentation <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Akachar, Celis, and Severs 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Anderson 1997</ref>) on the part of Muslim citizens.</p><p>In sum, 1) policy positions that exhibit divergent views between Muslims and nonreligious voters and 2) Muslim politicians often face significant pushback in politics, making it challenging to achieve descriptive, substantive and symbolic representation of Muslims. Indeed, Muslims and politicians voicing Muslim interests encounter pushback, which can result in their exclusion from political decision-making processes and limit their ability to have their voices heard. Muslims and Muslim's preferred policies are often viewed through a contentious lens in politics, with some politicians and voters expressing disfavor, further hindering the meaningful representation of Muslims in the political sphere. On a whole, a political arena in which both people who descriptively and/or substantively represent Muslims is very unlikely to emerge in this political climate. This research highlights the role of in-group favoritism expressed through identity and policy and thus contributes to our understanding of Social Identity Theory and its implications for political representation in diverse societies. I highlight the importance of addressing all citizens' feelings of representation, promoting substantive representation, and fostering a more inclusive and functioning democracy. Furthermore, recognizing representation as a moral and epistemic obligation, and promoting justice and legitimacy in the political system, underscores the significance of diverse representation in shaping a fair and equitable society for all.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>, making it possible to disentangle whether effects are either religiously or ethnically/racially driven.After running pilots and obtaining the ethics approval, see Appendix 8, I gathered data between March and August of 2020 and presented experimental profiles to 3058 citizens of France, Germany and the Netherlands, administered by survey agency Kantar Public(van   Oosten et al. 2024bcd). One important challenge in surveying ethnic/racial minority groups comes from the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), a European law legally restricting saving data on race and ethnicity (European Commission 2018). I overcame this challenge by employing a large scale filter question to the representative Kantar-panels in all three countries. I asked a very large sample to participate in a mini-survey. The first and only question of this mini-survey asks where their mother and father were born. If either one of their parents were born in a country of origin I wanted to oversample, we redirected this respondent to the full survey. If not, we either terminated the survey or redirected a small percentage to the full survey. This enabled us to form sizable groups of minority citizens for our final survey, ensuring ample diversity, a feature so often missing from survey research<ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Coppock and McClellan 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Krupnikov and Levine 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Mullinix et al. 2015)</ref>. Though there is still a chance of selection bias, I have variables to weight the data on gender, migration background, education, age, urbanization and region, and the findings are broadly the same with and without weights.</figDesc></figure>
