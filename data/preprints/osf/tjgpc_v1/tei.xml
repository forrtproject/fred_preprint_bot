<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Ideological summary scales, derived from policy position items, are prevalent in political psychology and behavioral research. However, past scholarly practice shows little to no consensus as to how many such scales (i.e., ideological dimensions) researchers should consider in order to adequately capture the main political dividing lines among mass publics. Our comprehensive literature review suggests -and extensive statistical simulations using ANES and CCES data confirm -that the optimal number of latent ideological dimensions grows indefinitely as researchers include additional issue position items in their models. Instead of increasing measurement precision, additional issue position questions thus increase uncertainty about what underlying construct they are supposed to measure in the first place. At the same time, nearly all latent ideological factors detectable within policy position data are sizably and positively correlated with one another, suggesting that ideological sub-dimensions ultimately stem from a more abstract, unifying parent dimension. We propose a Bayesian hierarchical latent variable modeling framework which seeks to reconcile the boundless, yet correlated dimensional nature of mass ideology. The proposed model estimates ideology as a higherlevel expression of correlated, lower-level building blocks, allowing researchers to simultaneously evaluate whether external predictors, such as income or gender are consistently related to specific ideological sub-dimensions (e.g., economic or socio-cultural ideology) or, instead, a generalized, uni-dimensional representation thereof. Our results underscore the potential of this approach, offering insights into the unique characteristics of different ideological sub-factors and their overarching parent dimension.</p></div>

In broad terms, statistical models of mass ideology fall into unidimensional and multidimensional varieties. Proponents of unidimensional models posit that policy preferences can, in large part, be succinctly represented by a singular, generalized left-right or liberal-conservative spectrum <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Downs 1957;</ref><ref type="bibr">Rabinowitz and McDonald 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Zaller 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr">Jost et.al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Ellis and Stimson 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr">Lauderdale et.al. 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Hare 2022)</ref>. Conversely, advocates for multidimensional perspectives contend that a solitary left-right dichotomy falls short of capturing the complex nuances within mass political preferences <ref type="bibr">(Inglehart 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr">Sibley and Duckitt 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Treier and Hillygus 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr">Feldman and Johnston 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Malka et.al. 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">Atkinson et.al. 2021)</ref>. According to this viewpoint, at least two substantially distinct ideological factors -such as those differentiating preferences for socio-cultural tolerance and economic redistribution -offer a more accurate representation of mass preferences.</p><p>Considerable academic debate surrounds the dimensional "essence" of ideology as a socio-psychological phenomenon (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Maynard &amp; Mildenberger, 2018</ref> for an overview), yet many applied researchers focus on a more pragmatic aspect of ideological dimensionality: They simply want to find the most parsimonious representation of a given set of political preferences. Lower-dimensional representations of policy position data have many desirable properties: they are easier to understand, simplify algebraic expressions, and are less likely to lead researchers into over-extrapolating information beyond the immediate sample.</p><p>Nonetheless, overly reducing dimensionality can lead to significant information loss, resulting in unduly constrained models that may overlook vital insights only discernible in higher-dimensional analyses.</p><p>Expressed more formally, given a set of 𝑘 issue positions items, applied researchers often want to find the "optimal" number of latent dimensions 𝑑 ≤ 𝑘 which reduce the complexity of original, 𝑘-dimensional space without discarding any substantively meaningful information. Researchers, in other words, want to distill as much statistical signal among a given set of items 𝑘 into as few as possible dimensions, 𝑑, while discarding as much noise as possible in the process. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref>Focusing on policy ideology, the present manuscript shows that "optimal" choices for 𝑑 likely only exist for fixed sets of 𝑘. In particular, extensive sensitivity simulations using graph-based, machine-learning dimensionality detection algorithms on policy position data from the American National Election Studies (ANES) and other data sources suggest that the most parsimonious choice for ideological dimensionality is by and large driven by the number of policy position items researchers have at their disposal. Put simply, dimensionality grows without bound as researchers select more and more issue items measuring ideology. This finding stands in stark contrast to psychometrically "better behaved" constructs like personality, for which the optimal number of latent dimensions converges rather quickly to 5-6 dimensions, no matter how many additional survey items researchers select for analysis.</p><p>At the same time, virtually all latent ideological dimensions detectable in large, nationally representative policy position data of the US public are positively and sizably correlated with one another. While distinct enough to warrant separate spatial representation, consistently positive inter-factor correlations indicate fundamental similarities shared across all latent dimensions. As a data-generating process, political ideology thus somewhat strangely exhibits both uni-and multidimensional properties: while resembling a bottomless barrel in terms of producing additional latent dimensions as a function of raw data input, it also acts like a large funnel, partially binding all such dimensions together.</p><p>In light of these findings, we propose an alternative modeling framework that aims to harmonize the uni-dimensional and multi-dimensional aspects of mass ideology. In particular, we outline a Bayesian hierarchical latent variable model which allows researchers to jointly estimate ideology as a higher-level expression of lower-level, multi-dimensional building blocks. This procedure is innovative insofar as it allows for effect estimation of external covariates simultaneously on multi-and unidimensional ideology.</p><p>Researchers can, for instance, determine if a given socio-demographic or psychological predictor, such as income, gender, or egalitarianism, is consistently related to a particular ideological dimension such as economic, socio-cultural, or racial ideology, controlling for the impact of generalized, uni-dimensional ideology. We present results of such an analysis using ANES data to showcase the potential merit of this approach.</p><p>The remainder of this manuscript is organized as follows: the next two sections introduce the core concerns about ideological dimensionality and provide a motivating example for estimation issues that arise when researchers specify different models for the ideological space. In Section 4, the results of a systematic literature analysis covering six decades of American public opinion research reveal largely heterodox practices both in the number of issue items and latent dimensions researchers have employed in modeling policy ideology. A series of graph-based machine learning simulations in Section 5 statistically confirms a key pattern found within the empirical literature: the optimal choice for latent ideological dimensionality grows without bound as researchers select additional policy position items for analysis.</p><p>At the same time, nearly all thus obtained dimensions are positively and appreciably correlated with one another. In light of these findings, we propose an alternative modeling strategy based on Bayesian hierarchical factors in Section 6, which seeks to unify the traditional distinction between multi-and uni-dimensional modeling approaches. A short discussion of the merit of understanding mass ideology as a hybrid construct, exhibiting both unidimensional and multi-dimensional qualities concludes this manuscript.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Ideology, Latent Space, and Dimensions</head><p>When referring to ideology, political scientists often conceptually evoke issue-based disagreements along a given spatial dimension. Whenever we label an actor, attitude, or issue position as "left-wing," "rightwing," "liberal," or "conservative," we implicitly state that this actor, attitude, or issue position can be located on a spatial axis together with a variety of other political objects that also relate to the same logic of (dis-)agreement <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Downs, 1957;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Converse, 1964;</ref><ref type="bibr">Ingelhart and Klingeman, 1976)</ref>. As analytic tools, ideological dimensions can help organize political actors, issues, and opinions according to how similar they are to others based on a broader selection of substantially related political considerations. In other words, by labeling politicians such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez as left-wing and Ron DeSantis as right-wing we implicitly evoke an abstract spatial direction along which we can locate each of these actors based on their overall orientation towards a diverse set of political issues.</p><p>Public opinion researchers frequently apply the same logic to model the political issue attitudes held by ordinary citizens; survey respondents who are, for instance, in favor of immigration controls, abortion restrictions, and privatized prisons are typically mapped to one end, and adherents to open borders, access to abortion, and state-run prisons are mapped to the other end of the ideological space. Ideological dimensions can thus lend meaning to collections of attitudes citizens may endorse <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Converse 1964;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Achen 1975;</ref><ref type="bibr">Ansolabehere et.al., 2008)</ref>.</p><p>A long-standing argument in American Politics holds that while political elites and party activists possess ideologically structured policy preferences <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Poole and Rosenthal 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr">Converse 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Layman and Carsey, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr">McCarty et.al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr">Ansolabehere et.al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">Layman et.al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Hetherington and Rudolph, 2015)</ref>, the same cannot be said of the general public <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Converse 1964;</ref><ref type="bibr">Kinder and Kalmoe 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Baldassari and Gelman 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">Fiorina et.al., 2011)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Kalmoe (2020)</ref>, for instance, concludes that "[p]olitical ideology is only polar, coherent, durable, and potent for a sophisticated minority -perhaps 20 -30%." However, assessments like these ultimately hinge at least in part on assumptions about ideological dimensionality. In this case, the prominent ideological innocence thesis rests on the premise that mass ideology follows the same functional form as elite ideology -i.e. along a single left-right axis <ref type="bibr">(Converse 1964, p. 12)</ref>. If mass ideology is instead organized differently, for instance by operating on more than one salient dimension, a citizenry that is highly constrained along multiple dimensions might falsely appear as ideologically innocent if ideological thinking is only assessed along a single dimension (c.f. <ref type="bibr">Treier and Hylligus, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr">Carmines, et.al. 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Consider a hypothetical libertarian -someone who holds liberal attitudes on a social issue dimension (e.g. being pro-gay marriage and pro-choice) yet harbors firmly conservative views on an economic policy dimension (e.g. being against Obamacare and state unemployment benefits). This individual will falsely appear as non-ideological on a uni-dimensional, left-right axis simply because their preferred issue configuration does not align with the unified belief system that is most commonly presented by political elites. The next section provides a more principled introduction using data from the 2016 wave of the ANES to illustrate some core concerns about the dependency between research findings and assumptions about the dimensionality of the ideological space.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Why Dimensionality Matters: A Motivating Example</head><p>Any mapping of multiple political issue preferences on a latent space requires assumptions about dimensionality. While this premise is an explicit feature of many latent variable models (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Spearman 1907;</ref><ref type="bibr">Bollen 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr">Rash 1980)</ref>, it is true even of the most elementary measurement instruments such as simple additive scales tallying the number of liberal and conservative positions a citizen endorses on a given set of political issues (e.g. <ref type="bibr">Zaller 1992, p. 23f.)</ref>. In fact, when constructing such an additive scale, researchers implicitly assume that all issue items are uniformly related to a single underlying dimension (which is measured without error). Additive scales thus represent the simplest possible, unidimensional model of mass ideology.</p><p>Perhaps less obviously, researchers also rely on an implicit model of latent dimensionality when mapping citizen's issue preferences onto a simple, orthogonal coordinate system, using a separate axis for each issue item. Such a modelling approach corresponds to an extreme version of the mulitidimensional perspective, in which each item warrants a separate spatial dimension. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">2</ref> In a strictly multidimensional model, the dimensionality of the joint attitude space is equivalent to the raw data space because each item is believed to represent a unique, non-overlapping latent construct. More importantly though, neither solution depicted in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> is ostensibly superior to the others; while lower-dimensional models condense more information than higher-dimensional alternatives, it is not obvious how much, if any, of this information should ideally be condensed. In principle, researchers can rely on a variety of selection criteria that help them better adjudicate between different specifications for latent dimensionality. They could, for example, endorse a particular model if it, more so than the given alternatives, generates empirical estimates that are more likely to generalize beyond the immediate respondent or item sample. In the next section, we express this motivation more formally and discuss the usage of data-driven techniques designed to aid researchers selecting between different models of ideological dimensionality.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Data-driven Dimensionality Estimation and Practice in Political Science</head><p>Researchers are, in principle, at liberty of collapsing any number among 𝑘 total items into any number of This mathematical reality has long prompted political scientists to employ data-driven strategies towards employing data-driven strategies that help adjudicate between different models of latent dimensionality (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Stimson 1975;</ref><ref type="bibr">Miller and Miller 1976)</ref>. This work by and large builds on earlier scholarship in quantitative psychology seeking to understand the dimensionality of fundamental psychological phenomena (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Thurstone 1934</ref>); political scientists have started using psychometric tools to estimate latent dimensions in policy position data soon after these were proposed in that field <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Kaiser 1960;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Horn 1965;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Cattell 1966)</ref>.</p><p>At their core, all data-driven dimensionality algorithms seek to optimize 𝑑 ≤ 𝑘 such that the particular set of latent factors, 𝑑 𝑘 , likely generalizes beyond the immediate sample; too many factors risk over-fitting the data and afford too much weight to idiosyncratic characteristics of the immediate sample. Conversely, too few latent factors likely under-fit the data, potentially obscuring or muffling important features of the underlying data-generating process. To paraphrase Einstein, finding the optimal number of latent dimensions amounts to making the world "as simple as possible, but no simpler".<ref type="foot" target="#foot_5">6</ref> </p><p>Reckhase ( <ref type="formula">1990</ref>) offered an influential definition of dimensionality in statistical terms, referring to it "as the minimum number of mathematical variables needed to summarize a matrix of response data." This definition points to a critical aspect of dimension reduction: as no model relying on fewer variables than the original sample can provide a perfect reproduction thereof, researchers need to establish benchmarks about what qualifies as an adequate summary of the sample characteristics.</p><p>Unfortunately, no universally accepted benchmarks exist which jointly optimize for simplicity and information retention. In practice, scholarly communities have relied on a variety of threshold statistics, including those derived from correlation matrix decomposition <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Kaiser 1960;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Horn 1965;</ref><ref type="bibr">Garrido et.al. 2013)</ref>, likelihood-based indices in factor models <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Hu and Bentler 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr">Chen et.al. 2008)</ref>, information criteria extracted from item response theory models <ref type="bibr">(Treier and Hylligus 2009)</ref>, posterior dimension distributions estimated as part of Bayesian factor analysis <ref type="bibr">(Conti et.al. 2014)</ref>, and information entropy fit measures of regularized correlation networks <ref type="bibr">(Golino et.al. 2021)</ref>.</p><p>To what extend are statistical dimensionality estimation techniques used in past research relying on ideological summary scales? Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> summarizes the results of a systematic literature analysis on ideological scale construction covering six decades of applied American political behavior and political psychology research.</p><p>In order to delineate a literature sample for this analysis, a list of keywords including "ideological summary scale[s]", "political position scale[s]", "political value scale[s]", "political issue[s]", "political preference[s]", "policy ideology," "operational ideology", and "ideological dimensionality" was supplied to the ProQuest database of academic publications (search conducted in March 2022). Only texts that were published in peer-reviewed journals or books compiled by academic publishers were retained in the sample. In addition, each manuscript must meet all of the following criteria:</p><p>1. it must conduct quantitative analysis on at least one probability sample of US adults (opt-in and convenience samples are excluded) 2. it must use at least one summary scale formed of at least two policy position or political preference items, i.e. items asking participants to normatively evaluate a particular function or role of government or to select between different policy options.</p><p>3. each ideology scale can include no more than one non-policy position item (usually symbolic ideological identities or feelings thermometer scores of salient political groups)</p><p>These inclusion criteria yielded a sample of 74 publications. Although no deliberate selection based on academic disciplines was undertaken, the final sample is heavily dominated by publications in political science (81%), followed by political and social psychology (8%), sociology (7%), and economics (4%).</p><p>Alongside meta-information such as publication outlet, date, and survey sample, we recorded the number of issue items used to build ideology scales, how many such scales (i.e. ideological dimensions) the authors constructed from these, and whether they reported to have used any statistical technique designed to infer latent dimensionality from raw data. We broadly define such techniques to include eigen-decomposition based strategies (e.g. scree-plots as part of principle components analysis), model fit comparisons between factor models of different dimensionality, and comparisons of information criteria in classical test-and item response theory models (e.g. improvements in AIC or BIC statistics).</p><p>We found 122 distinct operational ideology scales across all publications; this number exceeds the publication sample because numerous manuscripts contain more than one unique scale, often fitted to different data in a different part of the analysis. A plurality of scales feature 10 or less items but there is a substantial degree of heterogeneity in this regard (𝑆𝐷 𝑘 = 9.4); a few studies even include scales constructed from 40 or more unique items. Practices for choosing the optimal number of ideological dimensions are similarly heterogeneous: While most studies invoke uni-dimensional scales, more than half of models (51%) feature scales along more than one dimension.</p><p>In terms of statistical dimensionality detection, only about one quarter of articles (26%) report the results of any data-driven analysis designed to detect the optimal number of latent dimensions. The literature sample shows little to no evidence that usage of such techniques is related to publication year 𝑟 = -0.17; 𝑆𝐸[𝑟] = 0.12 and the number of selected issue items (𝑟 = -0.02; 𝑆𝐸[𝑟] = 0.09), and only a very very weakly correlated with the number of dimensions used in the study (𝑟 = 0.24; 𝑆𝐸[𝑟] = 0.09). The perhaps most concerning discovery, however, is depicted in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>: among the published literature, the number of selected issue items 𝑘 correlates strongly and positively with the number of ideological dimensions 𝑑 used in the same analysis (𝑟 𝑑,𝑘 = 0.51; 𝑆𝐸[𝑟 𝑑,𝑘 ] = 0.08). Picking a set of items, in other words, appears to be strongly informative of how many scales researchers construct from these. This should be reason for worry as a strong dependency between input data and "optimal" dimensionality does not help solve, but worsen the key concerns about estimate variability resulting from alternative model specifications such in the examples outlined in Section 3. Put simply, data-driven procedures optimizing for latent dimensionality (i.e., finding the best solution for 𝑑 given 𝑘) should not themselves strongly depend on the very model input specifications they are designed to optimize over (i.e., if the "best" 𝑘 is itself is determined by 𝑑). In this case, optimal solutions for latent dimensionality only exist for a fixed set of input data and are not likely to generalize beyond the immediate data researchers have at hand. To more fully evaluate this predicament, the next section investigates the statistical relationship between optimal latent dimensionality and the number of political issue items using large-n simulations based on ANES data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Dimensionality Simulations</head><p>An ideal data source for the purpose of investigating the association between number of survey items and latent dimensionality possesses a large number of unique policy position items, 𝑘, administered to a large, nationally representative sample. The 2012 wave of the ANES features an unprecedented number of 𝑘 𝑚𝑎𝑥 = 74 unique policy position questions,<ref type="foot" target="#foot_6">7</ref> making it an ideal for a comprehensive statistical simulation. Appendices B and C replicate the same procedure for the ANES waves of 2000 and 2020, at slightly smaller issue item pools (𝑘 𝑚𝑎𝑥 = 42, 62), respectively. Appendix D repeats the same analysis for a non-ANES data source, using the 2018 wave of Cooperative Congressional Election Studies.<ref type="foot" target="#foot_7">8</ref> </p><p>For each of these issue item samples, we simulated ≈ 10,000 latent ideology models with item sets ranging from 𝑘 = 3 to 𝑘 𝑚𝑎𝑥 -3, using iterative process of item selection, dimensionality estimation, and scale construction. Each simulation iteration proceeds in three steps: First, a random sample from the population of unique policy position items of size 𝑘 is drawn. We next estimate a polychoric itemcorrelation matrix from this sample. A latent dimensionality detection algorithm subsequently suggest the number of latent dimensions, 𝑑, alongside a best-fitting item loading pattern. Finally, a confirmatory factor model is fit to the raw data to check for model convergence and to extract the fitted inter-factor correlation pattern.<ref type="foot" target="#foot_8">9</ref> Since estimating the optimal number of latent dimensions is by far the most complex aspect of the simulation, we describe this part in more detail below.</p><p>Across all simulations, we rely on Exploratory Graph Analysis (EGA) -a graph-based, two-stage machinelearning procedure proposed by <ref type="bibr">Gollino et.al. (2021)</ref> -to find the most parsimonious solution for latent dimensionality (see also <ref type="bibr">Gollino and Epskamp et.al. 2017</ref>). In the first stage, EGA finds the optimally sparse<ref type="foot" target="#foot_9">10</ref> representation of the item correlation matrix using Gaussian Least-Absolute-Shrinkage (G-LASSO). In a second stage, the sparse correlation matrix is passed to the Leiden community detection algorithm <ref type="bibr">(Traag et.al. 2019)</ref> with a varying set of sensitivity input parameters.<ref type="foot" target="#foot_10">11</ref> By allowing random variations within the sensitivity parameter space, the algorithm is able to identify the network community solutions associated with the lowest total information entropy. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_11">12</ref> The thus obtained number of item communities is conceptually equivalent to the optimal number of latent dimensions governing the datagenerating process. As an added benefit, membership in EGA communities propose optimal loading patterns which can be used to fit confirmatory factor models <ref type="bibr">(Gollino et.al. 2021</ref>). <ref type="foot" target="#foot_12">13</ref>The results in the upper left-hand panel of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3</ref>  whether commonly used fit criteria can be relied used to systematically distinguish between dimensionally under-and over-fitted models across the range of 𝑘. Using a reasonably strict fit criteria battery,<ref type="foot" target="#foot_13">14</ref> almost eight in ten randomly generated models fit the data extremely well. More importantly, the share of ill-fitting models above the trend-line is almost identical to the corresponding share below the trend-line (0.48 to 0.52), which further suggests that "ideal" dimensionality grows with the number of issue items.</p><p>To what extend might boundless dimensional growth simply result from population heterogeneity in terms of political sophistication or ethno-racial diversity? If unidimensionality is indeed a fundamental feature of mass ideology in the United States (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Ellis and Stimson, 2012)</ref>, such a feature may not be as easily detectable in nationally representative respondent samples which inevitably include many politically disinterested and unsophisticated individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Converse, 1964;</ref><ref type="bibr">Kinder and Kalmoe, 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Furthermore, different ethnic and racial groups might understand ideology differently, which could obscure an otherwise well-structured data generation process. We specified a series of sub-demographic analysis to test if boundless dimensional growth is unique to low education (Appendix F), low political knowledge (G), white/non-white (H) populations using the 2000 and 2012 waves of the ANES. The results strongly suggest that ideological dimensionality grows without bound across all educational and political knowledge quartiles, as well as white, and minority-only sub-samples.  What if the higher-dimensional solutions in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3</ref> simply contain a large number of co-linear factors. If this was the case, additional dimensions would offer little to no additional informational value. Conversely, others might question whether the population of ANES policy position items was well-suited to capture operational ideology as as a single, underlying construct to begin with. If these items are only weakly or quasi randomly related, they likely yield quasi-random, substantially meaningless latent dimensions. In this case, one should expect the average factor correlation to be centered at zero and obtain equally many positively as negatively correlated factors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ideology</head><p>Evidence for these methodological objections should manifest in divergent ways: if the latent factor solutions exhibited strong positive correlation all solutions encapsulate essentially identical information, or, if they exhibit no clear correlation tendency at all, the solutions would only capture highly idiosyncratic information. Intriguingly though, the bottom right panel in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3</ref> reveals that neither is the case: based on the probability density distributions of inter-factor correlations within each model with a minimum of two dimensions (which constitutes approximately 96% of the models), hardly any factor pair within the same model is negatively correlated; only a handful (&lt; 2%) approach orthogonality. Simultaneously, only very few factor solutions are very highly correlated (less than 4% are larger than 0.75). Instead, moderate association pairs between any two latent factors dominate the multi-factor space.</p><p>Panel B further illustrates that the number of latent dimensions does not display any systematic relationship with the inter-factor correlation patterns. This means that as one expands the item sample and estimate additional dimensions, latent ideological factors do not simply become more similar to one another.</p><p>Rather, the average factor correlation of r 𝑖𝑑𝑒𝑜𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑦 = 0.43 (𝑆𝐸[ r ] &lt; 0.01) suggests that the majority of solutions at least in part capture the essence of a single underlying conceptual family, albeit with a substantial degree of heterogeneity. In sum, the simulated latent factors appear dissimilar enough to warrant distinct dimensions of measured operational ideology. Nevertheless, they also demonstrate a sufficient degree of similarity, loosely linking them to the same class of constructs. In the last section, we will circle back to this finding, as it provides the basis for reconceptualizing mass ideology as a hybrid phenomenon, exhibiting both uni-and multidimensional characteristics.</p><p>Finally, one might object that boundless dimensional growth could simply be a feature -or rather, a flaw -of the dimensionality detection algorithms employed here. More specifically, these algorithms might be overly sensitive towards minute evidence for the existence of additional latent dimensions, especially for large item buckets 𝑘. To address this concern, one could ask how the unbound dimensional nature of political ideology stacks up against more well-established construct in quantitative psychology -such as personality -as 𝑘 increases? Using the identical simulation procedure, the right-hand panels in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3</ref> presents estimates for latent dimensionality and inter-factor correlation for a large, publicly available personality questionnaire featuring answers from 288 US undergraduate students on 𝑘 𝑚𝑎𝑥 = 44 items. 15   Although dimensionality estimates also initially grow rapidly here, they plateau at the widely accepted latent factor structure between 5 and 6 dimensions at 𝑘 ⪆ 25. Moreover, virtually all latent personality dimensions are nearly perfectly orthogonal to one another r 𝑝𝑒𝑟𝑠𝑜𝑛𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑦 = 0.005 (𝑆𝐸[ r = 0.0018]). 16   What consequences does boundless dimensional growth for policy ideology bode for researchers who rely on data-driven dimensionality detection algorithms in order to adjudicate between alternative models?</p><p>Reconsider the opening problem about determining which of the main presidential candidates in 2016 was ideologically positioned closer to the median voter. One unsettling implication of the present finding is that the "optimal" model for latent dimensionality is very likely a direct function of the number of issue items researchers happen to feed into their analysis. Rather than determining more broadly applicable solutions, that is detecting models that produce estimates which likely generalize beyond the immediate item and respondent sample, the simulation analysis strongly suggest that global solutions for ideological dimensionality are impossible to obtain. In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">4</ref>, we confirm this predicament by plotting the results of a large class 𝑛 ≈ 100, 000 models, each of which is calculating the perceived ideological distance between Clinton and Trump in 2016 across the sets of available political position items on both candidates 1 &lt; 𝑘 ≤ 7, while randomly allocating each set of 𝑘 along 1 &lt; 𝑑 ≤ 7 dimensions. 17</p><p>15 Data source: Ordinal Data of the Big Five Inventory <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Luo, 2005)</ref>. These data were collected as part of a the study on personality and relationship satisfaction. N = 228 undergraduate students at large, US-based public university. Used are all self-ratings on the 44 item Big Five Inventory proposed by <ref type="bibr">John et.al. (1991)</ref>. 16 In Appendix X, we cross-validate the same findings for another publicly available personality data-set <ref type="bibr">(Tunguz, 2018)</ref> at 𝑘 𝑚𝑎𝑥 = 50. This data source is based on an a massive online convenience sample administered by Open-Source Psychometrics, featuring n &gt; 1 million responses from &gt;180 countries. See https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/IPIP-BFFM/ for the item battery. 17 This simulation introduces additional variation across models by sampling a subset of 500 out of 2,700 complete-cases responses.</p><p>-5.3  The y-axis in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">4</ref> displays the variance of the thus obtained ideological distance estimates. This metric affords direct comparisons of the relative performance of each dimensionality configuration at fixed sets of items; "better-behaved" models tend to produce estimates that vary less for a given respondent and item pool. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">4</ref> shows that models generally produce estimates with the lowest possible variance whenever the bucket sizes 𝑘 exactly equals the number of latent dimensions, 𝑑. Once again, "optimal" dimensionality appears to grow without bound as researchers consider additional items in their models.</p><p>Unfortunately for researchers, this implies that data-driven benchmarks are strongly influenced by the size of the employed item bucket and thus cannot provide grounds for selecting dimensionality configurations that likely generalize beyond the immediate sample data.</p><p>Pivoting back to the comparison between personality and ideology in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3</ref>, this issue is nicely mirrored in direct comparison of the behavior of CFA-derived model fit statistics between ideology and personality.</p><p>Among the personality models, fit metrics largely succeed in flagging dimensionally under-fitted models, especially for item buckets 𝑘 ≥ 20; here, researchers would reject the lions' share of 4-dimensional solutions in favor of 5 or 6-dimensional alternatives. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_14">18</ref> As stated above, model fit is all but randomly distributed across the range of 𝑘 in the ideology simulation. For personality, but not ideology, this implies that researchers can generally expect that CFA fit systematically distinguishes between dimensionally over-and under-fitted models. In short, model fit criteria appear to perform well for dimensionally capped constructs like personality. They fail, however, in providing generalizable benchmarks for dimensionally unbound data.</p><p>The present simulation analyses, in a nutshell, show that ideological dimensionality grows without bound as researchers incorporate more information measuring it. Importantly, the same does not happen for psychometrically "better-behaved" concepts like personality; here, the number of survey items does not lead to a proportional increase beyond 5-6 latent dimensions.</p><p>At this point, some readers may inject that policy position items, particularly those fielded as part of large political attitude surveys, are not likely to have been designed to reproduce a particular dimensional structure in the first place. Survey makers must carefully evaluate various considerations, including financial ones, when crafting questionnaires designed to capture the major political dividing lines among large, heterogeneous societies. Making sure that a given policy position battery neatly reproduces a particular model of latent dimensionality -as with personality questionnaires -is almost certainly not one of them. In this sense, direct comparisons between constructs like personality and policy ideology rightfully appear ill-posed. However, the critical point is that applied researchers frequently use policy position scales as if they were dimensionally bound. Practitioners, in other words, tend to treat ideology as if it was psychometrically as well-behaved as personality. As discussed in Sections 3 and 4, this practice unfortunately leads to double ambiguity in applied settings both because empirical estimates can fluctuate considerably under alternative dimensional specifications and researchers generally lack objective standards that could help adjudicate between them (e.g., on the basis of parsimony).</p><p>However, one critical silver lining should be reiterated: While personality is constrained by a fixed number of orthogonal factors, virtually all latent dimensions identified in policy position data are strongly and consistently positively correlated with one another. Although complex enough to warrant separate spatial representation, all latent ideological dimensions seem to be tethered to an overarching, yet somewhat imprecise, uni-dimensional origin. In the last section, we suggest a blueprint for how this common information can best be utilized to model mass ideology as a data-generating processes that may be dimensionally unbound, yet partially bundled together.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Unifying multi-and unidimensional perspectives in Bayesian hierarchical factor model</head><p>The preceding sections established how empirical models of political ideology can produce contrasting outcomes depending on the model of latent dimensionality that researchers select. They also revealed that past scholarship in political science largely tended to follow the trend evident in data-driven estimates for optimal latent dimensionality -ideological dimensions grow with the number of policy position items researchers include in their models. One consequence of the dimensionally unbound nature of mass ideology is that tools designed to detect "optimal" dimensionality likely suffer from strict limitations in terms of external validity. However, the simulation analysis also strongly suggests that the boundless multidimensional space possesses an inherent degree of structure; although separate ideological factors are warranted to account for the growing complexity as researchers supply more and more policy items, nearly all latent factors appear related through sizable, unidirectional correlations.</p><p>Neither the unidimensional nor multidimensional modeling approach can individually accommodate both of these aspects. Boundless dimensional growth might support the multidimensional perspectives yet strong resemblances among the collection of latent factors point to a joint, latent origin, forcing all factors into partial alignment. Furthermore, any multi-dimensional model of finite dimensionality is ultimately incomplete as researchers working with larger item sets will likely find evidence for better-fitting, higherdimensional alternatives. We argue that a hybrid modeling approach which borrows elements from both modeling frameworks can better account for the shortcomings in either. Rather than strictly imposing a uni-or finite multi-dimensional model, the proposed framework treats mass ideology as a meta-concept which can manifest itself in a (potentially infinite) number of concrete, policy-specific dimensions which are loosely related to a general, albeit somewhat diffuse hyper-dimension.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref> outlines the blueprint for a Bayesian hierarchical factor model featuring a quasi-infinite number of area-specific sub-dimensions ("Dimension 𝑥 ") explaining the covariance structure among a given set of policy position items (labelled "I"). This modeling strategy takes advantage of the quasi-hierarchical dependency between distinct ideological dimensions (such as social, economic, and/or racial ideology) and a generalized dimension which captures the common essence among the former. The model further assumes that all of these sub-dimensions originate from a single, albeit somewhat diffuse, hyper-dimension (labeled "IDEOLOGY" in Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>). While the sub-dimension level features freely estimated loading structures (𝛾's), the uni-dimensional hyper-factor is drawn from an unweighted average across all subdimensions (i.e., the loading coefficients are constrained to unity). We believe that this modeling approach has key advantages over conventional strategies as it can flexibly be extended to accommodate any number of political position items and seamlessly integrated into dimensionality detection workflows such as the one presented in Section 5. Furthermore, the hierarchical ideology model features informative prior distributions on optional, external predictors, allowing for simultaneous effect estimations of such predictors on uni-dimensional (labeled 𝛼 in Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>) and multi-dimensional (𝛽's) expressions of ideology. Effects of external predictors such as income or racial resentment can thus be decomposed into particularities of certain sub-dimensions (such as economic or racial ideology) and effects that generalize across all dimensions. In this way, the proposed framework can be interpreted as a causal mediation model that differentiates between direct effect of external predictors w.r. to particular sub-dimensions (𝛽) and mediated effects (𝛼) that first pass through the common hyper-factor. Note that this kind of decomposition is impossible with conventional maximum-likelihood methods as the set of lower-level factors is jointly co-linear with the uni-dimensional hyper-factor under the assumption of uniform prior distributions. Informative priors hence provide a critical asset of Bayesian hierarchical models as they aid in the empirical differentiation between the common, as well as the unique, properties of every sub-dimension detectable by data-driven dimensionality algorithms.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">1 γ 12 γ 13 1 γ 22 γ 23 γ 24 γ 25 1 γ ...2 γ ...3 γ ...4 1 γ d2 γ d... γ dk 1 1 1 1 β 1 : N(0, θ) β 2 : N(0, θ) β… : N(0, θ) β d : N(0, θ) α : N(0,</formula><p>Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref> showcases one possible application of the proposed estimation strategy. Here, we present the results of a series of models featuring socio-demographic and psychological covariates which can help substantially interpret differences between ideological sub-dimensions and a unifying hyper-factor. As a data foundation, we rely on the 2000 ANES as this particular wave appears as the single most frequently used data source in the literature analysis and provides the basis for several, high-impact publications on the nature of ideology in the American public <ref type="bibr">(Lupton, et.al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Feldman and Johnston, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Treier and Hillygus 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr">Anasobelere et.al., 2008)</ref>. From this dataset, we selected a set of 𝑘 = 32 policy position items. All of these items have been used at least once in ideological scale construction among a set of 9 relatively recent, high-quality publications; 19 a number of well-established public opinion researchers, in other words, have found these particular items to be representative of the major political topics that divided the US electorate at this moment in time. Using EGA to detect latent dimensionality within this attitude set, we obtained 𝑑 = 6 optimally distinct, positively correlated ( r = 0.45; 𝑆𝐸[ r ] = 0.16) ideological sub-dimensions. Based on their respective item loading patterns, these dimensions could be labeled as 1) poverty reduction, 2) New Deal issues, 3) socio-cultural issues, 4) racial justice, 5) moral &amp; sexual chauvinism, and 6) anti-immigrant chauvinism. 20   What substantial claims can be made about these sub-dimensions and their over-arching parent factor?</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref> presents the results of a series of models fitting a series of socio-demographic and psychological predictors 21 to a joint model featuring the above-listed sub-dimensions and a single hyper-factor accounting for the common variance among these. The predictors broadly fall into two categories: the first, depicted in the top panel of Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref>, includes political partisanship, ideological self-identification, and racial resentment. Generalized ideology -i.e. the shared essence among all ideological sub-dimensions -is strongly related to each of these predictors as seen by the sizable coefficients across the top row in Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref>.</p><p>Predictors in the first category, in other words, strongly and relatively homogeneously predict the common conceptual core captured across all basis dimensions. At the same time, some of the sub-dimensions show substantial relevance over and above generalized ideology. The model for liberal-conservative self-identification, for example, predicts substantive positions on gender issues to matter above and beyond respondents' general ideological orientations. Similarly, and perhaps not surprisingly, racial resentment pulls racial conservatism and anti-immigrant chauvinism further to the right based on what 19 These works are in alphabetical order <ref type="bibr">: Ansolabehere et.al., (2006, 23 items)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Barker and</ref><ref type="bibr">Tinnick (2006, 11 items), Carmines et.al.

By contrast, predictors in the second category, which appear in the bottom panel of Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref>, show no clear relationship with generalized ideology; this can be seen by the largely zero-centered coefficients across the top row in the bottom panel. These include covariates like income, education, political knowledge, and religiosity. However, each of these predictors shows unique associational patterns across the ideological sub-dimensions. Controlling for generalized left-right orientations, income, for instance, strongly predicts conservative stances on anti-poverty issues; anti-immigrant sentiment, meanwhile, moderately decreases with income. Other predictors, such as level of education, are positively related to ideological sub-dimensions dealing with economic redistribution, yet negatively predict socio-cultural tolerance.</p><p>In sum, by combining key features from unidimensional and multidimensional model approach, the present blueprint for modeling ideology as a Bayesian hierarchical factor not only offers more flexible solutions given particular choice options for item selection and latent dimensionality, but also allows for investigations that might contribute towards a more fine-grained understanding of the socio-demographic antecedents of mass ideology.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Conclusion</head><p>Empirical research on mass ideology is intimately linked to questions about dimensionality. When assessing the degree to which citizens adopt ideologically congruent beliefs, researchers typically evoke one or more ideological dimensions as yardsticks against which to evaluate how well citizen preferences match those pre-defined standards. When studying the prevalence of ideological polarization, researchers need to make assumptions about the dimensionality of ideology to get an idea about what ideological "poles" mean in the first place. When measuring the relative ideological distance between voters and candidates, we first need to establish ideological dimensions to scale the space in which we wish to measure distances. In short, we cannot evaluate the empirical claims about mass ideology without a priori pontificating about ideological dimensionality.</p><p>Despite their ubiquity in applied research, assumptions about ideological dimensionality are themselves rarely the sole subject scrutiny. In this manuscript, we show that ostensibly inconsequential choices about the number of issue items researchers select and the number of separate scales, i.e. latent dimensions to construct from these can have a profound impact on empirical findings. More fundamentally, the present analysis uncovered a deep connection between both aspects: Meta-data on research practice from 74 high-quality research publication in American political behavior shows that researchers who select larger issue item pools tend to model the ideological space in higher dimensions. A large-scale statistical simulation analysis including all available policy-position items within high-quality public opinion surveys subsequently confirmed that this tendency approximates a fundamental feature of the American attitude space: ideological dimensionality grows without bound as one increases the number of issue positions under consideration. At the same time, virtually all latent dimensions detectable within the mass policy preference space are positively and appreciably correlated with one another; separate ideological dimensions, in other words, at least partially capture the same underlying information.</p><p>Mass ideology should therefore perhaps neither strictly be understood as a unidimensional nor multidimensional phenomenon. Instead, we argued that ideological preference more likely exists in a hybrid state characterized by distinct yet related concepts, somewhat akin to the members of an extended family.</p><p>To better differentiate the common conceptual nucleus from characteristics unique to only a subset of ideological sub-dimensions, we proposed an alternative modeling framework which allows researchers to model policy ideology simultaneously as a unidimensional or multidimensional construct.</p><p>We would like to conclude by returning to the initial question: how many dimensions are needed to faithfully capture the essence of citizens' policy preferences? Based on the present analysis, one might be inclined to say, both one and many. Such an answer, however, might appear unsatisfactory to readers who might wish for a more clear cut solution to one of the most perennial questions about the nature of mass ideology. At the same time, such clear-cut answers are already abound among the extant literature (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Maynard and Mildenberger 2018</ref> for an overview). From a purely empirical perspective, there is clear merit to both the uni-dimensional and multi-dimensional perspectives. On the one hand side, there is undeniable evidence for multi-dimensionality among the most widely cited public opinion data sources on Americans' political issue positions. On the other hand, the same data can, in principle, give rise to quasi-infinite number of positively aligned dimensions which tells us that the multi-dimensional ideological space is ultimately bound to a single, if somewhat diffuse, parent dimension.</p><p>Our view likely best aligns with a small but growing body of literature that regards ideology as a family resemblance concept (e.g., Cochraine, 2015; Gidron 2020). <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Wittgenstein (1953)</ref>, who first coined this term, argued that many social concepts, particularly those involving social cognition, embeddings, and applications, follow logic of relational resemblance: While a given pair of blood-related family members is likely to share some physical similarities such as similar shape of nose, eyes, or chin, it is nearly impossible for all family members to exhibit a single shared feature. Instead, it is the collection of shared features which differentiates one (conceptual) family from another. Our analysis shows that different ideological sub-factors such as racial, socio-cultural, or wealth-redistribution ideology exhibit numerous unique characteristics; few if any individuals are consistently liberal or conservative on all of these dimensions. Collectively however, the set of ideological factors share substantial enough similarities (in the form of consistently positive correlations) to classify them as belonging to the same conceptual family -even if the nucleus of that family remains slightly obscure under close scrutiny.</p><p>Finally, we think at least two important caveats appear in order to better put the present contribution into perspective. First, we exclusively focused the empirical part of the analysis on operational ideology -that is the summation of citizens' preferences on specific political issues and beliefs about the proper scope and function of government. Although this definition captures a large body of work on mass ideology, particularly in political science, one should certainly acknowledge other perspectives on conceptualizing and measuring ideology. Future research could extend the present definitions and conceptualizations to as scale-models of psychological conservationism <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Wilson and Patterson, 1968)</ref>    </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 Figure 1 :</head><label>11</label><figDesc>Figure 1 depicts these contrasting approaches using three issue items taken from the 2016 round of the American National Election Studies (ANES): Abortion restrictions, government spending &amp; services, and the size of the military budget.
