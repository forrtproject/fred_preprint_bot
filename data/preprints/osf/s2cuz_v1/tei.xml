<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Objective: There is a lack of research into social acceptability of a male transdermal contraceptive gel (MCG). The objective was to explore men's online accounts of a MCG and triangulate this with data from interviews with Reproductive Medical Experts to understand how the social acceptability is constructed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study Design:</head><p>The design was a two-study qualitative research project. Study 1 used Internet Mediated research on men's comments to three newspaper articles published in the United Kingdom. Study 2 utilized interviews with Reproductive Medical Experts to illustrate their perceptions and understandings of a male transdermal contraceptive gel. Both studies were analyzed using discourse analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results:</head><p>The analysis resulted in 3 discourses emerging. Study 1, 'Acceptable Among Men in Committed Relationships Only'; study 2, 'A Broad Range of Male Contraceptive Options are Necessary' and 'NES/T Developed from Hormones in Female Contraception'. These discourses were dominant and occurred in over half of the participants accounts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion:</head><p>There is a need for further options for men to take primary responsibility for contraception. The MCG was seen as relevant to those in committed relationships, with desire expressed for other new options for men in uncommitted relationships. Further, there were concerns over the side-effects both long-term and short term in study 1, with study 2 contradicting this showing that Nestorone has already safely been used in female contraceptives for over 50 years. These findings suggest that when participating in media interviews, Reproductive Medical Experts should emphasize how the MCG is derived from female contraceptives already proven safe.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Males have limited contraceptive choices, such as the condom, vasectomy or withdrawal [ 1 , 2 ]. There are several different contraceptive options for men undergoing clinical trials [see 3 ], that either inhibit sperm production, function, and/or transport [ 4 ]. There are benefits to male hormonal contraceptives such as increased bone density, functioning of muscles, and prostate health [ 5 ]. There is little research though into the social acceptance of new methods, with research overrepresenting the male contraceptive pill [see 6 , 7 ]. However, a study of British men's online accounts found men were dissatisfied with the male pill as an option for family planning [ 8 ]. This suggests that researchers should explore the social acceptance of other male contraceptive methods in clinical trials.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">Transdermal Male Contraceptive Gel</head><p>Globally, clinical trials have begun to test a male transdermal contraceptive gel (NES/T) on human participants [ 9 ]. This method involves a gel, which when applied to the skin significantly lowers sperm count to prevent conception. Specifically, Nestorone (NES) is a progestin without androgenic, estrogenic, or glucocorticoid properties 10 , when combined with Testosterone (T) it has limited side effects and acts as a contraceptive. Originally, NES and T gels were applied separately as NES gel limits the production of T and sperm count, and T gel counteracts hormone imbalances, providing a dose of synthetic T that diminishes sperm production [ 5 ].</p><p>Research on male contraceptive gels (MCGs) is limited to clinical trials and quantitative research. A 6-month study with 99 men, where 8mg of NES gel was applied to the abdomen daily and 10mg of T gel applied to the shoulders daily, found 89% achieved sperm suppression to &lt;1 million per ml of ejaculate and there was a &lt;2% risk of pregnancy [ 11 ]. Minor side effects were reported including acne and weight gain [ 12 ].</p><p>Other researches argued that compliance in a two-part contraceptive regimen would be poor therefore a combined formula was created using NES/T together [ 13 ]. In a 28-day trial with 44 men, the gel was applied to upper arms and shoulders daily. Results showed 85% of the men achieved sperm suppression of &lt;1 million sperm per ml of ejaculate.</p><p>Overall, 80% of the participants said they were satisfied with the gel, 50% reported that they would use the gel as their primary method.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">Aims and Objectives</head><p>To the best of the researchers' knowledge this is the first study exploring the social acceptance of both men's online accounts of a MCG and Reproductive Medical Experts' perceptions and understanding of the method using discourse analysis to explore how NES/T is constructed.</p><p>With little research to guide the study, the objective was to explore the phenomena using both Internet Mediated Research (IMR) and semistructured interviews. The research questions were, how do men's online accounts construct a contraceptive gel as a potential option for family planning? How do Reproductive Medical Experts, in the field of new forms of male contraceptives, perceive a male contraceptive gel?; and how do Reproductive Medical Experts, in the field of new forms of male contraceptives, understand the background around how this alternative contraceptive method developed?</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Material and Method</head><p>Two studies were conducted, first was a qualitative study, utilising IMR to collect data. IMR provides the ability to easily access the specific population to understand the perception of men 14 . Online newspaper articles discussing MCGs were sourced to examine interactive comments by male readers, this method is commonplace when researching men's health (see 15 ) and men and reproduction (see 8 ). These online spaces, provided anonymity for responders, and are believed to provide more forthcoming accounts 16 .</p><p>The second study involved semi-structured interviews with Reproductive Medical Experts. The interviews lasted on average 20 minutes, as this was the maximum time the experts could spare. The studies were conducted sequentially with the IMR study conducted first to understand if the contraceptive method was acceptable among men before interviewing experts. This was done to not waste experts time 17  and because medical professionals are often a hard to research group due to time constraints 18 . The research design used multiple data sources to triangulate the data and provide a comprehensive picture of the MCG 19 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Settings</head><p>Study 1 was conducted online using publicly available posts by United Kingdom (UK) men in the comment section of the Daily Mail.</p><p>Study 2 was conducted virtually using the platform Zoom with Reproductive Medical Experts from around the world. The video function was used during the interviews, but the video was not recorded for ethical reasons around storage of sensitive personal data. Participants provided verbal consent due to the nature of the research having to be conducted online during the COVID-19 pandemic, consent was received prior to the interviews commencing and was audio recorded. This project received ethical approval from the University REF 3604.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Participants and Sample Sizes</head><p>Study 1-The participants included in this study were UK men who responded to online newspaper articles about MCGs. An online search was completed using the LexisLibrary database, only searching UK newspapers. Using the search terms 'male contraceptive' and 'gel', the search returned 43 results. In addition, these newspapers also had to be free to access, ensuring a diverse range of accounts and that they were publicly accessible. After applying the criteria three articles remained: 'First male contraceptive GEL that can dramatically reduce sperm count is to be trialled on men (and the patch test isn't where you might expect it to be!)' Mail Online (Daily Mail) <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Tanner, 2017)</ref>.</p><p>'New male birth control gel that rubs into men's shoulders "could increase MUSCLE but also trigger acne flare ups"', Mail Online (Daily Mail), <ref type="bibr">(Chalmers &amp; Deputy, 2018)</ref>, and, 'Male contraceptive that can be rubbed on the arms and legs to halt sperm production is revealed as academics launch hunt It also stated that if successful, the gel will be available in three to five years. The articles included 667 comments total, and a purposive sampling method was used to identify those respondents accounts of the MCG's 23 . The same inclusion criteria as Wilson 10 (2018) was used; participants that provided a pseudonym that identified as male were included and posts made by female readers were only included for context.</p><p>Study 2 Reproductive Medical Experts from several countries were contacted via email, they would have had some experience with trials of male contraceptives. Potential participants were provide an information sheet and consent form. An opportunistic sample included the first 6 experts that agreed to participate. As the pool of participants is small enough to identify participants no further detail is given, however, all were from high income countries.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Qualitative Analysis</head><p>The online accounts and interviews were both analysed using Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) (see 10 ). This method has been used in previous research on men and family planning due to the sensitive nature of the topic resulting in the researcher looking for underlying meaning in text and talk. The following discourses are representative of the dominant themes that occurred in over half of the accounts for both studies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Results</head><p>From the analysis 3 discourses emerged. In study 1, 'Acceptable Among Men in Committed Relationships Only'. In study 2, 'A Broad Range of Male Contraceptive Options are Necessary' and 'NES/T Developed from Hormones in Female Contraception'.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Discourse 1-Acceptable Among Men in Committed</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Relationships Only</head><p>Overall, men constructed a discursive repertoire that they wanted more contraceptive options for men in uncommitted relationships, that the MCG was not for this group of men: 'Reduce' the word doesn't fill one </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Discourse 2-A Broad Range of Male Contraceptive Options are</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Necessary</head><p>Reproductive Medical Experts perceived that the MCG was one necessary option to provide men a broader range of choices: "Yeah , I think, yeah, what are the disadvantages of those particular types? Yeah, I mean, so condoms are great, but they're terrible, right? So and, you know, the failure rate is, luckily it's a little lower than it used to be, now its 13%. And, you know, in perfect use sure, but perfect use of condoms is really difficult. And particularly non-monogamous relationships, so, so super important, but not great. You know, vasectomy is just, I mean, it's, it's great if people have decided, but we know, you know, in the [Country] the reversal, you know, and, and vasectomy reversal is really for the upper class. So, that's not an option really, for most people. So, and there's cultural barriers to the sector as well. So, so I think, you know, there's nothing wrong with those also, those methods are great for the right person. But, you know, again, we're not providing a lot of options." Reproductive Medical Expert 4</p><p>In the extract Expert 4 discusses the limitations of condom and vasectomy. That perfect use of condoms is 'difficult' and still has a '13%' failure rate, while acknowledging that condoms are best for 'nonmonogamous relationships', emphasising this with 'so, so super important". Vasectomy is seen as 'great if people have decided' to stop having children as the reversal is expensive and for the 'upper class' or those with money. It is also acknowledged that there are cultural barriers to uptake. The discursive resource of "you know" is used to establish comradery with the interviewer, assuming that the interviewer agrees. This is a noticeable change from the 'I' statements made in the first two sentences, which is a discursive practice for authority. Overall, Reproductive Experts perceived that a MCG would give men more options to take primary responsibility, as 'we're not providing a lot of options' currently.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Discourse 3-NES/T Developed from Hormones in Female</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Contraception</head><p>It was explained by Reproductive Medical Experts that the hormones used in the MCG came from historic developments from female contraceptives: "Well, they've [researchers] been, you know, in different forms have been researching it [MCG] for a while, for example, [there is] a lot of data on testosterone, either injection or gel, being a contraceptive just like female birth control with, you know, estrogen and progesterone in it. That's been going on now, it's over 50 years of, of knowledge about that since they started that method for the women…And, but also, they found that not all men suppressed with just testosterone, especially Caucasians, if you're Asian, a different ethnicity or race and genetic issues associated with why some and different groups suppressed [sperm production] with one and some not. And so that's why they added nestorone, or a basically a progesterone derivative that the Population Council had, had come up with, and it's actually based on again, a product that's in female birth control already, and even the birth control ring that they have." Reproductive Medical Expert 3 Expert 3 describes the use of testosterone and the understanding of female contraceptives as the main components that allowed for the development of the MCG, emphasising there is 'a lot of data on testosterone' and that knowledge has been borrowed from 'over 50 years' of female contraceptives. The persistent use of 'they' in Expert 3's statements show the foundations for the MCG have been long discovered by researchers. However, knowledge of testosterone alone could not advance the development of the contraceptive gel, with Expert 3 drawing on a discursive resource of cultural barriers where the MCG did not supress sperm production the same among 'different ethnicity or race or genetic issues'. Expert 3 states that this issue was rectified with Nestorone 'based on again, a product that is in female birth control already', in particular the vaginal ring. The use of the words 'again' and 'already' informs that the knowledge readily established within the history and advancements of female contraceptives has been vital in the progression of the MCG trials.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p>The concept of male contraceptives being marketed to men in stable relationships has been seen consistently; Flood 24 (2003) concluded once a relationship becomes serious, condoms are often abandoned, and it therefore makes sense that couples seek other methods of contraception. Interview and focus group transcripts of the men and women who participated in one of the first World Health Organisation (WHO) clinical trials of an injectable male hormonal contraceptive also claimed there was only scope for this type of contraception in long-term relationships [ 25 ]. It is therefore suggested if NES/T becomes available, it would likely be targeted at men in stable relationships. This was also acknowledged by the Reproductive Medical Experts. The men's responses alluded to concerns over the side effects of the MCG's, they were concerned about fertility, sperm production, and long-term effects, but lacked the knowledge to make informed decisions.</p><p>These findings have been mirrored in previous literature. Side effects appear to be a concern among a range of male contraceptives, including the male pill [ 8 ]. Men from Bristol suggested they would not tolerate any side effects of male contraception [ 26 ]. Men unwilling to use male contraceptives were also most concerned about their fertility. In a qualitative study man willing to use male contraceptives presented an overall anxious discourse surrounding side effects [ 27 ], which is mirrored in the current research. However, it is interesting to note that the Experts stated there has been over 50 years of knowledge on testosterone and that Nestorone, in NES/T, has already been used safely in the vaginal ring.</p><p>There is also concern about unknown long-term effects, and Manetti and Honig 28 (2010) claim this is the reason there are currently no marketable products. Concern over side effects could also be linked to masculinity or virility and suggests that men may feel emasculated by having a lowered sperm count [ 29 , 8 ]. Oudshoorn 30 (2003) claims that clinical trials for male contraceptives aim for zero risk, rather than finding a balanced risk-benefit, as done previously with female contraceptives. She stresses that all drugs have side effects and side effects may be inevitable. Both men and women realise there is a need for marketable male contraceptive products, in order to make a realistic judgement [ 31 ]. Furthermore, researchers state that clinical trials have run their course, and the focus should now be on distribution [ 32 ]. They claim that research has been underway for decades and research now needs to be transferred into the real world, as there is interest from couples in novel male contraceptives [ 33 ].</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Limitations</head><p>The first limitation is that the research is qualitative and cannot be generalized to a larger population. Quantitative studies are required to better understand how men perceive the social acceptability of a MCG.</p><p>The second limitation is that in study 1 there is a possibility that some accounts provided incorrect details of their location or chose to use a pseudonym of the opposite sex with which they identify. Third, Reproductive Medical Experts could only spare 20 minutes of their time.</p><p>To maximize on the data quality targeted questions were developed, but in the future funding is necessary to allow for participants to be paid to increase interview length.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Conclusion</head><p>NES/T was socially constructed as acceptable for men in committed relationships, perceived by experts as providing more options for couples, and understood as developed from knowledge on female contraceptives. It is important that other methods are developed for men in uncommitted relationships, but that NES/T is still developed to provide men a range of contraceptive options similar to women. Furthermore, how side effects and development are portrayed in the media is important to social acceptability, those Experts doing media interviews should consider this.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>for 80 couples willing to test it', Mail Online (Daily Mail), (O'Brien, 2019), The article written by Tanner 20 (2017) described a trial for NES/T where 400 couples from countries including the UK, United States (US), Kenya, Chile, Italy and Sweden, exploring the transition of two separate gels to one combined gel as the more convenient option. Chalmers and Deputy 21 (2018) described an ongoing trial using 420 couples in various locations in the US, and stated should trials be successful the gel would be available in 10 years. O'Brien 22 (2019) described a trial recruiting 80 couples for two years, claiming sperm production can be stopped within four months of use and returns to normal six months after stopping the use of the gel.</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>with confidence. [Petersfield, UK;<ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Tanner, 2017]</ref>. Uncommitted men believed that a reduced sperm count meant pregnancy was possible, suggesting they may not be knowledgeable about fertility. The majority of uncommitted men also constructed the side effects of the gel outweighed the benefits; If you end up with the arms of an orangutan and a face like the surface of the moon I think the treatment will be 100% successful. [Essex, UK; O'Brien, 2019]. In this extract the reader uses the discursive resource of 'arms of an orangutan" to represent the muscle gain and 'face like the surface of the moon' to represent acne, both side effects mentioned in the news article. Moreover, they were also concerned about the MCG's effect on the environment: So what effect do all these gels, creams and pills have on the environment when they eventually get washed off, or passed through the body and end up in the sea. [Teesside, United Kingdom; Chalmers &amp; Deputy, 2018]. With concern for the 'sea' if the gel is washed off, showing a desire for male contraceptives to be environmentally friendly. However, those men who were in committed relationships accepted the MCG as a welcome option. 'Fair enough. It makes more sense to take the bullets out of the gun than to wear a bulletproof vest' [Middletown, UK; O'Brien, 2019]. The discursive resource of a gun is used to represent how committed men constructed risk reduction from the MCG. Noting the use of a gun to represent the penis, suggesting there was masculine capital for taking contraceptive responsibility. And they used humour as a discursive resource to show their acceptance; It's probably the act of rubbing in the lotion, with the inevitable end result that reduces the count [Sud Seax, UK; Tanner, 2017]. All articles had similar humour about where the gel is rubbed, implying if it is rubbed on the penis that the man will ejaculate and his sperm count will lower. Despite their acceptability of the MCG, they predominantly believed that a vasectomy was more effective; The snip is a lot more effective [Leigh, UK; Chalmers &amp; Deputy, 2018]. Suggesting they are not knowledgeable about MCG efficacy.</figDesc></figure>
