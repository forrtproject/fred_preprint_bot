<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Few metrics of area-level socioeconomic deprivation exist that are comparable over time and space. This study aimed to create a consistent historic time-series area-level deprivation metric for 1981, 1986 and 1991 in Aotearoa New Zealand (hereafter,  New Zealand)  using census data at census area unit (CAU) level. Consistent variables, geography and statistical methods were employed over time. The metric revealed a gradual worsening of area-level deprivation in NZ from 1981 to 1991. We provide a historical perspective on New Zealand's socioeconomic conditions during the 1980s and early 1990s, which provides a platform for longitudinal studies in New Zealand to account for historical area-level deprivation.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>hile the concept of deprivation lacks a clear-cut definition <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Carstairs &amp; Morris, 1989)</ref>, it is widely accepted that deprivation generally denotes a state of disadvantage in comparison with the surrounding community or the larger society or nation to which an individual, family, or group belongs <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Townsend, 1987)</ref>. In the literature, this state of disadvantage is also known as neighbourhood socioeconomic status <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Murakami et al., 2009)</ref> or social inequality <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Barbek et al., 2022)</ref>. Several metrics have been devised to quantify deprivation at the level of small geographic areas. Some of the earliest examples from the UK include the Townsend Deprivation Index <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Townsend, 1987)</ref>, the Carstairs Index <ref type="bibr">(Carstairs &amp; Morris, 1990)</ref>, and the Jarman Index <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Jarman, 1991)</ref>. The Townsend Deprivation Index has served as the basis for several subsequent area-level deprivation metrics <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Exeter et al., 2017)</ref>. It measures material deprivation based on four indicators: unemployment, non-home ownership, overcrowding and non-car ownership <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Townsend, 1987)</ref>. However, more contemporary area-level deprivation metrics, such as the Index of Relative Socio-economic Disadvantage from Australia <ref type="bibr">(Australian Bureau Of Statistics, 2021)</ref> and the Area Deprivation Index from the United States <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Kind &amp; Buckingham, 2018)</ref>, have expanded the scope of deprivation beyond material factors to measures of wellbeing, such as education. Furthermore, other area-level metrics have taken a more comprehensive approach, incorporating environmental factors like accessibility to services (e.g., medical facilities) and information on the environment (e.g., crime rates, air quality, flood risk, green space) <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Allik et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Exeter et al., 2017)</ref>. Overall, many metrics have been devised that summarise socioeconomic disadvantage; however, they often provide only a snapshot of the conditions at a specific point in time. W Area-level deprivation metrics have been used extensively in the social and health sciences for research and policy development. By providing information on socioeconomic disadvantage and inequalities over space, and sometimes time, these metrics have become crucial tools for the creation of evidence-based policy <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Norman, 2010</ref><ref type="bibr">(Norman, , 2016;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Pratschke &amp; Haase, 2015)</ref>. For example, using area-level deprivation as a weighting factor in funding allocation makes it possible to ensure that resources such as funding for schools and health organisations are directed towards areas of high need <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Exeter et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Salmond &amp; Crampton, 2012)</ref>. In addition, these metrics are highly valued in research in social and public health as they can be used as both a variable of interest and a confounding variable <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Salmond &amp; Crampton, 2012)</ref>, helping researchers gain insights into the underlying causes or potential outcomes of the inequalities in area-level deprivation <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Pampalon et al., 2012)</ref>. For instance, previous research has found that area-level deprivation is associated with health outcomes including obesity <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Adams et al., 2009)</ref>, mental health conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Cairns et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Skapinakis et al., 2005)</ref>, reduced life expectancy <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Tobias &amp; Cheung, 2003)</ref>, and lower health-related quality of life <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Adams et al., 2009)</ref>. Overall, knowledge of arealevel deprivation can inform the development of policies and research aimed at reducing these inequalities and improving the overall wellbeing of communities.</p><p>Aotearoa New Zealand (hereafter, New Zealand) has two widely used deprivation metrics: the New Zealand Deprivation Index (NZDep) <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Atkinson et al., 2019)</ref> and more recently, the New Zealand Index of Multiple Deprivation (NZIMD) <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Exeter et al., 2017)</ref>. The NZDep used census data that was collected every five years from 1991 to 2018. The NZDep 1991 encompassed seven domains of deprivation: income, transport, living space, home ownership, employment, qualifications and social support <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Crampton et al., 1998)</ref>. Changes in domains have occurred in different versions of the NZDep, such as the addition of 'access to telephone' in the NZDep 1996 <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Salmond et al., 1998)</ref> and the removal of the 'transport' domain in the latest NZDep 2018 <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Atkinson et al., 2019)</ref>. The NZDep used meshblock as the smallest geographic until the 2018 Census, when the NZDep was presented at both Statistical Area 1 (SA1) and meshblock levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Atkinson et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Crampton et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Salmond &amp; Crampton, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Salmond et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Salmond et al., 1998)</ref>. A meshblock contains around 90 people per area <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Crampton et al., 1998)</ref>, while a SA1 contained 100-200 residents per area in 2018 <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Atkinson et al., 2019)</ref>. In contrast, the NZIMD draws on multiple data sources, including not only census data but also data from administrative sources such as the Ministry of Health, Stats NZ and the Ministry of Social Development <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Exeter et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Exeter et al., 2017)</ref>. The NZIMD measures seven domains of deprivation: employment, income, crime, housing, health, education and geographical accessibility of facilities. The NZIMD was developed in 2013 and again in 2018, with slight modifications to the variables within each domain to better reflect social advancement. It utilises data zones as the geographic boundary, with an average population of 712 in 2013 and 761 in 2018. An advantage of the NZIMD is its flexibility, allowing the use of individual domains, or combinations thereof, for different scenarios.</p><p>Although the NZIMD and NZDep have been used in many studies in New Zealand, inconsistencies across different versions of these indices have hindered their use in longitudinal studies that require consistent measures of deprivation over time. This is because the forms of the questions and the geographic boundaries across censuses may vary through time, making a deprivation score calculated for one area in one census not directly comparable with a score from another census year <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Norman, 2010)</ref>. Furthermore, the statistical methods and weights employed for constructing these area-level deprivation metrics may also change. To enable the use of area-level deprivation metrics in longitudinal studies, an area-level deprivation metric with consistent geographical boundary data, definition of variables, and statistical methods of construction must be established <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Salmond &amp; Crampton, 2012)</ref>. In a systematic review conducted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Jivraj et al. (2020)</ref>, which examined 53 studies on life course exposure to neighbourhood deprivation and its impact on health and wellbeing, only 6 per cent of the studies measured the neighbourhood deprivation retrospectively, using historical census data linked to individuals' residential life history. In addition, only 30 per cent of studies explicitly mentioned the use of consistent geographic boundaries over time by redistributing neighbourhood deprivation data from earlier and later time points <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Jivraj et al., 2020)</ref>. In short, these inconsistencies in the measures of arealevel deprivation employed in existing longitudinal studies have complicated the establishment of causality between area-level deprivation and health or wellbeing.</p><p>In New Zealand, the development of an area-level deprivation metric with historical and time-series data is useful for several reasons. First, it can provide insights into how arealevel deprivation has evolved over both time and space. By understanding these patterns, policymakers and researchers can identify areas that require more attention and resources to address systemic issues related to deprivation and inequality <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Diaz et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Singh, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Tobias &amp; Cheung, 2003)</ref>. Second, by analysing data over an extended period, researchers can identify factors that have contributed to the current state of deprivation in certain areas, such as socioeconomic policies and historical events <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Exeter et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Fu et al., 2015)</ref>. And finally, the availability of a longitudinal area-level deprivation metric can enable New Zealand-based longitudinal research in social and public health areas to link past exposure to area-level deprivation to long-term health and behaviour outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Baranyi et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Jivraj et al., 2020)</ref>. Research has demonstrated the noteworthy influence of area-level deprivation on outcomes after isolating the influence of individual-level or family-level deprivation, such as all-cause mortality <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Ribeiro et al., 2022)</ref> and self-harm and violent criminality <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Ejlskov et al., 2023)</ref>, highlighting the importance of incorporating area-level deprivation measures in social and health research in addition to traditional individual-level or family-level deprivation. To address the historical gap before 1991 regarding area-level socioeconomic conditions in New Zealand, this study aimed to create a time-series area-level deprivation metric for New <ref type="bibr">Zealand in 1981</ref><ref type="bibr">Zealand in , 1986</ref><ref type="bibr">Zealand in and 1991</ref>. Unlike existing indices that measure relative socioeconomic deprivation, this study focused on measuring absolute changes in socioeconomic deprivation, specifically through the proportions of unemployment and nonhome ownership. The study also visualised the time-series arealevel deprivation metric and compared the changes in area-level deprivation over time and space.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>An overview</head><p>The workflow of constructing the area-level deprivation metric in this study is illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. Bespoke census data on the Work and Labour Force Status (WLFS) of individuals and tenure status of dwellings by census area unit (CAU) and corresponding geographic boundaries in 1981, 1986 and 1991 were requested from Stats NZ. The 1981 census year was the earliest time-point that census data with valid geographic boundaries were available. The data sources and processing steps involved in handling the raw census and geography data are described in the subsection 'Geography data'. Following the linkage of census data to their respective geography data, the data from 1981 and 1986 were aligned with the geographic boundaries used in 1991. The conversion of data between different geographic boundaries is detailed in the subsection 'Converting data between geographic boundaries'. After conversion, the percentages of unemployment and non-home ownership were calculated and then normalised using a median absolute deviation (MAD) transformation across the different census years. The resulting area-level deprivation scores were then divided into quintiles. The specific details of each step are outlined in the subsection 'Calculating and constructing the area-level deprivation metric'. on the employment status of individuals aged 15 years and over on the census night. While the categorisations of WLFS vary across the three censuses, the data for 1981 and 1986 were counted using the 1991 definition of WLFS to ensure comparability between different census years. Relevant evidence on how the WLFS questions were asked in the three censuses can be found in the supplementary notes. 1 In this study, our data for the WLFS status are divided into four categories: 1) full-time employed, 2) part-time employed, 3) unemployed, and 4) not in the labour force. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> illustrates the criteria used to classify individuals into these categories of WLFS in the 1991 Census. The 'unemployed' and 'not in the labour force' categories were used in the subsequent calculation of the unemployment percentage (as the unemployment percentage is defined as the proportion of unemployed individuals in the economically active population). Specifically, unemployed people are defined as individuals who meet all the following criteria: 1) they are 15 years of age or older, 2) they are not currently employed in a paid job, and 3) they have either been actively seeking employment within the past four weeks or have secured a new job to start within the next four weeks. Individuals who are not in the labour force apply to two categories: 1) those who are not currently employed in a paid job and are also not available for work, and 2) those who are not currently employed in a paid job, are available for work, but have not actively sought employment within the past four weeks or do not have a new job to start within the next four weeks. The dwelling tenure data provide information on the occupancy status of private dwellings on the census night. The categorisations of occupancy status again varied across the three censuses. Relevant evidence on how the occupancy status of private dwellings was obtained in the three censuses can be found in the supplementary notes. There were six categories of dwelling tenure in the 1981 Census: 1) owned with a mortgage, 2) owned without a mortgage, 3) rented or leased but not from the employer of the tenant, 4) rented or leased from the employer of the tenant, 5) provided free but not with a job, and 6) provided free with a job. Of these categories, categories 3 and 4 were considered private dwellings that are not owned by the occupants. In the 1986 and 1991 censuses, the six categories from the previous census were simplified into four: 1) owned with a mortgage, 2) owned without a mortgage, 3) rented or leased, and 4) provided free. Of these categories, category 3 was considered private dwellings that are not owned by the occupants. In addition, the dwelling tenure data also include an "unspecified column indicating the number of private dwellings with unknown occupancy status".</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Geography data</head><p>Geographic boundaries in this deprivation metric are defined on the CAU level, which was the second smallest statistical area in New Zealand Standard Areas Classification 1992 <ref type="bibr">(Department of Statistics New Zealand, 1992)</ref>. The smallest statistical area is meshblock <ref type="bibr">(Department of Statistics New Zealand, 1992)</ref>. CAUs are created by aggregating adjacent meshblocks that share contiguous boundaries, making them intermediate in size between meshblocks and territorial authorities <ref type="bibr">(Department of Statistics New Zealand, 1992)</ref>. The size of CAUs can vary depending on whether they are in urban or rural areas and over time as areas change in their population structure and urban form, but CAUs are typically collections of city blocks in urban areas and similar in size to localities or communities in rural areas <ref type="bibr">(Department of Statistics New Zealand, 1992)</ref>. Each CAU has a unique name and identifier and is a distinct geographic entity <ref type="bibr">(Department of Statistics New Zealand, 1992)</ref>. CAUs were chosen in this metric instead of meshblocks because data from the 1981, 1986 and 1991 censuses were only available at the CAU level. However, CAUs are still capable of capturing differences within communities and cities, making them a suitable alternative to meshblocks. The median number of individuals aged 15 years old and over within a CAU was 1161.0 in 1981, 1314.0 in 1986, and 1308.0 in 1991. The median number of private dwellings within a CAU was 501.0 in 1981, 589.5 in 1986, and 591.0 in 1991. Detailed distribution data for counts of individuals aged 15 years and over and private dwellings within CAUs for these three years can be found in the supplementary notes (Figure <ref type="figure">S7</ref>). In this study, CAUs that are oceanic, water inlets, lakes or harbour ports were excluded from analysis (n = 97 for 1981, n = 81 for 1986, and n = 109 for 1991). Due to the lack of information about land classification at the CAU level, this process had to be done manually. To identify these CAUs, keywords such as 'inlet', 'inland water', 'harbour', and 'oceanic' in the names of the CAUs were selected and manually checked against satellite images to confirm their location in water areas. CAUs that included mostly land but had a small portion of water were still included in the analysis. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> shows the number of CAUs that were excluded. Approximately 5 per cent of CAUs in all three censuses were in water areas and were excluded from the analysis. After cleaning, the census data were linked to the corresponding geographic boundaries using CAU identifiers.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Norman, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Norman et al., 2003)</ref>. Failure to do so may result in ambiguity, making it challenging to discern whether changes in the deprivation metric are due to actual changes in the socioeconomic conditions or simply due to alterations in the geographic boundaries <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Norman, 2010)</ref>.</p><p>To establish a time-series area-level deprivation metric, data from the 1981 Census (2001 geographic boundaries) and 1986 Census (1996 geographic boundaries) were converted to the geographic boundaries of the data from the 1991 Census (2006 geographic boundaries). <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Norman (2010)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Norman et al. (2008)</ref> describe a method of converting census data between different geographic boundaries. The method involves constructing intersection zones between the source geography and the target geography by overlaying the two geographic boundaries, as illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>. The raw census data in the source geography could then be apportioned to the intersection zones using population weights based on the population where the intersection zones and the source geographic boundaries overlap. Finally, the data in the intersection zones can be aggregated to the target geography. The highlight of this approach is that it recognises that population distribution is uneven across space and uses population weights to account for this variability <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Norman, 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Building upon Norman's approach, this study applied the following steps to convert the data from the 1981 and 1986 censuses to the geographic boundaries for the 1991 Census:</p><p>1. Identify the intersection zones between the 1981 and 1991 geographic boundaries and between the 1986 and 1991 geographic boundaries.</p><p>2. Calculate the population in the intersection zones and their source geographies.</p><p>3. Construct the conversion table by dividing the population in the intersection zones by the population in their source geographic boundary.</p><p>4. Apportion raw census data from the source geography to the intersection zones.</p><p>5. Aggregate the census data across the target geographic boundary.</p><p>This study utilised residential buildings around 1985 as a proxy of population distribution in <ref type="bibr">1981, 1986 and 1991</ref>. This decision was based on two assumptions: 1) that an equal number of people lived in each building, and 2) that the distribution of residential buildings in 1985 was the same as that in 1981, 1986 and 1991. While we acknowledge the variability in building numbers over time, we maintain that this assumption is grounded in a reasonable estimation given the relatively stable population trends during the specified period <ref type="bibr">(Statistics New Zealand, 2014)</ref>. The methods of developing the proxy measure for population distribution around 1985 can be found in the supplementary notes. (2 )</p><p>All private dwellings -provided free -not specified Due to the skewed distribution of the resulting percentages of unemployment and non-home ownership, they were normalised using a median absolute deviation (MAD) transformation, described in Equation (3) and Equation (4). The normalisation process involved stacking the data from the three censuses into a single file, allowing each variable to be expressed relative to the three-year coverage. Area-level deprivation scores were calculated by adding up the two normalised percentages with equal weights. To enhance the convenience of usage and visualisation, the area-level deprivation scores were further divided into populationweighted quintiles.</p><p>(3) where:</p><p>Xi denotes a single data value denotes the median of the data set, and mad(X) is determined from Equation (4).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Validation for the area-level deprivation metric</head><p>To validate and justify the appropriateness of utilising unemployment and non-home ownership as indicators for arealevel deprivation, an analysis was conducted using the Townsend Deprivation Index for the UK in 2001 and 2002. From this index, a separate metric was generated by combining standardised unemployment and non-home ownership percentages, assigning equal weights to each variable. Subsequently, the correlation between this generated metric, which solely considers these two variables and the original Townsend deprivation score, was calculated for both years.</p><p>To further investigate the suitability of utilising unemployment and non-home ownership as indicators of arealevel deprivation in New Zealand, a second correlation test was performed between the deprivation score derived from this study and the NZDep 1991 deprivation score at the CAU level. It is worth noting that in this analysis, we used the original deprivation scores from the 1991 NZDep rather than the deciles that are more commonly used in various applications. However, there was a discrepancy in the boundaries used: the deprivation metric derived in this study in 1991 was based on the 2006 CAU boundary, while the NZDep 1991 deprivation score was based on the 1991 CAU boundary. To address this issue, the 2006 CAU boundaries were converted into centroids, and their corresponding deprivation scores were retained. These centroids were then joined to the 1991 CAU boundaries by their spatial relationship. In cases where multiple centroids from the 2006 CAU fell within one 1991 CAU, various statistical measures such as the minimum, maximum, mean and median values of the deprivation scores were calculated. Subsequently, the correlation test was conducted using these statistical measures (minimum, maximum, mean and median values) of the deprivation scores derived in this study and the NZDep 1991 deprivation scores. A correlation test was conducted for the CAUs where deprivation scores exist in both metrics (n = 1596). A Pearson's product-moment correlation coefficient was employed to quantify the strength of the correlations for both tests.  Figures 5a-5c visualise the time-series area-level deprivation across the 1981, 1986 and 1991 census years. In 1981, the most deprived areas (darker colours) were concentrated in the far north, central and eastern areas of the North Island, as well as in some areas of the West Coast of the South Island. The city centres of Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch exhibited higher levels of deprivation compared with their fringe areas. Notably, the southeastern Auckland region displayed a high area-level deprivation status. By 1986, the far north, central and eastern areas of the North Island and some areas on the West Coast of the South Island remained the most deprived areas, with the North Island appearing more deprived overall than the South Island. In addition, the arealevel deprivation level was low in the southernmost part of the South Island. In metropolitan areas, the most deprived areas still clustered in the city centres, while more areas on the fringes showed an increase in area-level deprivation. Moving to 1991, the national area-level deprivation patterns remained largely similar to those observed in 1986. However, a notable increase was observed in some CAUs in Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch, experiencing higher levels of deprivation compared to 1986. Maps of the area-level deprivation metric for other cities in New Zealand are provided in the supplementary notes (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">S10-S14</ref>). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">S10-S14</ref>, two general patterns emerge: 1) the city centres exhibit higher levels of deprivation compared with their fringe areas, and 2) these characteristics remained consistent over the decade from 1981 to 1991.  Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> compares the counts of CAUs that changed in area-level deprivation in each pair of the two time periods. From 1981 to 1986, 52.9 per cent of the areas remained unchanged in terms of area-level deprivation, 42.0 per cent of the areas in 1986 exhibited increased deprivation compared with 1981, and only 5.0 per cent of the areas in 1986 had lower deprivation levels than in 1981. From 1986 to 1991, 41.0 per cent of the areas remained unchanged in terms of area-level deprivation, 53.1 per cent of the areas in 1991 exhibited increased deprivation compared with 1986, and only 5.9 per cent of the areas in 1991 had lower deprivation levels than in 1986. During the decade from 1981 to 1991, 69.9 per cent of areas in 1991 exhibited increased deprivation compared with 1981, only 27.2 per cent of areas had no changes in their deprivation scores, and only 2.9 per cent of the areas (50 CAUs) in 1991 had lower deprivation levels than in 1981. Visualisations of these changes at a national level, as well as in Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S15a-c</ref>), and other cities (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">S16 -S20</ref>), are available in the supplementary notes. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Regional-level analysis of the area-level deprivation metric</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">6</ref> presents the distribution of deprivation quintiles over time by administrative regions. The results demonstrate a consistent pattern of increasing area-level deprivation from 1981 to 1991 across all administrative regions. Specifically, the level of deprivation in 1986 was higher than that in 1981, and the level of deprivation in 1991 was higher than that in 1986. This gradient in area-level deprivation was observed in all regions. Some regions, including Auckland, Hawke's Bay, Whanganui, Northland, Southland and the West Coast, have witnessed a larger variance in terms of deprivation levels in 1991, aligning with the national trend.</p><p>The proportions of CAUs that experienced changes of varying extent in area-level deprivation quintiles within each administrative region are presented in the supplementary notes for the periods from 1981 to 1986 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S21</ref>), from 1986 to 1991 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S22</ref>), and from 1981 to 1991 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S23</ref>). From 1981 to 1986, Auckland and Marlborough stand out as the regions with the smallest and the largest proportions of CAUs, respectively, that became more deprived over this five-year period. On the other hand, Northland is the region that exhibited the largest proportion of CAUs experiencing an improvement in area-level deprivation. From 1986 to 1991, the Marlborough and Nelson regions had exhibited the smallest and largest proportions of CAUs, respectively, that experienced increased deprivation over this five-year period. However, it is worth noting that all regions observed improvements in area-level deprivation in certain CAUs. Overall, from 1981 to 1991, over the decade, a substantial percentage of CAUs experienced an increase in deprivation, ranging from approximately 50 per cent in Tasman to more than 80 per cent in Gisborne. On the other hand, Nelson had the largest percentage of CAUs that became less deprived, accounting for about 8 per cent. Notably, five regions -Southland, Bay of Plenty, Taranaki, Hawke's Bay and Gisborne -did not have any CAUs that experienced a decrease in deprivation, indicating consistent or worsening deprivation levels across all CAUs within these regions in this decade. Validation for the area-level deprivation metric</p><p>The correlation coefficient between the area-level deprivation metric, obtained by summing only two variables (unemployment and nonhome ownership) from the UK-based Townsend Deprivation Index, and the original Townsend deprivation score was found to be 0.96 in 2001 and 0.95 in 2011 (p &lt; 0.0001). This suggests that the variables of unemployment and non-home ownership are sufficient to explain most of the variance in the UK-based Townsend Deprivation Index.</p><p>A second correlation test, which also used Pearson's productmoment corelation coefficient to quantify corelation, was performed between the area-level deprivation scores in 1991 derived from this study and the NZDep 1991 deprivation scores derived from <ref type="bibr">Crampton et al. (1997)</ref>. The analysis revealed positive correlations, with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.804 (using the minimum deprivation score) to 0.814 (using the mean deprivation score) (p &lt; 0.001). These results demonstrate that the deprivation metric in 1991 constructed in this study is correlated with NZDep 1991, thereby suggesting again that our measure is a possible proxy for average CAU-level deprivation in New Zealand.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>This study aimed to construct a consistent time-series area-level deprivation metric in <ref type="bibr">1981, 1986 and 1991</ref> in New Zealand at the CAU level. Findings from our study revealed a consistent increase in area-level deprivation across the country during the studied decade, surpassing the available data from 1991. Certain areas, namely the far north, central and eastern areas of the North Island, along with the west coast of the South Island, consistently remained the most deprived areas throughout the period. All administrative regions experienced an increase in area-level deprivation over the decade from 1981 to 1991 but with varying magnitudes of change. Furthermore, most metropolitan areas consistently exhibited higher levels of deprivation in their city centres compared with their fringe areas. Importantly, we demonstrated that the choice of indicators in our area-level deprivation metric is reasonable, and our measure of area-level deprivation was correlated with the NZDep 1991 area-level deprivation scores.</p><p>This study demonstrates an increase in area-level deprivation in New Zealand between 1981 and 1991. This period coincided with extensive neoliberal social and economic reforms implemented in New Zealand, starting in the mid-1980s <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Baxendine et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Dalziel, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Denemark, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Pearce &amp; Dorling, 2006)</ref>. These reforms involved various measures, such as the freeing of interest rates from regulations, elimination of restrictions on international capital, allowing the currency to float in foreign exchange markets, and gradually reducing agricultural subsidies and tax incentives <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Dalziel, 2002)</ref>. Some people considered these reform measures were generally successful as they transformed the economy from one of the most interventionist among the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries to one of the most market-based <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Conway &amp; Orr, 2000)</ref>. However, critics argued that these policies were accompanied by a significant increase in unemployment <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Baxendine et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Dalziel, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Denemark, 1999)</ref>. Specifically, during the 1986 to 1991 period, the nation experienced a decline of 9.7 per cent in total full-time employment and 7.6 per cent in total headcount employment <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Baxendine et al., 2005)</ref>. Our study aligns with these concerns, as it observed a similar pattern of increased unemployment rates during the 1986 to 1991 period which were not evenly distributed across the country. Furthermore, consistent with our study's finding that area-level deprivation increased across all administrative regions from 1981 to 1991, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Baxendine et al. (2005)</ref> conducted a spatial analysis of labour markets from 1986 to 2001 and also observed that all administrative regions experienced a decline in full-time employment during the 1986-1991 period in New Zealand. It is worth noting that while the reforms also involved housing policies, those changes related to housing policies were implemented after the census night in March 1991 <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Campbell, 1999)</ref>. This may explain why no dramatic changes in home ownership percentages were observed within the time frame studied.</p><p>It is important to acknowledge that while our metric shows a consistently higher level of deprivation in city centres compared with their fringe areas over time, this disparity may not necessarily reflect genuine deprivation. We cannot ignore the fact that nonhomeownership constitutes a half of the metric. In city centres, there might be a concentration of more transient populations (e.g., university students) <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Marek et al., 2023)</ref> who often prefer renting over homeownership due to the flexibility renting affords, and their presence in the city centre may skew the measurement of deprivation in these areas.</p><p>Having access to this historical time-series area-level deprivation metric opens up new possibilities for future studies in New Zealand to gain a better understanding of how significant socioeconomic transformations impact individual health and how neighbourhood deprivation affects health outcomes over time. A study in the UK sheds light on this matter, indicating that individuals residing in economically disadvantaged neighbourhoods at the onset of the 2008 "great recession" experienced a significantly higher risk of declining mental health <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Curtis et al., 2021)</ref>. Furthermore, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Boyle et al. (2023)</ref> conducted a study that modelled historical neighbourhood deprivation, providing evidence of historical neighbourhood deprivation as a risk factor for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Additionally, area-level deprivation may interact with individual-level socioeconomic disadvantage to influence health outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Baranyi et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Baumer et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Hong et al., 2023)</ref>.</p><p>These new data within our area-level deprivation metric from 1981 to 1991 have important implications. First, the data offer valuable insights into the socioeconomic disadvantages and inequalities at the CAU level since 1981. The data, therefore, enables the identification of small areas that have been persistently deprived since 1981, such as the far north. This information is helpful for understanding and addressing long-standing socioeconomic disparities within New Zealand <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Hobbs et al., 2019)</ref>. The information is also useful when allocating resources to areas that have been historically disadvantaged or marginalised <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Exeter et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Salmond &amp; Crampton, 2012)</ref>. Additionally, the availability of this historical area-level deprivation metric enables the evaluation of past policies (e.g., the social and economic reforms in 1984) <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Conway &amp; Orr, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Dalziel, 2002)</ref> and interventions aimed at addressing area-level deprivation-related issues and minimising socioeconomic inequalities.</p><p>This study has several key strengths that make significant contributions to the field of area-level deprivation research in New Zealand. First, the metric developed in this study makes it possible to examine area-level deprivation before 1991, allowing for an analysis of the evolution of area-level deprivation from as early as 1981. Before the development of this metric, there was no way to examine area-level deprivation consistently before 1991 in New Zealand. Secondly, the study uses consistent variables, statistical methods and geographic units to construct the area-level deprivation metric, making it possible to compare deprivation data over time <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Salmond &amp; Crampton, 2012)</ref>. This is particularly important for longitudinal studies, as it allows for analysis of changes in deprivation over time <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Norman, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Norman et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Salmond &amp; Crampton, 2012)</ref>. Thirdly, while census-based area-level deprivation metrics possess inherent limitations concerning timeliness <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Exeter et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Ward et al., 2019)</ref> and the use of proxy measures of area-level deprivation <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Exeter et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Norman, 2010)</ref>, metrics utilising census data provide superior comparability across countries and over time <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Allik et al., 2016)</ref>. This is because census questions remain relatively constant across different countries and over time, making them popular in larger comparative studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Allik et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Exeter et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Marí-Dell'Olmo et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Norman et al., 2011)</ref>.</p><p>While this study represents a significant advancement in understanding historically relevant area-level deprivation, it is important to acknowledge its limitations. First, the selection of indicators in constructing this area-level deprivation metric was constrained by data availability rather than being driven solely by the phenomenon of interest. While it has been validated that the variables of unemployment and non-home ownership can capture much of the data required for this study, it is important to note that this metric may only capture limited aspects of area-level deprivation. Socioeconomic deprivation is a multi-faceted construct that is hard to measure, hence the common use of composite measures that have several variables. It would be expected that this index, being reliant on only two variables neither of which are income or education, would not reproduce the consistently strong relationships that are normally seen across a wide range of health and social outcomes. Attempts were made to incorporate variables into this metric including non-car ownership and overcrowding, but due to issues such as many missing values and low response rates, ultimately these variables were not utilised in the metric. Likewise, other variables such as education attainment and household income, which are commonly incorporated into deprivation measures, were not included due to historical data availability. Secondly, while significant efforts were made to process the data into a cohesive structure, some uncertainties in the data remain. Thirdly, the nature of census data may introduce potential biases in terms of varying response rates across different areas. Potentially, more-deprived areas produce lower response rates, which could result in an underestimation of unemployment or non-home ownership rates <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Goodman &amp; Gatward, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Turrell et al., 2003)</ref>. Fourthly, the census data were converted between different geographic boundaries based on residential buildings in 1985 as a proxy of population distribution; relying solely on this proxy may produce inaccurate results as this measure can only provide an approximate representation of population distribution. Also, this metric focuses on the changes between 1981 and 1991, but the method of constructing this metric is not easy to be generalised to produce a similar one for recent years due to the complexity of the geographical conversion methods. Lastly, it is important to acknowledge that the Modifiable Areal Unit Problem (MAUP) is inherent to this study. The selection of geographic boundaries was constrained by data availability, and using alternative boundaries such as suburbs or administrative areas may yield different results <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Cebrecos et al., 2018)</ref>. The employment of CAUs as the geographic unit in this metric can potentially mask many pockets of deprivation because CAUs are on a larger scale than the finer meshblock or data zone units employed by other commonly used deprivation indices in New Zealand. However, the prospect for further improvement exists if historical census data can be restored and made accessible at the meshblock level in the near future. This would enable the use of customised geographic units, thus mitigating the risk of the MAUP.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>The historically relevant time-series area-level deprivation metric extends the understanding of area-level deprivation across the 1980s, as previous data on area-level deprivation in New Zealand were only available starting from 1991. The resulting metric not only contributes to the understanding of spatial area-level deprivation dynamics in New Zealand since 1981 but also offers valuable data for investigating the long-term impacts of area-level deprivation on various societal and public health outcomes. This metric holds importance by providing insights into persistent area-level deprivation over time, which may help with directing resources towards underserved and marginalised areas, evaluating past policies, and informing future planning.</p></div>
