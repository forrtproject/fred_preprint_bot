<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Can autocratic indoctrination shape contemporary democratic preferences? We argue that while ideological indoctrination can influence democratic preferences after a regime transition, its effects are significantly conditioned by the cognitive dissonance between individuals' lived experiences under autocracy and the indoctrinating propaganda. Using a Regression Discontinuity Design and survey data from the Baltic countries, we estimate the causal impact of exposure to Soviet indoctrination through compulsory elementary education in the aftermath of the Soviet occupation in 1944. Our results show that exposure to Soviet elementary education reduces democratic preferences and increases support for authoritarianism after democratic transitions. Most importantly, our findings also demonstrate that benefiting from the Soviet regime conditions the effect of educational indoctrination on support for democracy.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Under what conditions can autocratic regimes effectively indoctrinate their populations?</p><p>Extensive scholarship has explored the role of indoctrination as a mechanism for regime stability, emphasizing its function in legitimizing autocratic rule. However, the impact of indoctrination may extend well beyond the lifespan of the regime itself, manifesting in forms of 'nostalgia' for the autocratic past even in seemingly consolidated democracies (Alesina and Fuchs-Schündeln 2007; Neundorf and Pop-Eleches 2020). If indoctrination can indeed persist after democratization, it carries profound implications for democratic resilience, as it can potentially undermine support for democratic norms and institutions, and even fuel the resurgence of extremist movements that evoke the former dictatorship <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Darden and Grzymala-Busse 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Neundorf 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Voigtländer and Voth 2015)</ref>. This study examines the conditions under which indoctrination successfully shapes political attitudes over the long term, raising critical questions about the durability of democratic consolidation and, more importantly, the persistence of support for authoritarianism even after democratic transitions.</p><p>Recent studies have increasingly examined how the legacies of past dictatorships shape contemporary political preferences (Dinas and Northmore-Ball 2020; Pop-Eleches and Tucker 2013). Despite being recognized as a core mechanism of authoritarian control, the conditions that determine the effectiveness of indoctrination remain significantly understudied (Neundorf and Pop-Eleches 2020;</p><p>Darden and</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Grzymala-Busse 2006).</head><p>While evidence suggests that indoctrination can shape democratic attitudes even after transitions to democracy, we argue in this article that its impact is unlikely to be uniform across individuals, even when they are exposed to indoctrination during the same formative ages. We propose a conditional framework for understanding the effect of authoritarian indoctrination on post-transitional support for democracy.</p><p>We make two key arguments. First, building on existing literature, we assert that indoctrination is most effective when experienced as part of basic socialization, particularly through early education (Darden and Grzymala-Busse 2006; Alesina,</p><p>To further explore the formation of these preferences, we examine how individuals' lived experiences under the Soviet regime influence the enduring effects of indoctrination over time. We conduct a detailed analysis of two sub-samples of respondents, stratified by whether or not they followed career paths associated with receiving regime benefits. Each sub-sample includes a control and a treatment group, defined by their exposure to Soviet indoctrination. Because subjective perceptions regarding whether respondents benefited from the Soviet regime would create endogeneity problems in our analysis, we focus on the pre-treatment decision to attend -or not attend -technical schools (Tekhnikums). Students enroll in these specialized technical secondary schools after compulsory education, but the decision to attend is made prior to this point. Tekhnikums played a crucial role in supplying the technical labor force necessary for Soviet post-war industrial expansion, as they were established and operated by individual sector ministries, which recruited employees for state-run production directly from their graduates <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Peters 1956</ref>). These technical school graduates constituted the vanguard of the Soviet regime, occupying a practically useful, economically rewarded, and symbolically elevated social position within the Soviet system. We argue that this is a valid operationalization of benefiting from the Soviet regime, and we provide empirical evidence to support this claim.</p><p>This article makes two primary contributions to the literature on autocratic legacies and democratization. First, it challenges the conventional assumption that the effects of indoctrination are uniform, even when imposed on a mass scale through elementary education. By examining its impact on post-transitional politics, this study reveals that the efficacy of indoctrination is contingent on individuals' lived experiences under the regime. It is most effective for those who have tangible reasons to accept the regime's narrative -those who have benefited from it. In contrast, individuals whose lived experiences contradict the regime's self-portrayal are less susceptible to its indoctrinating efforts. Second, and more importantly, this article advances our understanding of how autocratic legacies shape post-transitional political attitudes, particularly democratic attitudes. By identifying the conditions under which indoctrination persists beyond regime change, this study offers critical insights into the development of democratic attitudes in emerging democracies, which are crucial for sustaining democratic consolidation and preventing democratic backsliding.</p><p>This article begins by reviewing the existing literature on indoctrination, emphasizing the gaps in understanding the specific mechanisms through which indoctrination shapes individual attitudes and behavior.</p><p>We then develop our theoretical framework through an analysis of Soviet educational indoctrination. The subsequent section details our data sources and methodological approach, with particular attention to the causal identification strategy employed. The empirical analysis follows, presenting our findings and demonstrating their robustness across various alternative specifications. We conclude by reflecting on the broader implications of our results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Indoctrination and Political Attitudes</head><p>Indoctrination is a critical tool in the strategic repertoire of authoritarian regimes, which rely on a combination of legitimation, repression, and cooptation to ensure legacies is still in its infancy." Therefore, while indoctrination can be highly influential, its effects are unlikely to be uniform across individuals, even when they are exposed to indoctrination during the same formative ages. Against this backdrop, it becomes essential to investigate the conditions that make indoctrination more or less effective.</p><p>In this study, we focus on Soviet indoctrination during the immediate post-war period in the three Baltic countries of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, which were incorporated into the Soviet Union following their occupation by the Red Army in 1944. We propose a two-step argument. First, consistent with the existing literature, we focus on the role of indoctrination through early-age socialization in education. Second, we argue that while such indoctrination can be powerful, its effects are not uniform. We suggest that indoctrination efforts are significantly moderated by individuals' lived experiences under the regime, which can mitigate its impact. Specifically, we argue that individuals who do not benefit from the authoritarian regime are significantly less likely to succumb to indoctrination.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Soviet Education and Indoctrination</head><p>Soviet indoctrination was importantly carried out through education. The education system was in fact the first encounter of the citizen with Soviet institutions <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Titma and Saar 1995)</ref>. Given the collectivist logic of Communism, the education system provided very little freedom of choice, and focused on the elite-defined needs of the society as a whole (ibid.). The Soviet school system started with general schooling of 8 grades, which normally ran from the age of 7 to 14 <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Titma and Saar 1996)</ref>. At the age of 15, which ended compulsory schooling, students were tracked into general secondary schools, specialized secondary schools, or into vocational training. <ref type="bibr">Titma and Saar (1995: 39)</ref> suggest that while 100% of students completed the first 8 compulsory classes, only about 60% continued schooling beyond the age of 15. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Regime Experience and Indoctrination</head><p>Importantly, we argue that the long-term effects of indoctrination are, however, significantly conditioned by individuals' lived experiences under the Soviet regime.</p><p>While Soviet schooling exerted great socializing effort on school children likely to persist throughout their lives, this propaganda was largely semantic, and frequently misaligned with lived experience. Perhaps most astutely observed in Václav Havel's famous essay</p><p>The Power of the Powerless (1978: section IV), the communist regime "is a world of appearances trying to pass for reality," and as such is "thoroughly permeated with hypocrisy and lies" (ibid.). Havel goes on to describe what amounts to a profound cognitive dissonance between the dictates of official doctrine and the experienced lives under communist authoritarianism.</p><p>Cognitive dissonance is an incongruence between two perceptions, such as smoking while knowing that it is bad for your health <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Festinger 1957)</ref>. Individuals may respond to cognitive dissonance in a number of ways, such as discounting dissonant information, lowering its salience, seeking alternative information, or changing their behavior (Harmon-Jones and Mills 2019). We expect that Soviet citizens who experienced cognitive dissonance between official regime propaganda and their everyday realities employed all of these strategies to cope with the discomfort caused by this dissonance.</p><p>A common avenue, described by numerous observers of communist regimes, was paying formal lip service to the official expectations of the regime, while privately sharing its absurdity with family and close friends (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Pipes 2001</ref>). <ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">2</ref>Consequently, we hypothesize that the influence of elementary school indoctrination is significantly moderated by the extent to which individuals experience cognitive dissonance between the official regime propaganda which they must parrot, and the world around them that they actually experience. We expect that this dissonance will be greater for individuals who did not benefit from the Soviet regime <ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">3</ref> . Conversely, cognitive dissonance should be less pronounced among individuals who did benefit from it. These individuals may perceive less dissonance or may be more inclined to discount information that contradicts official doctrine. Taking this into account, we argue that individuals exposed to indoctrination but not benefiting from the regime are significantly less likely to support authoritarianism following transitions to democracy, and are more likely to support democracy instead.</p><p>Hypothesis 2 Benefiting from the Soviet regime moderates the effect of educational indoctrination on support for democracy. Individuals who did not benefit are less susceptible to indoctrination, resulting in lower support for (Soviet) authoritarianism and higher democratic preferences, compared to those who did benefit from the regime.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Soviet Regime Benefits</head><p>An important concern we encounter is how to best assess whether a person benefited from the Soviet regime or not. Given that our data is retrospective -collected after the collapse of the Soviet regime -it is difficult to rely on subjective measures of perceived regime benefits, as these may capture Soviet benefits, or any other confounding factors that may affect democratic preferences. Importantly, any benefits from the Soviet regime would have been received after the 'treatment' of Soviet education, which began in the late 1940s. To address this, we leverage our knowledge of specific educational trajectories of individuals. In particular, we consider whether a person completed specialized technical secondary education, in the so-called "Tekhnikum." Tekhnikums were specialized secondary schools that trained semi-professionals, such as technicians, machine operators, or nurses, for specific industries <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Titma and Saar 1996)</ref>. While</p><p>Tekhnikums provided graduates with certification that allowed them to pursue higher university education, the majority ended their formal education upon graduating from these specialized secondary schools and entered the industrial sectors for which they were trained (Titma and Saar 1995). <ref type="foot" target="#foot_3">4</ref>Tekhnikums were a crucial source of skilled technical semi-professional labor essential to the Soviet system, particularly during its industrial expansion in the immediate postwar period <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Jenkins 1990</ref>). During this time, the Soviet regime placed great emphasis on widespread industrialization, relying heavily on the implementation of mechanization and process automation <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Simon 1954)</ref>. Tekhnikums were so central to the provision of technical labor that they were established and operated by individual sector ministries, which recruited employees for state-run production directly from among their graduates <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Peters 1956</ref>). Consequently, students of these schools were tracked from the age of 15 and trained in these specialized institutions to prepare them for their future roles in the Soviet system <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Titma and Saar 1995)</ref>. These graduates represented, in a sense, the vanguard of the Soviet regime. They were in high demand within a system taking pride in its rapid industrial expansion, and its symbolic elevation of the small (these were not university-educated engineers, nor regime elites), but technically competent machine operators.</p><p>The Soviet system effectively elevated the social status of these technical semi-professionals in both social and economic terms. As Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> demonstrates, technical secondary school graduates were over-represented in the third income quartile, underlining their relatively privileged economic position. Furthermore, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Jenkins (1990:</ref> 59) reports that a large percentage of technical students "see technical education as providing a basis for social mobility...", a claim supported by our data. Specifically, 82.2% of technical school graduates reported achieving a higher level of education than their parents, compared to only 69.0% among other educational groups.</p><p>We thus argue that graduating from a Tekhnikum, an outcome largely determined by one's education choice prior to the age of 15 <ref type="foot" target="#foot_4">5</ref> , and which selects an individual into a practically useful, economically rewarded, and symbolically elevated social group in the Soviet system, is a reasonable operationalization of benefiting from the Soviet regime.</p><p>Our data underline the appropriateness of this choice by showing that Tekhnikum graduates' retrospective evaluation of the Soviet regime is significantly more positive than those of other groups. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref> empirically shows that technical school graduates are significantly more likely to report having benefited from the Soviet system than others. This demonstrates that, despite the choice to pursue technical education being made prior to the end of one's elementary education (before the year in which one turns <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15)</ref>, its effect has a long-lasting influence.</p><p>Our theory rests on two core expectations. First, children who experienced Soviet elementary education (turned 15 <ref type="foot" target="#foot_5">6</ref> on or after the Soviet occupation of 1944), were exposed to Soviet indoctrination, and their support for democracy should be on average lower than that of children who did not experience Soviet elementary education (turned 15 before 1944). Second, the effect of Soviet indoctrination is conditioned by individuals' lived experiences under the Soviet regime. Among those who experienced Soviet schooling, indoctrination is expected to be particularly effective for individuals who benefited from the regime -a condition we proxy through attendance at technical secondary schools (Tekhnikums) -but not necessarily for those with different educational (and thus occupational) trajectories.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 1: Average Individual Income Distribution by Non-Technical School and Technical School Graduates</head><p>To summarize, we expect the impact of indoctrination to be significant for those who benefited from the Soviet regime (i.e., those who attended technical secondary schools after the Soviet takeover), resulting in lower support for democracy, and higher support for authoritarianism <ref type="foot" target="#foot_6">7</ref> . Those who did not benefit from the regime (i.e., those who did not attend technical secondary schools) should be more likely to experience cognitive dissonance between Soviet indoctrinating propaganda and their lived realities. For this group, we expect the effect of Soviet elementary education to attenuate towards zero, and these individuals to have similar views of democracy as those who did not experience Soviet indoctrination at all. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data</head><p>Our empirical design utilizes data from the New Baltic Barometer I-VI Trend Dataset, spanning six waves from 1993 to 2004<ref type="foot" target="#foot_7">8</ref> (Rose 2010). These surveys were conducted in the three Baltic states -Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. They were administered in either a Baltic language or Russian, depending on the respondents' preference <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Rose 2000)</ref>. Our analysis focuses exclusively on respondents who answered the survey in one of the Baltic languages, as opposed to Russian. Given that the place of birth is not recorded for all respondents, we use the language divide to exclude Russian speakers from the analysis, keeping only speakers of one of the Baltic languages. We do this to minimize potential selection bias from individuals born in Russia who relocated to the Baltics during the occupation <ref type="bibr">(Rose 2000: 3)</ref>. Including Russian speakers would introduce two main challenges: first, the nationalistic effect, with the expectation that Russians might be more pro-Soviet, and therefore, more anti-democratic than Baltic-speaking respondents; second, these individuals might have been exposed to Soviet indoctrination through schooling in Russia, complicating our analysis since the surveys do not specify where the respondents received their education. Our analysis encompasses cohorts who finished their compulsory education between 1909 and 2001.</p><p>In order to correct for non-responses and the potential over-representation of respondents from certain regions (e.g., urban centers), we include survey weights that account for these differences<ref type="foot" target="#foot_8">9</ref> (Cox 2024).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Democratic Preferences</head><p>Our outcome variables, reflecting respondents' democratic preferences, are measured using three different approaches. authoritarianism. This third variable, also dichotomous, is assigned a value of one for respondents who either "strongly disagree" or "somewhat disagree" with the statement, "we would be better off if we were still part of the Soviet Union." This assessment occurs within the context of the question, which acknowledges the existence of the current democratic system <ref type="foot" target="#foot_9">10</ref> .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Regime Benefits</head><p>As previously mentioned, the reception of regime benefits is identified based on respondents' choice of attending or not attending technical schools. This decision is made pre-treatment, before the completion of respondent compulsory education.</p><p>Respondents who indicate that their highest level of education is "technical college" are considered part of the regime benefits sub-group, while all other respondents comprise the non-benefits sub-group.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Indoctrination</head><p>Due to the challenges in measuring indoctrination <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Neundorf et al. 2024</ref>), we take advantage of the exogenous variation in exposure to compulsory schooling before and after the Soviet occupation of the Baltic states in 1944 to establish our treatment and control groups. They correspond to cohorts either exposed or not exposed to Soviet indoctrination through the educational system. We detail our empirical strategy in the following section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Other Variables</head><p>Because our treatment focuses on the timing of completion of mandatory education, some authors have cautioned that there is a risk of introducing bias by including control variables that are themselves products of education (Marshall 2016; Cavaille and Marshall 2019). Therefore, to mitigate this risk, we control only for a pre-treatment variable accounting for the gender of respondents. Additionally, we incorporate survey-country and survey-year fixed effects, as well as covariates for town size at the time of the survey.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Empirical Strategy</head><p>We employ a Regression Discontinuity design to estimate the causal impact of Soviet indoctrination through education on democratic preferences. To understand the shaping of these preferences, we analyze two sub-samples of respondents: those who benefited from the regime by graduating from technical schools, and those who did not. This approach allows us to examine how the presence of regime benefits moderates the effect of indoctrination on post-transitional democratic preferences. For each sub-sample, we construct an RD design that distinguishes between cohorts who finished their mandatory schooling before the occupation -being too old to have experienced Soviet education;</p><p>and those who completed their education post-occupation -who were sufficiently young to be influenced by the Soviet educational system. We take advantage of the essentially exogenous timing of respondents' birth years, which determines the completion of their mandatory education at age of 15 <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Titma and Saar 1995)</ref>. This research strategy aligns with a broader field of studies that investigate shifts in political attitudes just before and immediately following the implementation of new educational reforms (see, for example:</p><p>Cavaille and Marshall 2019; Marshall 2016).</p><p>We define our treatment -being exposed to mandatory Soviet schooling -for respondent i from cohort j in country c as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">T reatment jc =        0 if year completion of mandatory education jc &lt; 1944, 1 if year completion of mandatory education jc ≥ 1944<label>(1)</label></formula><p>Then, we fit our model:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">y ijc = β Treatment jc + f (x jc ) + ε ijc ,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where y ijc corresponds to the three dependent variables capturing respondents' preference for democracy, f (x jc ) is a function of the running variable x jc : year of completion of mandatory education. f is a local linear regression using the Calonico, Cattaneo, and Titiunik (2014) recommended optimal bandwidth and default triangular kernel, as also recommended by <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Imbens and Lemieux (2008)</ref>.</p><p>We identify two treatment groups and two control groups, each corresponding to one of our two sub-samples. As mentioned, the first sub-sample includes respondents who attended and graduated from technical schools, having pursued careers associated with higher levels of benefits, and the second sub-sample includes respondents who did not attend Tekhnikums after completing their mandatory elementary education and therefore did not necessarily benefit from the regime (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">2</ref>). In the first sub-sample,   Hence, it can be inferred that respondents on either side of the discontinuity generally exhibit statistical similarity in the relevant covariates. This implies that individuals who received the treatment are not statistically distinguishable from those who did not, based on the observed characteristics.  <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">8</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Main Results</head><p>The results in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">3</ref> provide robust causal evidence that exposure to the indoctrinating effects of Soviet schooling results in a lower preference for democracy only among cohorts who also graduated from technical schools during the Soviet regime.</p><p>This seems to indicate that ideological indoctrination via the educational system is only effective if respondents also benefited from the regime, thus experiencing low levels of cognitive dissonance between what the regime preaches and promotes, and their own socioeconomic well-being and symbolic recognition under the regime. Our coefficients of interest represent the effect on democratic preferences of exposure to indoctrination through the Soviet schooling system, compared with exposure to no indoctrination.</p><p>Models 1-3 restrict the analysis to respondents who attended technical schools, pursuing careers associated with the distribution of greater regime benefits during the Soviet regime, while Models 4-6 correspond to those who did not attend technical schools, and thus, were less likely to be exposed to the same level of regime benefits. The consistency of these results remains when examining the effects of the treatment on the preference for democracy specifically when considered in opposition to Soviet Union authoritarianism. Column 3 indicates that respondents who benefited and were exposed to Soviet schooling indoctrination are 0.138 points more likely to prefer the Soviet autocratic regime over the current democracy. Column 6 shows that the results for those who were indoctrinated but did not experience regime benefits are statistically insignificant. Interestingly, the results in this column, although insignificant, are positive.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Specifically, as indicated in</head><p>While this model does not allow us to make a causal claim, it suggests a potential avenue for future studies. It is possible that when respondents are asked specifically whether they prefer Soviet authoritarianism or democracy, the cognitive dissonance associated with indoctrination paired with the lack of benefits is so high that these respondents actually exhibit positive democratic preferences compared to their preference for the Soviet regime. This could imply that cognitive dissonance produces a negative effect on preference for Soviet authoritarianism (a "punishment effect"), and consequently, a more positive preference for democracy.</p><p>When combined, these results suggest that treated respondents who pursued career paths associated with a higher distribution of benefits during the Soviet regime, and who indeed perceive themselves as having derived high levels of benefits from such regime (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref> ), are less likely to prefer democracy compared to treated respondents who did not follow such career paths, and who believe they did not benefit more during the regime than in the present day. Furthermore, the results indicate that indoctrination through Soviet schooling has a detrimental effect on democratic preferences-sometimes referred to as the "nostalgia for the past" effect-only when respondents follow educational paths leading to greater benefits during the regime.</p><p>These findings illuminate the mechanisms through which indoctrination operates, suggesting that education-based indoctrination is effective only when respondents have a baseline of material security provided by the regime. In fact, among those who did not follow educational paths leading toward greater benefits, the results are statistically insignificant, indicating that indoctrination alone may have no effect at all due to the presence of cognitive dissonance. More importantly, these results shed light on how autocratic legacies can undermine democratic attitudes following democratic transitions, particularly when autocrats leverage regime benefits to reinforce the effects of indoctrination. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cohort Analysis</head><p>To complement the causal quasi-experimental RD analysis, we also conducted an ordinary least squares (OLS) marginal analysis aimed at examining the perception of regime benefits by age cohort, assuming that different cohorts were exposed to varying levels of indoctrination. This analysis focuses on the perception of regime benefits during the Soviet regime by survey respondents, and how the marginal effect of these benefits affects democratic preferences.</p><p>The results, depicted in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref>, suggest that the level of indoctrination plays a crucial role in how benefits influence democratic preferences. In the first cohort (baseline), which was not exposed to indoctrination, the marginal effect of regime benefits on democratic preferences is small and statistically insignificant. In cohorts exposed to higher levels of indoctrination (cohorts 2 and 3), the marginal effect of benefits is greater, leading these cohorts to prefer democracy less compared to cohorts who were less exposed to indoctrination. In cohorts exposed to medium levels of indoctrination after Stalin's death (cohorts 4 and 5), the marginal effect of benefits on the outcome is smaller than in the previous two cohorts but still relatively high and statistically significant.</p><p>These results are consistent with the RD analysis, indicating that indoctrination and regime benefits have a cumulative and reinforcing effect on democratic preferences, with indoctrination being statistically insignificant when considered alone. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Robustness</head><p>To further highlight the validity of our findings, this section addresses three alternative mechanisms that could plausibly be associated with decreased democratic preferences following the second Soviet occupation of the Baltic States in 1944: the first Soviet occupation in 1940, the Nazi occupation of 1941, and, finally, decreased satisfaction with economic conditions at the time the surveys were carried out, which could potentially be endogenous to the RD main results. Additionally, following Cavaille and Marshall (2019), we also test a placebo reform occurring five years before our main cutoff date of 1944. The results of the robustness checks 12 clearly indicate that neither the two prior occupations of the Baltics, nor the effect of current socioeconomic conditions, nor the placebo reform, replicate our main findings.

By identifying the conditions that allow indoctrination to persist after regime change, this study provides valuable insights into the development of democratic attitudes in emerging democracies, which are crucial for fostering democratic consolidation and mitigating the risks of democratic backsliding.</p><p>1 Appendix A: Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref> -Full Results  </p><p>(5)    5 Appendix E: Bandwidth and Kernel Modifications</p></div>

The study of the effects of authoritarian indoctrination falls within a broader scholarship examining the impact of historical legacies on contemporary politics, particularly how autocratic antecedents shape current political outcomes (Pop-Eleches and Tucker 2017; Dinas and Northmore-Ball 2020). Indoctrination is often conceptualized as an alternative to political repression, aimed at securing regime legitimacy by fostering approval and support rather than instilling fear and violence (Gerschewski 2013; Neundorf et al. 2017). Recent research has increasingly focused on the long-term effects of ideological indoctrination on political attitudes and behavior following transitions to democracy. This growing body of work has demonstrated that exposure to authoritarian indoctrination significantly shapes political attitudes (Alesina and Fuchs-Schündeln 2007; Voigtländer and Voth 2015; Neundorf and Pop-Eleches 2020), influences political identification (Neundorf 2009; Dinas and Northmore-Ball 2020), affects democratic values (Darden and Grzymala-Busse 2006; Neundorf 2010; Neundorf et al. 2024), and alters levels of political participation (Pop-Eleches and Tucker 2013). The literature has examined the specific conditions under which authoritarian indoctrination succeeds or fails. Some studies suggest that indoctrination can on occasion lead to resistance, when individuals either politically disengage or come to support alternative political positions or organizations (Wittenberg 2006; Tertytchnaya 2020). Most works, however, are consensual in showing that indoctrination works best when carried out in early socialization, and particularly, during earlier education (Darden and Grzymala-Busse 2006; Dinas and Northmore-Ball 2020; Neundorf and Pop-Eleches 2020; Alesina, Giuliano and Reich 2021; Neundorf et al. 2024). Pop-Eleches and Tucker (2013: 45) show that the effects of ideological socialization in communist regimes was the strongest "for those who experienced communism in their early formative years (between ages six and seventeen)". These authors further show that the effectiveness of indoctrination increases "with the number of years an individual spent under communism". Similarly, Neundorf et al. (2024: 19) argue that "educational imprinting will have the strongest impact during a person's impressionable years", which also correspond, according to these authors, to the years of compulsory education, between the ages of 5 and 15. Alesina, Giuliano and Reich (2021: 2286) further highlight the role of compulsory education, showing that autocrats often use mass education "to nation-build, to indoctrinate in order to preserve the status quo, and to reduce the threat of overthrow". Yet, despite the growing work on different facets of authoritarian indoctrination and its legacies, Neundorf and Pop-Eleches (2020: 1843) suggest that "the study of the mechanisms underlying the production and reproduction of these [authoritarian]</figDesc></figure>

The control group includes those who attended technical schools but were not exposed to Soviet education, having completed mandatory education before 1944. This cohort of individuals completed their mandatory education just prior to the Soviet occupation, finishing in 1943, and subsequently enrolled in Tekhnikums in 1944 -the year of their establishment11 . Similarly, in the second sub-sample, the treatment group consists of those who finished mandatory schooling after 1944, being exposed to Soviet compulsory education (and indoctrination), while the control group includes those who were not exposed to Soviet schooling, having finished mandatory elementary schooling before 1944.11 It is plausible that these individuals were already predisposed towards technological fields and chose to enroll in Tekhnikums as soon as they became available in 1944. Alternatively, they may have initially enrolled in conventional secondary schools and later transferred to Tekhnikums.</figDesc></figure>

While this body of work has established that exposure to autocratic indoctrination can significantly shape political preferences and behavior in post-transitional contexts, the specific underlying mechanisms remain underexplored. This article contributes to this literature by analyzing the conditional effect of authoritarian indoctrination on democratic preferences. It argues that indoctrination is particularly effective in shaping long-term preferences when delivered through early socialization in elementary education. Additionally, and more importantly, it highlights the moderating influence of individuals' lived experiences under the regime on the enduring effects of indoctrination over time.This article empirically demonstrates that indoctrination works conditionally in the context of individuals receiving significant benefits the indoctrinating authoritarian regime. When the indoctrinating content of regime propaganda aligns with the lived experiences of individuals, indoctrination is significantly more likely to work than in cases where individuals experience cognitive dissonance between the heroic claims of the regime, and their lives. We make our case by examining the impact of the imposition of Soviet elementary education in the Baltic countries following their second Soviet occupation in 1944, while also considering the economic and symbolic benefits received by graduates of technical secondary schools during this period. We provide two important findings. First, that children exposed to elementary Soviet education (those who turned 15 on or after 1944) are less likely to support democracy than those who completed elementary education prior to the Soviet occupation (those who turned 15 before 1944). Second, we show that individuals exposed to Soviet indoctrination via elementary education, nonetheless, do not succumb to it uniformly. Those who are socioeconomically and symbolically elevated to the vanguard of the regime by virtue of completing secondary technical schooling, tracking them into growing Soviet industries, benefit from the regime, internalize their early indoctrination, and exhibit lower levels of democratic support. Those who follow other life paths likely encounter cognitive dissonance between classroom propaganda and their lived experience, which undermines the influence of earlier indoctrination, and produces higher levels of democratic support.</figDesc></figure>
