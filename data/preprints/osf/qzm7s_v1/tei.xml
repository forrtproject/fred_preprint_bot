<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) is one of the most frequently used laboratory stressors. Previous meta-analyses concluded that the TSST induces moderate but robust psychobiological stress responses in both adult and, recently, youth samples. With the present study, we focused on the salivary cortisol response and performed both a systematic review comprising 143 studies and a meta-analysis with 91 studies (N=8291 participants) (a) to investigate which and how different TSST variants have been used in children and adolescents (b) to provide an updated overview of the reported effect sizes, and (c) to identify previously reported and new potential moderators. Our results showed that TSST characteristics have been reported inconsistently, with generally similar administration characteristics for the major TSST versions TSST for Children (TSST-C), TSST Modified (TSST-M), and the original TSST regarding participant exclusion, administration time, preparation, total TSST duration, and jury set-up. After correcting for publication bias using PEESE residuals, we found the TSST to be an effective tool for inducing a salivary cortisol stress response (Hedge's g = 0.56, p&lt;.0001). Moderation analyses revealed that participant gender, number of judges, and the TSST's total duration were significant moderators. Exploratively speaking, higher baseline cortisol levels predicted lower baseline-peak reactivity. Overall, the TSST (with its specific adaptations) is a suitable instrument for inducing acute psychobiological stress responses in children and adolescents. In the interests of open and reproducible science, establishing reporting standards for both methods and results would be desirable for future studies to enable more robust moderation analyses.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The basic idea of the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST; <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Kirschbaum et al., 1993)</ref> as a laboratory procedure is to impose social-evaluative threat on an individual by generating anticipation and the perception of both uncontrollability and negative evaluation from others. This is supposed to lead to psychological and physiological stress responses in these individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Dickerson and Kemeny, 2004)</ref>. The original design was developed for an adult sample <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Kirschbaum et al., 1993)</ref> and consists of a preparation phase for a previously announced public speaking task, the public speaking task itself, and a surprise verbal arithmetic task. A panel of "judges" presides over all these phases and provides elements of social-evaluative threat.</p><p>The TSST is known as the gold standard for laboratory stress induction <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Allen et al., 2017)</ref>. Regarding the psychological stress reaction, the TSST has been shown to increase self-reported stress, anxiety, and negative mood in adult participants <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Allen et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">von Dawans et al., 2011)</ref>. In terms of physiological stress reactions, stress triggers the activation of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. In the first "faster" route, a "fight or flight response" is set off by the secretion of adrenaline and noradrenaline via the sympathomedullary pathway <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Allen et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Labuschagne et al., 2019)</ref>. Aside from the salivary alpha-amylase concentration <ref type="bibr">(Gordis et al., 2006)</ref>, the TSST has been shown to cause a significant increase in other relevant ANS activation markers such as, but not limited to, heart rate <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Childs et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Kudielka et al., 2004)</ref> and respiratory sinus arrythmia <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Ho et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Rozenman et al., 2018)</ref>. In the second "slower" route, the hypothalamus is stimulated to secrete corticotrophinreleasing hormone (CRH), which in turn promotes the release of adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) from the pituitary gland, through which the secretion of cortisol from the adrenal cortex is set off <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Allen et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Kudielka et al., 2007)</ref>. Salivary cortisol is a commonly used <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Goodman et al., 2017)</ref> and reliable <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Hellhammer et al., 2009)</ref> marker for HPA axis activation, and the TSST has been repeatedly shown to induce significant increases in adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Kirschbaum et al., 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">von Dawans et al., 2011)</ref>, adolescents <ref type="bibr">(Cameron et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Gunnar et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Kelly et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr">Yim et al., 2015)</ref>, and children (Buske- <ref type="bibr">Kirschbaum et al., 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr">Yim et al., 2015)</ref>. In their metaanalysis of acute stress effects in healthy adults, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Dickerson and Kemeny (2004)</ref> estimated stressors like the TSST that combined public speaking and cognitive tasks to have a "larger average effect size than the other stressor categories, <ref type="bibr">[…]</ref> with an effect size over two times as large as any other types of stressor" (p. 369). A more recent meta-analysis by <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Gu et al. (2022)</ref>, which examined acute stress effects in TSST studies on healthy adults, reported similar results.</p><p>In the 30 years since its original development, the TSST has been adapted for application in different age groups (typically adults, teenagers, or children) and experimental settings (solo or group), resulting in several specific TSST versions used by different research groups. These versions differ primarily in the topic of the public speech task, the durations of the different phases, the number of judges, and the story context in which the judges are introduced in (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). The versions, incidentally, often undergo additional adaptation to fulfill the needs of a specific research group, potentially compromising its validity and reproducibility <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Labuschagne et al., 2019)</ref>. In their meta-analysis, Narvaez Linares et al. ( <ref type="formula">2020</ref>) also highlighted significant differences across studies with adult samples and the need for a standardized reporting scheme to transparently communicate the TSST protocol used in individual studies. In their meta-analysis of 186 TSST studies on healthy adults, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Goodman et al. (2017)</ref> analyzed the moderating effects of common variations of the classic TSST protocol. They identified several significant moderators influencing participants' cortisol reactivity peaking around 35-45 minutes after stressor onset. Notable factors included the administration time of the TSST protocol (larger effects when administered between 2pm and 5pm), the acclimation time for the participant before the start of the protocol (larger effects with acclimation time between 16 and 30 minutes), the nature of tasks preceding the TSST protocol (larger effects in studies with stressful tasks beforehand), the magnitude of the subtraction number in the arithmetic task (larger effects in studies using larger subtraction numbers), as well as the composition of the judging panel in terms of number, gender, and facial feedback (larger effects in conjunction with mixed-gender juries consisting of two judges with neutral facial feedback).</p><p>Several years after the publication of the adult version of the TSST, the first adaptation for children was used to induce stress and investigate the acute response of the HPA axis in pediatric study samples <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">(Buske-Kirschbaum et al., 1997)</ref>. Subsequently, like in adult research, validated TSST protocols for children and adolescents have undergone various adaptations. For example, singing in front of the judges replaced the classic public speaking task <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Brand et al., 2011)</ref>, performance pressure was heightened by introducing the possibility of receiving an unwanted gift due to an unfavorable judgement by the jury <ref type="bibr">(de Veld et al., 2014a</ref><ref type="bibr">(de Veld et al., , 2014b))</ref>, and when the jury was seated behind a one-way mirror <ref type="bibr">(Hostinar et al., 2015a</ref><ref type="bibr">(Hostinar et al., , 2015b))</ref>.</p><p>In their recent meta-analysis, which focused on studies using the TSST with participants aged seven to 17 years, <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Seddon et al. (2020)</ref> considered all modifications of the original protocol such as these to provide a broad overview of the field. They assessed several biomarkers such as salivary cortisol, salivary alpha-amylase, heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, cardiac output, HRV, pre-ejection period, and respiratory sinus arrhythmia, and tested moderators of the stress response. Including data from 57 publications up to February 2018, <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Seddon et al. (2020)</ref> confirmed the TSST as an effective stressor for a youth sample with a moderate overall effect on cortisol levels after accounting for publication bias (d'=.47). The researchers identified age (younger children revealing a greater cortisol increase pre-post TSST than adolescents), sample type (community samples showing stronger increases than clinical samples), gender of the judges (mixed-gendered juries eliciting greater cortisol increases), total TSST duration (longer TSST duration eliciting higher increases), and time of administration (TSST in the afternoon) as significant moderators of cortisol reactivity. With the present work we want to update and expand upon the findings of <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Seddon et al. (2020)</ref> focusing on the stress related salivary cortisol response. In addition, a comprehensive overview of the application and methodology of the TSST in published studies with children and adolescents will be provided, similar to the work of Narvaez <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Linares et al. (2020)</ref> in the context of TSSTs with adult samples. To achieve this, we conducted a systematic review on studies using variations of the TSST procedure with healthy children and adolescents aged between 6 and 18 years of age. We evaluated these in terms of reported methodological characteristics to identify specific protocol variations that may influence the observed responses. Furthermore, we conducted a meta-analysis to estimate the overall effect of the TSST on the salivary cortisol (baseline-to-peak) responses in children and adolescents. This analysis also included analyses of established moderators reported previously (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Goodman et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Seddon et al., 2020)</ref> and potentially new moderators linked to various TSST versions and experimenter variables for the present nonadult samples.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Search strategy and study selection</head><p>On September 26 th 2023, we screened MEDLINE (PubMed), PsychINFO (Ovid), and Web of Science (Core collection) using the search term [("TSST" OR "Trier Social Stress") AND (children OR adolescents OR youth) NOT "toxic shock"] to capture published literature specifically related to the TSST in children and adolescents. References were exported to and managed in Zotero (www.zotero.org), which we used to identify and remove duplicates. Following the inclusion/exclusion criteria below, studies were first screened based on the titles and abstracts. Using the same criteria, full-text articles were then assessed for eligibility (see PRISMA flow chart in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Inclusion and exclusion criteria</head><p>Our meta-analysis employed a two-stepped inclusion/exclusion process. Firstly, peerreviewed studies were included in the systematic review if (1) the authors had carried out a TSST procedure or applied slight modifications still possessing the elements of evaluative threat (panel vs. video) and uncontrollability (arithmetic task after speech task), (2) the samples in the studies were aged between 6 and 18 years of age, and (3) the authors reported salivary cortisol as a measure for the physiological stress response. Studies were excluded if they <ref type="bibr">(1)</ref> were not published in English, (2) only featured a clinical sample, or (3) included additional stressors that could influence the salivary cortisol output triggered by the TSST.</p><p>Secondly, data from this pool was included in our meta-analysis if it was derived from studies that (1) used a TSST setup meant to produce stress (in comparison to a control setup or a setup with reduced stress), (2) observed a healthy<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> (control) sample with information about the sample size, and (3) reported mean cortisol values with standard deviation or standard error for at least one baseline sampling time and one post TSST sampling time. Data was excluded if <ref type="bibr">(1)</ref> cortisol data was reported as aggregated measures only (AUCi or AUCg) or (2) relevant withingroup variances (SD or SEM) were unavailable<ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">2</ref> .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Data extraction, coding, and preparation</head><p>The first author performed all data extraction and moderator coding. The first 100 papers were used as training material to settle uncertainties in paper classification and data coding through discussion with the last author.</p><p>All titles and abstracts were screened for studies using the TSST with a youth sample. For the systematic review, full articles were coded for the participants' age range , the time window of the individual assessments, the adaptation time window in the lab before the start of the TSST routine, the saliva sampling method (i.e., Salivettes), the total number of saliva samples taken during the assessment, the saliva sampling times relative to the start of the TSST, the TSST version used (i.e., TSST, TSST-C, TSST-M), the duration of the phases of the TSST used, details about the judges (number of judges, gender composition, behavior toward the participants), details about the experimenter (gender, behavior toward the participants, double role as judge), details about presented data (reported responder rates to the TSST, the responder rate itself, the responder criterium used), and exclusion criteria used (in reference to the participants themselves and, if applicable, their parents).</p><p>For the meta-analysis, usable studies from the qualitative data pool were screened for healthy control sample data and coded for descriptive data (sample size, gender composition, mean age) of the healthy control sample, as well as all available salivary cortisol data (mean and error by sampling time, unit used). Data provided in graphs was extracted using the WebPlotDigitizer <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Rohatgi, 2022)</ref>, while log-transformed data was transformed into approximal raw data using methods described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Higgins and Green (2008)</ref>. If the data provided (reported via table or graph) was not usable for this meta-analysis or deemed invalid after transformation (eg. too high for the essay used), the first author contacted the corresponding author for the required raw data. If the data was provided by mid-October 2023, it was included in the quantitative analysis. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Data analysis</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.1">Calculation of effect sizes</head><p>The goal of this meta-analysis was to assess baseline to peak differences in salivary cortisol before and after participation in the TSST. A standardized mean difference (SMD or Cohen's d) effect size was therefore used. The standardization of mean differences utilized the pooled standard deviation of baseline and peak cortisol responses. To calculate the standard errors of SMDs, the correlation between baseline and peak cortisol responses was set to medium r=.3 (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Borenstein et al., 2011)</ref>. To mitigate any small sample bias in effects, all Cohen's d were transformed into Hedge's g, and the standard error of g were calculated. A Hedge's g higher than zero indicates that salivary cortisol levels were higher after TSST exposure in comparison to the baseline, and values lower than zero indicate that salivary cortisol levels fell after the TSST.</p><p>To facilitate calculation, we defined the standard measuring unit for salivary cortisol in this meta-analysis as nmol/l. Raw data provided in other measuring units (i.e., ng/ml or µg/dl) were transformed into nmol/l. Provided standard errors were transformed into standard deviations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.2">Heterogeneity</head><p>In the meta-analysis, random-effects modeling was employed to account for potential heterogeneity among the included studies. The Q statistic was calculated to assess the presence of heterogeneity among the effect sizes. The Q statistic is a measure of the dispersion of effect sizes and is calculated as the weighted sum of squared differences between individual study effects and the overall effect. A significant Q statistic indicates the presence of variability beyond what would be expected by chance alone, prompting further exploration of potential sources of heterogeneity through subgroup analyses or meta-regression. Parameters in random-effects modeling were estimated using a restricted (residual) maximum likelihood (REML) estimation model. For all analyses, a cutoff of p &lt; .05 was used for significance.

Overall, 111 studies (77.6%) systematically delivered information on the duration of both the acclimation time before starting the TSST and the TSST phases individually. Fourteen studies (9.8%) did not report on the acclimation time while reporting information on the TSST phases. 13 papers (9.1%) did provide the acclimation time, but not on (all) the TSST phases with most (n=10) not including any phase durations, two not mentioning the preparation phase and one not reporting the duration of any task. Finally, five papers (3.5%) failed to report on either acclimation time or phase durations. A Pearson's Chi-Squared test showed no significant evidence for an association between the TSST version used and information reported on acclimation time and duration of TSST phases (χ2(21)=18.61, p =.610).</p><p>Phase durations. On average, participants became acclimated to the experimental setting for 32.66 ± 19.92 minutes (n=124; 0 -120 minutes) and had 5.15 ± 1.93 minutes (n=126; 2 -10 minutes) of preparation time before performing for 4.91 ± 0.59 minutes (n=128; 2 -6 minutes) in the public speaking task and 4.80 ± 0.61 minutes (n=128; 1 -5 minutes) in the arithmetic task with the entire TSST taking 14.86 ± 2.28 minutes (n=125; 6 -20 minutes). Comparing the means between TSST-C, TSST-M and the TSST (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">S2</ref>), the Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test showed no significant differences in the duration of the preparation phase, H(2)=4.73, p=.094, or in the TSST's total duration , H(2)=2.86, p=.238.

Only six studies (n=5 using the TSST-C) specified that that occurred right before the preparation phase.</p><p>Details about jury. One hundred and sixteen (81.1%) studies reported on the number of judges (79.3% using two judges). 21 studies reported on the judges-to-participant gender ratio in general with most (76.2%) reporting mixed-gender juries. 59 studies reported on non-verbal feedback given by the jury, and 91.5% of these described neutral behavior.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.1">Mean effect size</head><p>Testing overall homogeneity, our results suggest that it is unlikely that effect sizes originated from the same population (Q(122)=927.58, p&lt;.0001, I 2 =90.8%). Indeed, the betweenstudy variance (σ 2 =.24) was substantial, thus justifying that we employed random-effects modeling to analyze the data. Results of the mixed effects model showed the TSST's medium effect on the average baseline-to-peak salivary cortisol response (k=123; g=. <ref type="bibr">61, z=12.84, p&lt;.0001)</ref>.

Sensitivity analysis indicated two extreme outliers (k=123, z=12.84, p&lt;.0001; see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S5a</ref>). Removing these two outliers from the meta-regression resulted in a significant influence of the publication year (k=121, zyear=-3.11, p&lt;.01) with earlier studies reporting higher effect sizes (see Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S4b</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S5b</ref>). Egger's test (k=121, z=5.36, p&lt;.0001) and PET-PEESE consistently yielded significant evidence for publication bias (PET: k=121; βse=2.37, p&lt;.0001; PEESE: βvg=5.47, p&lt;.0001).

In contrast, PEESE intercept still indicated a significant "true" effect of the TSST on salivary cortisol after removing publication bias (k=121; β0 PEESE =.32, p&lt;.0001). While conventions suggest the use of PET estimators if the PET intercept is not significantly different from 0 <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Carter et al., 2019)</ref>, we note that 90.2% of the reported effect sizes in this analysis were larger than zero (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3</ref>). Thus, while PET may yield overcorrected estimators (as also noted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Aksayli et al., 2019)</ref>, PEESE may be considered to offer more reliable estimators for the present data. This suggests a moderate (publication bias corrected) effect regarding the baseline-to-peak cortisol response to the TSST (k=121; g =.56, z=14.96, p&lt;.0001).</p></div>

Since the PEESE calculation of residuals aims to remove publication bias, their results were estimated to be more reliable, hence indicating stable moderation.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.2">Exploratory analyses</head><p>Moderation of effect size by baseline cortisol. The cortisol awakening response (CAR; <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Pruessner et al., 1997</ref>) is a well-established circadian pattern defined by a spike in cortisol level after the first awakening in the morning and a slow fall throughout the day. This variation in readily available cortisol in participants (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Adam et al., 2006)</ref> might in turn systematically affect and moderate the cortisol reactivity to the TSST (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Kudielka et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Schommer et al., 2003)</ref>, which can be tested by either focusing on the administration time or the measured baseline cortisol itself. In their meta-analysis, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Goodman et al. (2017)</ref> tested this potential first moderation and recommended that TSSTs be administered in the afternoon between 2pm and 5pm to ensure maximum pre-to-post TSST cortisol reactivity. In an attempt to replicate their results, we divided the studies in this review into "early" (before 12pm, k=4), "midday" (between 12pm and &lt;2pm, k=30), and "late" (after 2pm, k=62) starters by the administration window start and entered into a moderation analysis. This model, however, did not reach significance, Q(2)=2.96, p=.228. A second model that combined the first two classes into an analysis "early" (k=34) vs. "late" (k=62) starters to even out the group sizes, did not reach significance either, Q(1)=.69, p=.405. Since this could be due to still very dissimilar group sizes, we decided to test the second moderation model with the measured baseline cortisol itself.</p><p>An initial moderation model including all effect sizes (k=121) did not reach significance, Q(1)=3.36, p=0.067. Descriptively though, we noted a trend toward a negative effect of higher baseline cortisol, β=-.038. se=.0209, z=-1.8334. A bubble plot further revealed potential extreme outliers in baseline cortisol (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">S6a</ref>) that might have suppressed a significant moderation effect. To remove extreme outliers, a sample size weighed the average of the baseline cortisol was calculated (M=4.057, SD=1.836) and used to define a cut-off of two standard deviations over and under the mean. Thus, all effect sizes produced by baseline cortisol measurements in the average range (0.383nmol/l -7.729nmol/l, k=116) were entered into the second moderation analysis. This new model was significant, Q(1)=5.998, p=0.014. Model results revealed a small negative effect, β=-.0681. se=.0278, z=-2.4491, [-.1226, -.0136], suggesting higher baseline cortisol producing lower effect sizes pre-to-post TSST (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">S6b</ref>).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p>The present work investigated the experimental stress induction in children and adolescents with the Trier Social Stress Test with a special focus on the modulation by specific protocol variations.</p><p>Our systematic review of 143 studies identified three predominantly used TSST versions: the TSST-C (65.7%) and TSST-M (16.1%) specifically adapted for the full youth age spectrum, and the original TSST (9.1%) employed in adolescents to young adult samples. TSST tasks included in the TSST-M were significantly shorter than in the other two versions. Most of the studies employed a mixed-gender panel with two members usually giving non-verbal, neutral feedback. A majority of studies reported excluding participants presenting factors known to affect HPA functioning such as endocrinologically relevant medications, acute/chronic mental and physical health issues (each in more than 50% of studies). Notably, a significant amount of methodological details (up to 90% of data per observed variable) could not be extracted due to limited information in the publications.</p><p>Our meta-analysis summarizing 91 studies (k=121, N=8177) with mainly mixed-gendered and mixed-aged samples revealed a medium overall baseline-to-peak effect (Hedge's g = 0.56), which is in line with the overall effect reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Seddon et al. (2020;</ref><ref type="bibr">Cohen's d = 0.47)</ref> indicating that the TSST's youth-specific adaptations are effective tools to elicit salivary cortisol responses in children and adolescents in general. We identified no significant differences between the TSST-C and TSST-M in terms of cortisol reactivity. However, the number of judges, gender of participants, the total duration of the TSST and baseline cortisol levels, as well as the interaction of age groups and TSST versions turned out to be significant moderators, all of which are discussed below.</p><p>Our first major finding is the observation that youth samples exhibit a less pronounced cortisol stress reaction to the TSST than do adult samples, which is consistent with previous reports. <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Seddon et al. (2020)</ref> also reported on medium pre-to-post TSST effect sizes in youth samples, while adult samples showed large effect sizes, estimated consistently at d = 0.925 <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Goodman et al., 2017)</ref> and d = 0.930 <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Gu et al., 2022)</ref> in meta-analyses. What are the possible explanations for this reduced cortisol responsiveness in children and adolescents compared to adults? First, children and adolescents might perceive the TSST's specific adaptations as less stressful and thus tend to exhibit a blunted stress response to this laboratory stressor. This assumption is supported by the fact that in some studies with younger children, the aspect of social threat in particular (e.g., by refusing verbal/non-verbal feedback) is made milder to keep the stress in the participating children at a tolerable and ethically acceptable level. An indirect indication of the presumed effect of lower social threat in the children's TSST can perhaps be derived from the observation that the cortisol response is significantly stronger when at least two people are present in the panel. Unfortunately, the statistical power here is limited, as there are very few studies involving a single-person panel. It is also possible that the experimental procedures were terminated more frequently in children due to particularly severe stress reactions in children, although this remains speculative and cannot be conclusively assessed due to the lack of usable data from both children/adolescents and adults. The second explanation is based on the assumption that the HPA axis matures during childhood and adolescence. There is some supporting evidence for this, suggesting that the HPA axis attains its maximum responsiveness in adolescence or young adulthood. However, within the age range from 9 to 18 years, the results appear paradoxical. <ref type="bibr">Seddon et al. (2022)</ref> reported stronger cortisol responses in children than adolescents. In contrast to this, <ref type="bibr">Gunnar et al. (2009)</ref> directly compared age groups in their single study and reported that adolescents (13-15-year-olds) tended to show a stronger cortisol response to the TSST than children (9-11-year-olds). Another study reported the same pattern, whereby the effect was particularly pronounced in performance-related tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Stroud et al., 2009)</ref>. In the present meta-analysis, which relies on a significantly larger number of effect sizes, we were able to confirm this effect in neither one direction nor the other. A significant age effect was detected only in conjunction with the TSST-M, a finding in line with <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Seddon et al. (2020)</ref> that might be attributable to the wider age range of participants in those studies. Since acute cortisol responsiveness can hardly be compared because of the significant differences between the stressors used in child/adolescent studies and adult studies, this question will remain unanswered as long as longitudinal studies are lacking on the development of HPA axis reactivity using experimental paradigms.</p><p>Aside from this, developmental interactions with other stress-responsive hormonal systems such as gonadal steroids <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Domes et al., 2024)</ref>, accumulating experiences with TSST-like everyday situations <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Wüst et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Batabyal et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Barthel et al., 2024)</ref>, age-related differences in stress coping styles as a trait <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Illius et al., 2024)</ref> and in stress management strategies as a state <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Goessl et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Thabrew et al., 2018)</ref>, daily life stressors <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Weber et al., 2022)</ref>, and the socioeconomic and health status of the family <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Lupien et al., 2000)</ref> are some of the known influence factors that might account at least partially for the reduced cortisol responsiveness in children and adolescents, either by themselves or in interaction with each other. Some of the moderators identified in previous meta-analyses were confirmed in our analysis. ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>) Sample gender was a significant moderator in our analysis, but the direction of the effect was heterogenous: while Seddon et al. ( <ref type="formula">2020</ref>) reported higher cortisol responses in mixedgender samples compared to exclusively male and female samples; our analysis suggests that girls exhibit the highest responsiveness to the TSST. This effect contrasts with studies in adults indicating that men display larger effects than women <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Gu et al. 2022)</ref>. At this point, it seems plausible that the fluctuation of sex steroids in pubertal girls <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Ordaz and Luna, 2012)</ref> and the increased cortisol binding capacity in women using oral contraceptives <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Liu et al., 2017)</ref> could explain these effects.</p><p>(2) As in previous studies in adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Goodman et al. 2017)</ref>, the number of judges was a significant moderator: More than one judge resulted in significantly larger cortisol reactions in both youth and adult samples, which might be simply due to the higher level of social threat and uncontrollability induced by two or more panel members.</p><p>(3) In addition, neutral feedback in the sense of social unresponsiveness seemed to trigger a stronger cortisol response than feedback with emotional valence. However, we observed no moderation by judges' gender, in contrast to previous findings in both children/adolescents and adults, which reported stronger cortisol responses to mixed-gender than to all-female panels <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Goodman et al., 2017</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">, Seddon et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>(4) For protocol variations, the TSST's duration was a significant moderator in both this meta-analysis and Seddon et al. ( <ref type="formula">2020</ref>)'s analysis with longer durations resulting in higher effect sizes, which might reflect a stress "dosage" effect. Although other stressors are much shorter combining a pain stimulus with social evaluation (eg, the socially evaluated cold pressor test, SECPT; <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Schwabe et al. 2008</ref>), a minimal TSST duration might be needed to activate the HPA axis. Although our analysis did not confirm that the time of day at which the TSST was carried out (morning vs. afternoon) was a significant moderator, the trend we observed is in line with <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Seddon et al. (2020)</ref> who reported larger effects in the afternoon. This may be largely due to the fact that cortisol levels gradually decline during the day, with low levels in the later afternoon, potentially leaving more room for pronounced reactions to acute challenges. In line with this assumption, our exploratory analysis suggested that low baseline cortisol levels predicted higher cortisol responses to the TSST. Some limitations of the present study need to be considered. Firstly, we were unable to find a significant amount of data in the original publications (15-90% of observable instances, depending on the observed variable) extending across all areas of interest in our systematic review anddata that could not be extracted for this qualitative description and quantitative meta-analysis. We were therefore unable to carry out all the analyses we had planned and those we did perform sometimes have low statistical power. In line with this, over a third of the papers identified in our systematic review were excluded from our meta-analysis because of missing cortisol data. This, too, represents a significant loss of information that could not affect both moderator analyses as well as a general estimation of global effects and publication bias. Thirdly, note that we omitted unpublished data. Finally, we focused on studies with unselected samples or healthy samples to provide estimates as unaffected as possible by clinical or subclinical condition. We are aware that this decision reduces the variability within the dataset and presumably compromises the generalizability of our analysis. A follow-up analysis could explicitly include different clinical samples and compare the effects seen between disorders and levels of symptom severity.</p><p>Two implications should also be mentioned: The first one is the lack of methodological details in many original studies, which hindered a full-scale moderator analysis in this and previous meta-analyses of all potentially available data. In our opinion, this status quo reveals the need for consensus guidelines, and reporting standards for future studies (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Stalder et al., 2022</ref>, for the cortisol awakening response) and open data to enable qualitative and quantitative syntheses in the future. This is in line with the general desire to provide full methodological details and primary data for secondary research synthesis and to at least partially overcome the replication crises <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Narvaez Linares et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Pennington, 2023)</ref>.</p><p>The second implication refers to the weaker overall reactivity to be expected from the TSST in youth samples than in adult samples. This should be considered when classifying individuals into "responders" and "non-responders" based on their peak-to-baseline responses. The traditionally used hard baseline-to-peak cut-offs of 1.5nmol/l or 2.5nmol/l might not be suitable in children and adolescents. The 10% increase-criterion defined by <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Ji et al. (2016)</ref> and the 15.5% increase-criterion by <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Miller et al. (2013)</ref> might be more suitable, however their validity in children and adolescents still need to be tested.</p><p>In conclusion: the present meta-analysis together with previous studies show that the TSST with its specific adaptations for children and adolescent is an effective tool for inducing cortisol stress responses in a youth sample. The cumulative evidence in children/adolescents (TSST-C and TSST-M) and adults (TSST) suggests that the protocol is most effective when it is performed as intended by the original design: in full length with at least two mixed-gendered judges giving neutral, non-verbal feedback to the participanteven in studies involving the TSST's specific adaptations for children and adolescents. On the other hand, the data available to date provide no indication that it makes a difference which of the two main variants for children (TSST-C vs. TSST-M) is used.  Note.
