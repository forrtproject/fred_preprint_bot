<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Salamander larvae can impose a great impact on benthic organisms as they are keystone predators. Previous gut analysis revealed that their diet consists of invertebrates from the water column and benthic taxa. The impact on benthic communities, especially on meiofauna, is, however, not well understood yet, as these organisms cannot be detected reliably in the gut. To avoid this, we investigated the impact of fire salamander larvae on meiofauna by analyzing consumed prey items from a microcosm. Fire salamander larvae can be found in different habitats, such as streams and ponds. To test the impact of fire salamander larvae on the meiofauna and to test whether the effects differ in larvae from different habitats, we collected 20 larvae from both, ponds and streams from the wild and transferred them to the lab. We placed each larva individually into a microcosm with sediment and benthic organisms. We also added control samples without larvae. We kept the larvae either for one week or two weeks and counted the number of nematodes, oligochaetes and rotifers after we removed the larvae.</p><p>Fire salamander larvae significantly reduced the meiofauna. Furthermore, fire salamander larvae show habitat specific differences, as nematodes were influenced more strongly by pond larvae during the first week. Oligochaetes were mainly influenced by stream larvae, but not by pond larvae, independent of the duration of the experiment. Rotifers were influenced by larvae from both habitats, but only during the first week and not during the second week.</p><p>Our findings suggest that fire salamander larvae are able to reduce the meiofauna through predation. Furthermore, our finding indicates an adaptation towards the different environmental conditions in the habitat of origin.</p></div>

The results of numerous studies on the gut contents indicate that their diet includes invertebrates from the water column as well as benthic taxa such as insect larvae (e.g., Chaoboridae, Culicidae and Chironomidae), crustaceans (e.g., Copepoda, Cladocera and Isopoda) and oligochaetes <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Cecala et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Benoy, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Regester et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Reinhardt et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Trice et al., 2015)</ref> . In addition, cannibalism has been observed <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Hoffman &amp; Pfennig, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Wildy et al., 2001)</ref> . Fire salamander larvae can occur in different habitats and food composition of pond and stream larvae can differ greatly <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Brophy &amp; Pauley, 1997)</ref> . By exerting top-down pressure, salamander larvae can significantly reduce the abundance of certain planktic and macrobenthic taxa in lentic systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Holomuzki et al., 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Benoy, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Regester et al., 2008)</ref> , which in turn may have indirect effects on other species of the community <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Morin, 1981;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Wissinger et al., 1999)</ref> . Furthermore, the ingestion of aquatic insect larvae regulates the number of hatching insects and thus also affects surrounding terrestrial habitats <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Regester et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Reinhardt et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Reinhardt et al., 2017)</ref> .</p><p>With increasing larval development and body size, the prey spectrum also increases, which is often explained by the larger mouth size and thus the ability to handle larger prey <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Dodson &amp; Dodson, 1971;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Petranka, 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Cecala et al., 2007)</ref> . <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bell (1975)</ref> studied the feeding habits of newt larvae and attributed this change in food intake to a shift from ambush predation to more active hunting behavior during the course of larval development. Although it is assumed that diet composition largely reflects the composition of prey in the habitat <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Deban &amp; Wake, 2000)</ref> and corresponding seasonal changes <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Brophy &amp; Pauley, 1997)</ref> , there are studies that indicate specialized hunting by salamander larvae <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Dodson &amp; Dodson, 1971;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Takagi &amp; Miyashita, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Struecker et al., 2021)</ref> , such as a preference for slower prey. However, the trophic impact of salamander larvae on endobenthic organisms, especially meiofauna like oligochaetes, nematodes or microcrustaceans (benthic organisms that pass through a sieve with 500 μm meshes and are retained by a 20 μm sieve, according to <ref type="bibr">Ptatscheck et al., 2020b )</ref>,</p><p>is not yet fully understood and studies from lotic habitats are largely absent (but see <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bletz et al., 2016 )</ref>. However, meiofauna is found in high abundances (sometimes &gt; one million ind. m -2 ) in headwater streams or ponds <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bert et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Majdi et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Rebecchi et al., 2020)</ref> and represents a standing stock of food resources for larger organisms like macroinvertebrates or juvenile fish, but cannot be reliably detected by gut analysis due to their rapid digestion <ref type="bibr">(Ptatscheck et al., 2020a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Ptatscheck, 2021)</ref> .</p><p>All salamander larvae are suction feeder creating a water inflow by opening their mouths and expanding the buccal cavity to ingest prey organisms at close range (reviewed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Deban &amp; Wake, 2000 )</ref>. The water is then released outwards through the gill slits. Gut analysis of Desmognathus aeneus larvae revealed a 16% proportion of detritus in the digestive tract <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Donovan &amp; Folkerts, 1972)</ref> , showing that the feeding process is not just prey ingestion. At the same time, however, high densities of endobenthic meiofauna, such as nematodes or microcrustaceans were found in the gut <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Brophy, 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Brophy &amp; Pauley, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Trice et al., 2015)</ref> , whose uptake cannot be explained by selective uptake from the sediment surface or by accidental bycatch alone. Rather, this indicates that sediments could also be ingested directly, and the small prey could be filtered out. In fact, the larvae of several salamander taxa, such as fire salamander (Salamandra salamandra) possess gill rakers, spiny protrusions on the gill arches that allow them to retain food particles in the oral cavity <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Stadtmüller, 1924;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Stebbins &amp; Cohen, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Deban &amp; Wake, 2000)</ref> . These structures are already present in embryos and their number on the gill arches and size continue to increase during larval development before being reduced during metamorphosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Stadtmüller, 1924)</ref> . Similar morphological structures also enable bottom-biting fish like carps or gudgeons to effectively filter small organisms from the sediment and affect their abundance, biomass and diversity through strong top-down pressure <ref type="bibr">(Ptatscheck et al., 2020a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Ptatscheck, 2021)</ref> .</p><p>In our study we investigate the impact of fire salamander larvae on benthic communities, focusing on meiofauna. Fire salamander females deposit fully developed juveniles in both headwater streams as well as in ponds <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Weitere et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Sabino-Pinto et al., 2019)</ref> . In contrast to lotic habitats, ponds are characterized by periodic desiccations, higher temperatures, lower oxygen levels, higher predation risk (e.g., by newts or water beetles) and lower prey availability for salamander larvae <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Weitere et al., 2018)</ref> . As an adaptation to these unfavorable living conditions, the larvae have a higher birth weight, develop a more pronounced gill system and metamorphose earlier than their relatives in streams <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Weitere et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Sabino-Pinto et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Caspers et al., 2015)</ref> . <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Oswald et al. (2020)</ref> showed a more pronounced shelter-seeking behavior for pond larvae and <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Krause et al. (2011)</ref> found larvae reared under poor nutritional conditions to also seek shelter more often than larvae reared under rich nutritional conditions.</p><p>In order to investigate the influence of these habitat-related characteristics on the feeding behavior, we perform standardized laboratory experiments in microcosms with both pond and stream larvae. These microcosms were filled with natural sediment, containing a whole benthic community and one salamander larvae was added. After one and two weeks, respectively, the composition, abundance and biomass of the benthic organisms were examined. The identical starting conditions enable us to optimally assess and compare the influence of the respective larvae.</p><p>Following our preregistration <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Ptatscheck et al., 2023)</ref> , we assumed that (1) fire salamander larvae reduce the abundance and biomass of benthic invertebrates in the experimental microcosms trough predation. However, (2) this top-down effect will be stronger in treatments with pond larvae because they are adapted to use the few available food resources more efficiently in order to be able to leave their temporary habitat as early as possible. Thus, (2a) they will consume even small organisms like nematodes, while (2b) their stream relatives will consume mainly larger oligochaetes. Additionally, we expected that (3) pond larvae will be less active while foraging, as they are less risk-prone and again, are able to use food resources more efficiently.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Organisms</head><p>The salamander larvae investigated in this experiment originate from populations that colonize headwater streams and temporal ponds (mostly water filled bomb craters) in the Kottenforst, a forest area southwest of Bonn (Germany, N 50°40'50.6748, E 7°7'23.1204). In the spring of 2023, we collected 25 stream and 23 pond larvae of approximately the same size (3.0 -3-5 cm body length) and took them to the lab for further examination. We collected larvae from two ponds (13 and 10 larvae) and two streams (13 and 12) to avoid any location specific effect (e.g. sibling effect). We were not able to find more larvae of the same size in the two ponds. Larvae that were physically impaired were excluded from this experiment. The larvae were kept individually in microcosms (see below) filled with stream water (from a different location, see below) at a water temperature of 15°C and a light cycle of 12:12 h for one week to acclimate to the laboratory conditions.</p><p>During this time, the larvae were not fed to achieve a higher trophic effect during the experiments.</p><p>Water, sediment and containing benthic organisms were collected from the Johannisbach, a second order headwater in Bielefeld (Germany). Furthermore, we transferred sediment and water to buckets, mixed and filtered the supernatant through a 10 µm sieve, and added the retained material to the sediment already collected (similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Wulfes et al., 2024 )</ref>. This increases the abundance of benthic organisms. We stored the collected material in a plastic box (60 x 40 cm floor area, 3 cm sediment height), covered with stream water, aerated by air stones and also acclimatized to the laboratory conditions for a week (see above).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study Design</head><p>Before the start of the experiment, the sediment was thoroughly homogenized in a single box. Then we filled the Plexiglas microcosms (10 x 10 x 6 cm) each with 1.5 cm of sediment, which in turn is covered with 3 cm of stream water. We placed one pond larva (LP) in each of the 20 microcosms and one stream larva (LS) in each of the other 20 microcosms (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). The other larvae (5 from streams and 3 from ponds) served as a reserve to compensate for any losses. We assigned the larvae within the treatment groups (LP, LS) randomly to the microcosms. 20 of the remaining microcosms did not contain larvae and served as control treatments (C).</p><p>After one week, we sampled 30 microcosms (10 per treatment + 10 controls).</p><p>Therefore, we placed the larvae, if any, back in their aquarium and transferred the sediment and water to 500 ml PE bottles. The remaining microcosms were treated in the same way after week two (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Once a group of larvae left the experiment, we transferred them back to their original habitat in the Kottenforst.</p><p>Before and after the experiment, we measured the total body length of each larvae and the gill filament length by using a camera and ImageJ. During the experiment, we also recorded the daytime movement of the larvae with video cameras that were installed above the microcosms. Due to technical difficulties, we could only analyse the records from daytime. We measured the time that the larva was active and inactive and the distance the larva traveled within its microcosm using the software AnimalTA <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Chiara &amp; Kim, 2023)</ref> Version 2.3.1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample processing and counting of organisms</head><p>We stained all samples with Rose Bengal and preserved them in 4% formaldehyde.</p><p>The benthic organisms were extracted from the sediment by centrifugation (LUDOX TM 50, 1.14 g ml -1 , mesh size 10 µm) as described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Pfannkuche &amp; Thiel (1988)</ref> and counted in gridded Petri dishes under a Leica S6E stereomicroscope at 45x magnification. Furthermore, we divided all macro-and meiobenthic organisms into taxon-specific size classes to calculate the respective biomass (dry weight)</p><p>according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Brüchner-Hüttemann et al., 2020)</ref> .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical analysis</head><p>We investigated differences in the benthos abundance, biomass and nematodes size classes of the treatments for the first and the second week using a Kruskal-Wallis test and if needed Kruskal MC as post hoc test. Likewise, we calculated differences in the biomass in the first and the second week. To test for differences between the sampling times, we calculated the percentage change in abundance or biomass and used a Mann-Whitney-U test.</p><p>For the analysis of the video data, we used a linear mixed effect model (LMM) with the R packages lme4 <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Bates et al., 2015)</ref> . First, we used the Shapiro Wilk test to test for normality and variance test to test for homogeneity of variance. In case normality of the data is not given, we used the bestNormalize package. We used proportion of time moving or average speed or distance travelled as the dependent variable, habitat type (pond, stream), size and week (week 1, week 2) as well as the interaction between week and habitat type as fixed factor and ID as random factor.</p><p>All tests were performed using R <ref type="bibr">(version 4.3.2, 2023-10-31)</ref>. We set the significance level to α=0.05.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>After week one, we counted on average 1118 metazoans (± 298, SD) in the control treatments, while the density was slightly lower at the end of week two (833 ± 309 ind.) (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref> &amp; 2c). However, with the exception of rotifers (which were less abundant in week two), we found no significant differences in the abundances of any identified taxon between the controls of week one and week two (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3b</ref>).</p><p>The total organismal biomass in the controls was 1002.6 µg (± 447µg, SD) and 1093 µg (± 695 µg, SD) (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref> &amp; 2d). Nematodes (65.3% and 73.9%) and rotifers (31.6% and 22.1%) predominated the benthic communities in the controls at both sampling times. Oligochaetes (1.9% and 2.7%) as well as chironomid larvae (&lt; 1% each) represented only a small fraction. In contrast, chironomids (42.2% and 37.2%), oligochaetes (30.8% and 38.3%), but also nematodes (25.5% and 20.3%), made up the major part of the organismal biomass at both sampling times, while the dry weight of the rotifers was low (&lt; 0.4% at both sampling times). A list of all collected organisms can be found in the supplementary information (Table <ref type="table">S1</ref> &amp;<ref type="table">S2</ref>).</p><p>Impact of fire salamander on the benthic community Already after week one, we observed a significant decrease in total abundance and biomass of benthic taxa in both larval treatments compared to the controls (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref> &amp; 2b). The abundance and biomass of benthic species in the treatments with stream larvae decreased significantly between weeks 1 and 2, while there was only a slight decrease after week 1 in both parameters in the microcosms with pond larvae <ref type="bibr">(Figure 2c &amp; 2d)</ref>. At the end of the two-week study, the reduction in abundance averaged 81.7% (± 6.8%, SD) in microcosms with stream larvae and 76.6% (± 13.4%, SD) in the presents of pond larvae. The total biomass decreased by 72.5% (± 14.3%, SD) and 49.7% (± 25.3%, SD). Overall, we found no significant difference in the total percentage decline of abundance or biomass between both treatments after two weeks (Tables <ref type="table">S1</ref> &amp;<ref type="table">S2</ref>). The temporal-and treatment-based effect varied between the taxa found, particularly in the nematodes, oligochaetes and rotifers (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>). Nematodes abundance in the treatments with pond larvae showed a significant difference from the control (p &lt; 0.05), resulting in a mean reduction of 61.4% (± 13.4%, SD) after the first week and an only slightly higher reduction of 77.3% (± 12.4%, SD) after week two (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a</ref>). In case of Nematodes exposed to stream larvae, there was only a significant (p &lt; 0.05) decrease in abundance after two weeks (mean reduction of 80.4% ± 13.4%, SD). The abundance of oligochaetes (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3c</ref>) was significantly lower than in the controls at both sampling times, but only in the treatments with stream larvae. Here, the mean abundance decreased by 57.2% (± 28.5%, SD) and 55.2% (± 12.4%, SD). In contrast to these results, rotifers (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3b</ref>) were similarly affected in both larval treatments. They showed significant lower abundances (p &lt; 0.05) after the first week with a mean reduction of 64.9% (± 23.2%, SD) in the presence of stream larvae and 65.3% (± 15.1%, SD) in microcosms with pond larvae. This effect was no longer detectable at the end of the experiment.</p><p>In connection with these abundance reductions, we did not observe any effects on specific size classes, such as the decline of large individuals. All size classes were reduced in proportion to their occurrence. Observed effects on the biomass of the different taxa are largely parallel to the described changes in abundance. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Larval body measurements and activity</head><p>While the body and gill filament length of the stream larvae didn't change during the course of the study, the size of the pond larvae increased slightly but significantly (p = 0.01) after 2 weeks by an average of 1 mm (± 0.08 mm, SD).</p><p>Additionally, we observed a significant (p = 0.01) reduction in the gill filament length of the pond larvae after just one week. The length of the gill filaments decreased by 1.2 mm (± 0.04 mm, SD). When analyzing the larval average speed, their traveled distance and the proportion of time moving, we found a significant interaction between the treatments and the sampling time. All three factors showed consistent values for both larval types after the first week (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>).</p><p>However, at the second sampling time all values were significant lower (p&lt;0.05)</p><p>for larvae from streams than from their pond equivalents. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Fire salamander larvae can exert a strong impact on meiofaunal and macrofaunal communities. According to our initial assumption (1) in treatments with larvae, the abundance and biomass of the benthic taxa was reduced within one week, especially those of nematodes, rotifers and oligochaetes. Another key finding is the different influence of the two larval types. Contrary to our initial assumption ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>), the overall effect on abundance and biomass was similar in both larval treatments.</p><p>However, in treatments with pond larvae, the abundance of meiofaunal nematodes and rotifers was significantly reduced, whereas stream larvae additionally affected the oligochaetes. Both findings are in line with our hypotheses 2a and 2b. Even though the videos do not show the larval feeding, as we filmed them from above, we assume a trophic interaction, as significantly fewer organisms were found in the sediment in the presence of the larvae compared to the controls. Another potential factor influencing the meiofauna could be chemical or physical effects (e.g., due to substances induced by the larvae, or mechanical disturbance of the sediment).</p><p>However, in such a scenario, we would expect to find more organismic residues such as body parts of oligochaetes or the cuticle of nematodes. Nevertheless, we will also discuss these factors below.</p><p>After just one week, the abundance of benthos in the 100 cm² test microcosms was reduced by over 50% by pond and stream larvae, with body sizes ranging from 3-3.5 cm. At the end of the 14-day study period, the decrease was over 75%. For comparison, <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Spieth et al. (2011)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Weber &amp; Traunspurger (2014)</ref> implemented laboratory experiments with juvenile carps and gudgeons and documented strong effects on the benthic communities. While carps of 9-12 cm body length reduced the abundance by 52% in 2 days, gudgeons (5-7 cm) had a similar effect after 24 h. Both species particularly influenced nematodes and oligochaetes, while unlike in our study, no effect on rotifers was documented. Even though they are consumed as food in aquaculture <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Fernández-Reiriz et al., 1993)</ref> , rotifers do not seem to be influenced by fish and macrobenthic taxa in sediment under natural conditions (reviewed by <ref type="bibr">Ptatscheck et al., 2020a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Ptatscheck, 2021 )</ref>. Therefore, our results, which show an effect at least after the first 7 days, are surprising. Rotifers have a short generation time compared to other benthic organisms, react quickly to environmental influences, and therefore generally exhibit strongly fluctuating population dynamics <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Ricci &amp; Balsamo, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Wallace, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Giere, 2009)</ref> . This is also evident in their reduced abundances in the control treatments after 2 weeks. Benthic rotifers and nematodes are typical endobenthic organisms rarely entering the water column. Limnic oligochaetes on the other hand, for example from the taxon tubificids, often protrude from the sediment and can serve as prey for visually hunting predators. The individuals we found in the experimental setups mostly had body lengths of over 3 mm, larger than the nematodes (mainly &lt; 1.25 mm) or the rotifers (&lt; 0.25 mm). In lotic waters, oligochaetes represent a significant portion of the food for a salamander larva, alongside various epibenthic organisms like gammarids <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Costa et al., 2017)</ref> . In temporary ponds, oligochaetes are rare and chironomids, terrestrial insects or residents of the water column like coleopterans and copepods dominates the larval diet <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Reinhardt et al., 2013)</ref> . Hence, stream larvae are probably already habituated to hunt on oligochaetes which explains the stream, but not pond effect in both weeks. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Hoover et al. (2024)</ref> already showed that learning behavior of fire salamander larvae affects their foraging strategy. Generally, hunting for prey mostly occurs near the bottom of the aquatic habitat (reviewed by Sánchez-Hernández, 2020 ).</p><p>The intake of endobenthic organisms requires that the sediment is stirred up and the prey is retained by morphologic structures or feeding behavior. The influences of such mechanical sediment reworking and trophic effects are often difficult to separate from each other. Salamander larvae are typically classified as lurking suction feeders <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Deban &amp; Wake, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Sanderson &amp; Kupferberg, 1999)</ref> , but more active hunting strategies were observed in the absence of light <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Hoover et al., 2024)</ref> . To the best of our knowledge, there are no studies documenting the process of sediment uptake. Although we were also unable to detect such behavior through the overhead camera footage, clear traces of mechanical deposits such as pits were visible. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Palmer (1988)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Schratzberger &amp; Warwick (1999)</ref> demonstrated that the mechanical disturbance caused by crabs or fish have a strong impact on meiofauna organisms. In both studies nematodes exhibit a particular sensitivity to the modification of the sediment structure. At the same time, the activity of larger organisms can also lead to the transfer of endobenthic organisms into the water column <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Wulfes et al., 2024)</ref> , potentially making them targets for predators. It has also been demonstrated in larval salamanders that certain macrobenthic taxa are more frequently found in the water column in their presence <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Oberrisser &amp; Waringer, 2011)</ref> . In this context, however, the effect of chemical interactions cannot be ruled out. Studies with newts have shown that the released neurotoxin tetrodotoxin decreases the mobility of benthic macroinvertebrates and affected predator-prey interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Gall et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Bucciarelli &amp; Kats, 2015)</ref> . Regarding fire salamanders, it is generally assumed that toxic alkaloids are mainly restricted to adults. However, these substances have also been detected in prometamorphosis stages and occasionally in young larvae (Reviewed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Lüddecke et al., 2018 )</ref>.</p><p>Gut analysis in previous studies clearly revealed that small endobenthic organisms &lt; 1 mm are ingested by salamander larvae <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Brophy, 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Brophy &amp; Pauley, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Trice et al., 2015)</ref> . Since the larvae we examined showed no signs of impending metamorphosis, we assume that their gill rakers were not yet regressed, allowing for the filtration of small prey organisms. The stronger development of gill filaments in the pond larvae may possibly lead to the assumption that the same applies to the remaining gill apparatus. This could be an explanation for the more pronounced decrease in nematodes in the first half of the study, when pond larvae were present. The unselective reduction across all size classes also suggests feeding through filtration. If the larvae were selectively and visually feeding, a stronger effect would have been expected on larger prey organisms. At the same time, the oligochaetes in the treatment with pond larvae were not significantly reduced, while the stream larvae themselves had a reducing impact on the nematodes from the second week of the study. Thus, our results cannot be solely explained by the morphology of the gill apparatus but rather by specific behavioral traits and preferences. As already mentioned above, oligochaetes are a primary food source for stream-dwelling salamander larvae. Therefore, it seems likely that this prey was reduced first before the much smaller and less rewarding nematodes were consumed from the stream larvae. Larvae from temporary ponds, on the other hand, are faced with a significantly lower food supply and rely on consuming all available prey. The consistent high activity of the pond larvae also is in line with such a foraging strategy. Our initial expectation (H3) of higher activity among the stream larvae was not confirmed. The sediment and water used in the study were sourced from a headwater stream and contained no chemical components from predators such as newts, which in ponds, are a reason for reduced activity in fire salamander larvae <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Hahn et al., 2023)</ref> . Unfortunately, our data cannot be used to determine whether activity was lower at night. At the end of the 14-day study period, the salamander larvae in both treatments reduced the biomass of the benthos to a similar extent. But we only found length growth in the larvae from the temporary ponds. These larvae may be able to utilize the consumed energy more effectively, which corresponds to their life strategy of starting metamorphosis early before the water dries up. Additionally, the gill lengths decreased, indicating a higher oxygen content in the experimental containers compared to the original habitats. Such restructuring of the gill structures within a few days has already been observed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bond (1960)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Segev et al. (2019)</ref> and perhaps allows the larvae to invest the degraded biomass in length growth.</p><p>Based on the assumption that small endobenthic organisms were not selective and visually hunted but that the gill apparatus plays an important role as a filter organ, further clarification (e.g., film records) of the feeding process is needed. Similar to bottom-feeding fish, water drawn into the mouth area of salamander larvae is pushed out through the gill slits, while food particles are retained in the gill apparatus. The number and size of gill rakers, and thus the mesh size of this gill net, can vary greatly among different fish species <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Spieth et al., 2011)</ref> .</p><p>Additionally, this filtering process is optimized by complex back-flushing of ingested particles, the morphology of the mouth area (e.g., the clamp-like bone structure and the muscular palatal organ) and numerous taste buds to detect suitable food <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Sibbing, 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Sibbing &amp; Nagelkerke, 2000)</ref> . Chemical food recognition also plays an important role in fire salamander larvae <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Hoover et al., 2024)</ref> . However, whether the filtering behavior of salamander larvae, with their relatively rigid jaw morphology <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Sanderson &amp; Kupferberg, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Deban &amp; Wake, 2000)</ref> , is as effective as in fish and even capable of retaining rotifers has not yet been investigated.</p><p>While the dietary spectrum of salamander larvae has already been described by numerous authors, our study shows the significant effect such predation can have on the benthic community, even on small meiofaunal organisms. Within just a few days, their abundances and biomass were greatly reduced. Due to adaptations to their habitat, this trophic impact differed between larvae from ponds and streams, as did their activity. Overall, larval feeding is still poorly understood, and an important subsequent step is to investigate the results of our microcosm study under field conditions and, for example, over the course of the year. Furthermore, for a more precise interpretation of our results, detailed information about the development of gill rakers in fire salamander larvae from ponds or streams would be crucial, which should be the aim of further studies.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Experimental design. 20 fire salamander larvae (Salamandra salamandra) from each habitat type (pond, stream) were placed into individual microcosms filled with sediment and benthic organisms.
