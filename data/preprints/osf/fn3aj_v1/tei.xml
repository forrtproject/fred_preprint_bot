<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Experiencing stressful life events has been associated with poor mental health outcomes, but less is known about daily stressful events' more proximate impacts on daily behavior and affect. Here we leverage mobile and wearable technology and recent advances in natural language processing for a fine-grained examination of first-year college students' daily life stress, with a focus on academic and social domains, over a full academic year (8,000+ total daily observations). Experiences of stress were characterized from participants' daily voice diaries narrating the main events of the day, using a combination of expert human labeling and large language models fine-tuned for sentiment analysis and topic modeling. Bayesian hierarchical models assessed within-person associations between diary-derived instances of academic and social stressful events and same-day sleep, physical activity, social activity, and negative affect measured with actigraphy wristbands and phone surveys. Days with academic stressful events were associated with shorter sleep duration, decreased physical activity, reduced desire to be around others, and modestly increased negative affect. Additionally, days with academic stressful events had significantly reduced social interaction and increased time spent on schoolwork relative to days with social stressful events. Meanwhile, days with social stressful events stood out by especially heightened negative affect, above and beyond the effect of academic stressful events. Our results suggest that academic and social dimensions of life stress may present distinct signatures in daily affect and behavior, with potential implications for longterm wellbeing.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The transition to college typically involves changes in multiple aspects of daily life. In addition to frequent class meetings and assessments, students must adapt to an unfamiliar social environment, develop new friendships, and manage their health and finances with increasing independence <ref type="bibr">(Ross, Biebling and Heckert, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr">Gerdes &amp; Mallinckrodt, 1994)</ref>. Although these are normative demands associated with college life, they can nevertheless contribute to the substantial rates of psychological distress and mental health disorders in this population <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Beiter et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Dyson &amp; Renk, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Ross et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Thorley, 2017)</ref>, with about one in three college students reporting experiencing serious psychological distress and a diagnosis of anxiety and/or depression (American College Health Association, 2023; <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Lipson et al., 2022)</ref>.</p><p>The impact of daily life stress on long-term wellbeing may vary depending on the domain of life stress. Although academic stressors are more common among students (American College Health Association, 2023), interpersonal stressors in daily life have been linked to greater rises in negative mood than other types of stressors like overload at work or the household <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Almeida, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bolger et al., 1989)</ref>. Relatedly, we recently reported that perceived interpersonal stress, although less frequent than perceived academic stress, was a more sensitive marker of students' longer-term psychological distress <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Vidal Bustamante et al., 2022)</ref>. More broadly, interpersonal stressors, such as family and peer conflict, have been presented as particularly important markers and antecedents of internalizing psychopathology, including among children, adolescents, and adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Brown &amp; Harris, 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">O'Neill et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Parker et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Rudolph et al., 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Rudolph et al., , 2016;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Whisman &amp; Beach, 2010)</ref>.</p><p>The effects of life stress on long-term wellbeing may be influenced by its more proximate impacts on affective states and behavioral routines <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Smyth et al., 2018</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Smyth et al., , 2013))</ref>.

Critically, the pattern and/or magnitude of the effects of daily life stress on affect and behavior may differ between academic and social domains of stress, which in turn may shape distinct longer-term impacts on wellbeing. However, methodological limitations have impeded a fine-grained, multidimensional examination of life stress. Diary methods have enabled the study of daily stressful events, but these studies have been typically short in duration, collapsed across different domains of life stress, and/or collected measures of negative affect but not other aspects of daily behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Almeida, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Charles et al., 2013)</ref>.</p><p>Recent advances in digital technology and natural language processing are enabling the characterization of daily life with unprecedent detail. Pen-and-paper diaries and checklists formerly used to record participants' daily life and stressful events <ref type="bibr">(Stone et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr">Tennen et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bolger et al., 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr">Bolger &amp; Eckenrode, 1991)</ref> can now be collected more effectively, efficiently, and at scale via smartphones <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Smyth et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Vidal Bustamante et al., 2022)</ref>, and recent advances in artificial intelligence applied to natural language processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Grootendorst, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Rosenthal et al., 2019)</ref> can help automate the analysis and classification of daily diaries' content. Additionally, wearable devices' sensing streams like accelerometer and GPS can seamlessly track sleep, physical activity, and mobility patterns as participants go through their daily lives <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Harari et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Sano et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Vidal Bustamante et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Wang et al., 2014)</ref>. Together, these tools are opening new opportunities for the study of life stress, its impacts on daily affect and behavior, and how these dynamics go on to shape long-term health and wellbeing.</p><p>In this paper, we leverage mobile and wearable technology and cutting-edge natural language processing techniques to conduct a deep phenotyping study of 49 first-year college students as they were naturally exposed to academic and social stressful events over a full academic year (10,000+ total daily observations). Our aims were twofold. First, we used daily voice diaries and a combination of large language models and expert human labeling to characterize students' experiences of stress across the year, as well as to identify the specific days when participants experienced academic and/or social stressful events. Second, we leveraged wearable-and smartphone-based metrics of students' sleep duration, physical activity, and self-reported affect, schoolwork, and social activities to examine whether days with academic stressful events and days with social stressful events were associated with changes in affect and behavior within individuals. We hypothesized that days with social stressful events would be associated with heightened levels of negative affect and less time spent socializing.</p><p>Moreover, we expected that days with academic stressful events would be associated with lower levels of negative affect relative to days with social events, shorter sleep duration, reduced physical activity, and more time spent on schoolwork.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method Participants</head><p>Forty-nine undergraduates beginning their first year of college volunteered for a yearlong study (46 were 18 years old and three 19 years old; 25 female and 24 male). Portions of the survey and actigraphy data from these participants have been previously reported by the authors in <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Vidal Bustamante et al., 2022</ref><ref type="bibr">, 2024)</ref>, but the voice diary data has not been previously reported. Relevant methods reported previously are repeated here. Students living on campus were recruited via flyers posted on campus boards and distributed via email lists and were enrolled in the pilot study during the first two weeks of their fall semester. Participants were required to be taking full-time classes and own a smartphone compatible with the study smartphone application, Beiwe, which is part of the open-source Beiwe platform for digital phenotyping <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Onnela et al., 2021)</ref>. Students were not excluded for current or past psychiatric disorders or medication use, nor if they began treatment or medication for mental health issues during the study. Interested participants scheduled an in-person consent session where study procedures were explained. Initially 68 participants enrolled in the year-long study, with 19 excluded based on issues with data acquisition: early withdrawal from the study (n=7), technical failure to acquire actigraphy data (n=1), poor quality actigraphy data (n=2), and completion of less than 100 of the daily surveys (n=9). Of the final sample (N=49), 63% identified as White, 14% Black, 10% Asian, 4% American Indian, and 4% Mixed-Race. Twelve percent reported prior diagnosis of a psychiatric disorder (including anxiety, depression, and/or ADHD); 8% maintained active diagnoses. 94% of the participants were iPhone users and 6% were Android users.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study Design</head><p>Informed consent was obtained from all participants and all study procedures and methods were approved by the Institutional Review Board of Harvard University. This intensive longitudinal observational study collected data over a full academic year extending a few days into the summer break. As originally described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Vidal Bustamante et al., 2022)</ref>, this study sought to acquire passive and active data as participants went through their daily lives.</p><p>Participants completed smartphone-based daily surveys and a voice-recorded diary, wore an actigraphy wristband for continuous activity and sleep monitoring for the duration of the study, completed a battery of online questionnaires at the beginning, middle, and end of the study, and attended brief in-person check-ins every 3-4 weeks. Participants were compensated $1 per each daily survey and $1 for each daily voice diary they submitted, $1 per day for continuously wearing the actigraphy wristband, and $20 per hour for online surveys and attending in-person visits. Milestone bonus payments for completing half of the study ($100) and the full study <ref type="bibr">($300)</ref> were also provided to reward participants' continued compliance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures and Quality Control</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Daily Phone-Based Surveys</head><p>Smartphone surveys were administered via the Beiwe application <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Onnela et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>Each night before bed participants completed a 46-item self-report survey related to their daily lives. Questions assessed a broad range of behaviors and internal states over the past 24 hours, including sleep quality, stress levels and sources, positive and negative affect, general physical health, daily consumption habits, studying behaviors, and sociability and support <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Vidal Bustamante et al., 2022)</ref>. Most questions were answered using a 5-point Likert scale. Here we report analyses of daily survey questions that assessed time spent on schoolwork, time spent interacting with others, desire to spend time with others, and negative affect. The full wording of the survey items is included in the Supplementary Materials. Time on Schoolwork. We used the survey item probing how much of a participant's awake time they spent on schoolwork, answered from 1 = "Very little of my time (0-20%)" to 5</p><p>= "Almost all of my time (81-100%)". Time Interacting. We used the survey item probing how much of a participant's awake time they spent interacting with others, answered from 1 = "Very little of my time (0-20%)" to 5</p><p>= "Almost all of my time (81-100%)".</p><p>Want Others. We used the survey item probing how much a participant wanted to be around others, answered from -5 = "Wanted to be completely alone" through 0 = "Neutral" to 5 = "Wanted to be completely with others".</p><p>Negative Affect. We aggregated individual survey items probing how sad, upset, hostile, irritable, and anxious participants felt that day, each answered from 1 = "Very little or not at all" to 5 = "Extremely", into a daily mean of negative affect.</p><p>Survey responses submitted between 5PM (local time) the day the survey opened and 6AM the following day were considered on time. Survey responses submitted past 6AM the day after the survey was prompted were discarded and deemed missing. A participant was included in analysis if they were compliant with at least 100 daily surveys across the data collection period, and only on-time surveys from those participants were included.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Daily Phone-Based Voice Diaries</head><p>Immediately after submitting the daily phone surveys each night, participants completed a daily voice diary via the Beiwe application. They were instructed to describe how they felt over the past 24 hours in relation to events that occurred and/or upcoming ones on their mind. As described in detail below, we used these diaries to identify specific instances of stressful events encountered by participants in daily life. Participants were asked to speak for at least one minute, and the recording automatically stopped after four minutes. To maintain privacy, participants were asked not to mention specific names of people or places, and they had the opportunity to review and re-record the voice diary before submitting. See Supplemental Materials for the written instructions provided to participants.</p><p>As with the daily phone-based surveys, voice diary entries submitted between 5PM (local time) the day the diary became available and 6AM the following day were considered on time.</p><p>Entries submitted past 6AM the day after the diary went live were discarded and deemed missing. Additionally, audio files flagged as having unusually low volume were manually reviewed, and any empty or inaudible files were deemed unusable. Diaries that passed these two filters (time of submission and audible content) were selected for transcription (N=8,020, or 76% of total possible diaries).</p><p>Transcription of the daily diaries was outsourced to TranscribeMe, a HIPAA compliant transcription service. Voice recordings selected for transcription were sent to TranscribeMe via secure file transfer protocols (SFTP). Transcribers were asked to transcribe the voice diaries verbatim (including filler words like "um") and to remove all personally identifying information and replace it with a "[redacted]" tag. Transcripts were shared back with us via SFTP. We spotchecked approximately 10% of the diary transcriptions for each participant against the original voice recordings. We only noticed a few instances where the transcriber had made a mistake, and in all instances, it was only one or two words that were misidentified; usually these were slang associated with college students (e.g., "PSAT" instead of "p-set", which refers to problem set, a common type of assignment in STEM classes) or terms and acronyms specific to this university (e.g., "session" instead of "section", or "path" instead of "PAF", or peer advising fellow). Any identified mistakes in the reviewed transcriptions were corrected during this spot-checking process, but we did not review nor correct any potential transcription errors in the rest of the dataset, as the small rate of errors was unlikely to cause major distortions in our downstream natural language processing analyses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Objective Sleep Duration and Waketime Activity via Actigraphy</head><p>Sleep duration and waketime activity were derived from the accelerometer data collected through the actigraphy wristband (GENEActiv Original, Activinsights Ltd., Kimbolton, UK) and analyzed via the Deep Phenotyping of Sleep (DPSleep) processing pipeline <ref type="bibr">(Rahimi-Eichi et al., 2021)</ref>. As originally described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Vidal Bustamante et al., 2022)</ref>, participants wore the wristband continuously on their nondominant wrist, including during sleep and when bathing.</p><p>Tri-axial acceleration was collected with a sampling frequency of 30 Hz during the academic semesters and 10 Hz during the winter break (in order to extend battery life and memory while participants were away from campus). We instructed participants to press the wristband's button when they began trying to fall sleep at night and immediately after they woke up in the morning.</p><p>When on campus, participants exchanged their wristband for a fully charged one with reset memory every few weeks as part of the scheduled check-ins with the study staff.</p><p>We applied the DPSleep processing pipeline to the raw actigraphy data to detect the major sleep episode of each day. Before any analysis, the pipeline used the minute-by-minute standard deviation of the tri-axial accelerometer data to identify and subsequently remove the minutes when the individual was not wearing the device. Then, the pipeline processed the remaining accelerometer data to produce minute-by-minute activity estimates. These estimates were computed by calculating the frequency spectrum of the accelerometer data across three axes. The intensity of the signal was represented by the area under the frequency spectrum curve for each minute. Thus, the activity estimate for each minute was quantified by the root mean square of the intensities from the three axes. Then, the pipeline estimated the major sleep episode based on a sliding window. Days where one of the boundaries of the sleep episode (i.e., rises in relative activity both before and after a period of lower activity) could not be detected due to missing data were labeled as unusable. Two trained independent raters examined the automatically detected start and end times and usability label of each sleep episode against the minute-based activity levels and the participant button presses when available. When necessary, they adjusted the automatic times and labels. A full description of the processing pipelines applied to the actigraphy data, including quality control steps, can be found in <ref type="bibr">(Rahimi-Eichi et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>All data that passed quality control was included in analysis, including days with no detected sleep episode (i.e., with no extended periods of lower relative activity). The following metrics were derived from the processed actigraphy data and used in the present analyses: Sleep Duration. Daily sleep duration reflects the number of minutes between the estimated start and end of the day's longest detected sleep episode. Sleep duration is assigned to the day when the sleep episode ended (i.e., the day when the participant woke up).</p><p>Waketime Activity. Daily waketime activity was obtained by averaging minute-based activity, calculated as explained above, across the full duration of the wake period (i.e., the period between two detected sleep episodes in consecutive days). If daily sleep episode data was missing, the waketime duration for that day and associated physical activity were deemed missing. Given that our operationalization of waketime activity using the minute-level area under the frequency spectrum curve can yield small numbers between zero and one, we multiplied all observations by 100 to make all downstream processing and analysis more tractable.</p></div>

A physical and mental health questionnaire asked participants to report whether they had past or current diagnoses of a series of conditions listed on a checklist (Supplementary Materials). We report these psychiatric diagnoses in our description of the study sample above.</p><p>Additionally, participants completed the Symptoms Checklist 90 Revised (SCL-90-R; <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Derogatis, 1975;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Derogatis &amp; Unger, 2010)</ref>, which we used for analyses.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Manual Rating of Daily Life Stressors using Voice Diary Transcripts</head><p>The transcripts of participants' daily voice diaries (N=8,020) were used to identify the occurrence of academic and social stressful events. The rating system was developed by two of the authors (CVB and RLB) and tested over a pilot sample of four first-year college students that each provided one semester of data (444 total diaries). The master rater (CVB) rated each of the pilot diaries. A team of four additional research assistants were trained on the rating system using this pilot dataset prior to applying the system to the target, fully independent year-long dataset. The present rating system was modeled after the UCLA Life Stress Interview (LSI; <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Hammen, 1988)</ref> and the Daily Inventory of Stressful Events (DISE; <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Almeida et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Almeida &amp; Horn, 2004)</ref>. Trained raters reviewed each transcript and indicated whether there was mention of a stressful event (binary 1/0) in the following life domain categories (adapted from those in the Life Stress Interview): academic (e.g., poor exam performance, heightened workload, struggling with an assignment due the next day), social (e.g., tensions or arguments with roommates, friends, romantic partner, family, or other; being rejected from joining a social club), and other (e.g., events related to health or finances). The "other" category was infrequent (&lt;2% of all diaries and &lt;1% between-subjects median) and excluded from the present analyses.</p><p>Per the LSI and the DISE's separation of stressful events from perceived stress, raters only marked specific stressful events that occurred on the day the diary was recorded; they did not mark instances where participants expressed an affective response in the absence of a concrete event, occurred that same day, that triggered those feelings. For example, mentioning receiving a bad grade that day was marked as a stressful event, but we did not mark mentions of general concerns about academic performance in the absence of a concrete event occurred that same day.</p><p>In addition to the life domain of the stressful event, raters noted the severity of the event.</p><p>Since we were interested in identifying events substantial enough to be potentially associated with significant changes in affect and behavior, raters were instructed to only mark events that were relatively moderate or severe, and to leave out mild hassles. The severity of a stressful event was assessed based on the relative impact of the event on an average college student's life (similar to the LSI), and inspired by DISE's definition of severity as "the degree and duration of disruption and/or unpleasantness created for the respondent" <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Almeida et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Almeida &amp; Horn, 2004)</ref>. Struggling with an assignment due the next day or receiving a bad grade on an assignment were considered moderate and severe examples of academic stressful events, respectively, as these have concrete consequences for a student's academic standing. Within social stressful events, interpersonal tensions were considered moderate, while arguments and romantic break-ups were considered severe. In contrast, merely having to do daily homework or study, or being inconvenienced by someone in passing were considered too mild to be included as stressful events. Across all participants, 4% of diaries contained a severe stressful event and 19% a moderate stressful event. We collapsed across these two categories (within academic and social domains) in our downstream data analyses for simplicity. The Supplementary Materials contain a description of the procedure used to train the raters and a written summary of instructions provided to them, including examples of academic and social stressful events. All raters showed 90% or higher accuracy in the rating of the pilot diaries before proceeding to scoring the target dataset. The team of four raters split the rating of the transcripts for the target sample roughly equally, and all transcripts from one participant were assigned in full to the same rater. To ensure inter-rater reliability and consistency in the scoring within and between participants' data, the master rater scored 36 diaries for every participant: the first 12 diaries, 12 roughly in the middle of the dataset ("middle 12"), and 12 toward the end of the year ("final 12"). The master rater set up raters with each participant's dataset by going over the first 12 diaries together. The rater then scored the first half of that participant's data independently in one sitting, followed by a review of the "middle 12" diaries with the master coder; any deviations from the master rater's answers were discussed. The same procedure was repeated with the "final 12" diaries after the raters completed scoring the second half of that participant's data.</p><p>Scoring a target participant's full dataset of diaries took on average three hours, including time spent debriefing with the master rater. All daily diary data were always kept in secure, password-protected, laboratory-owned computers throughout the scoring process, including during the training phase.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Natural Language Processing of Diary Transcripts: Sentiment Analysis and Topic Modeling</head><p>Transcript Preprocessing. The only preprocessing done to the daily diary transcripts prior to fitting the sentiment analysis and topic models described below was to remove sentence timestamps and the "[inaudible]" tags and question marks added by the transcribers next to words they were unsure about (e.g., "I really enjoyed watching the [game?] with my roommates" was modified to "I really enjoyed watching the game with my roommates"). This preprocessing was done in R 4.3.1 (R Core Team, 2023).</p><p>Sentiment Analysis. Sentiment analysis was used to determine the diaries' overall valence or sentiment (negative, positive, or neutral). We used a deep learning language model ('twitter-roberta-base-sentiment-latest') freely available on Hugging Face's website (https://huggingface.co/cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment-latest). This model uses a RoBERTa base architecture trained on over 120 million tweets <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Loureiro et al., 2022)</ref> that was further finetuned for sentiment analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Rosenthal et al., 2019)</ref>. We applied this model to our diary data to obtain automated scores (ranging from 0 to 1) for negative, positive, and neutral sentiment at the sentence level. We fit the model in Python 3.8.18 and subsequent processing was done in R 4.3.1 (R Core Team, 2023). We used the maximum of these three scores to categorize sentences as (mostly) negative, positive, or neutral in sentiment. Subsequently, we computed two transcript-level metrics: 1) we obtained the transcript-level percentages of sentences assigned to each of the three sentiment categories (e.g., a transcript could have 50% of sentences labeled as neutral, 25% as negative and 25% as positive); and 2) transcripts were categorized as (mostly) negative, positive, or neutral based on the sentiment label of the majority of the sentences in that transcript (e.g., using the previous example, that transcript would be categorized as neutral).</p><p>Topic Modeling. We identified frequent topics in our corpus of daily diaries via BERTopic v.0.15.0 (Grootendorst, 2022) using Python 3.8.18. BERTopic is a multi-layer algorithm that applies large language models and clustering techniques to create "topic representations" from text. Text was first transformed into numerical representations by using a word embeddings technique, the all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model from Hugging Face's sentencetransformers package v.2.2.2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Reimers &amp; Gurevych, 2019)</ref>. This technique projects text onto a 284-dimensional space based on the text's meaning; sentences that are close to each other in meaning are close to each other in this multidimensional space. The algorithm then reduces the dimensionality of these embeddings using a UMAP technique (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) with the umap-learn package v0.5.4 <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(McInnes et al., 2020)</ref>, which preserves both local and global structure of the text dataset and helps with the subsequent clustering of this space into semantically coherent topics <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(McInnes et al., 2020)</ref>. For the clustering step, we selected an HDBSCAN clustering algorithm (Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) due to its flexibility: it can find clusters (topics) based on the data distribution without making assumptions about the shape of the clusters and without requiring a predefined number of clusters, as well as allowing the assignment of text that does not clearly belong to any of the identified cluster to be assigned to an outlier or "junk" cluster <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Campello et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">McInnes et al., 2017)</ref>. The clustering was done with the hdbscan package v. <ref type="bibr">0.8.33 (McInnes et al., 2017)</ref>. Finally, BERTopic creates "topic representations" (i.e., interpretable representations of a cluster's meaning) by identifying the terms that are most representative of each topic using a cluster-level term frequency inverse document frequency (tfidf) matrix; words with high tf-idf scores are frequent in a cluster and infrequent across other clusters.</p><p>We applied BERTopic at the sentence-level, i.e., each sentence in each diary was assigned to one of the identified topics. In addition to the settings outlined above, we set up the model with a minimum cluster size of 100, i.e., the model was to identify topics with at least 100 representative sentences across our corpus of daily diaries. All other parameters in the HDBSCAN clustering algorithm were left in their default setting. Moreover, to leverage our prior knowledge of the content of the diaries and help with the identification of meaningful topics, we fit a semi-supervised version of BERTopic, which takes a suggested (not forced) list of topics to look for. We included a list of ten seed latent topics encompassing various domains of student life: schoolwork, people, self, health, finances, meals, sleep, exercise, housing, and extracurriculars. We exemplified each of the latent topics with four terms. For example, the following terms were used to represent the topic "schoolwork": "homework", "paper", "problem set", and "exam". For a "people" topic, the following terms were used: "friend", "girl", "guy", "parents".</p><p>Our BERTopic model identified 101 clusters or candidate topics (containing 91,251 sentences), in addition to the outlier or "junk cluster" containing all the sentences not assigned to any of the identified topics (34% of the sentences). We reviewed each cluster's representative words and sample sentences assigned to it to discern topic meaning and assign a topic label accordingly. Eight of the topics (mostly filler sentences, as explained below) were found to be redundant in meaning with other topics and were merged accordingly, resulting in a final set of 93 topics. A list of all 93 topics, their size, representative words, and sample sentences are presented in Supplementary Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>.</p><p>The ten topics we suggested to the model were identified by BERTopic, although at different levels of granularity. For example, for "schoolwork", separate topics were identified for each of the four terms used as examples, whereas only one topic was identified for "people", which gathered sentences mentioning the four example terms we had suggested. About 14% of the identified topics related to students' daily schedule, 14% to subjective feelings and assessments of their day, 10% academic and extracurricular activities, 10% social life, 8% health status, exercise, or sleep, and 3% other topics related to entertainment, grooming, chores, and financials. Additionally, 7% of the identified topics corresponded to filler sentences mentioned regularly by participants as they started and concluded their recordings and as they transitioned through different topics (e.g., "Hello voice recording", "What else happened today?", "OK, that's it.").</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Bayesian Hierarchical Linear Models Assessing Same-Day and Next-Day Associations Between Stressful Life Events and Behavioral and Affective Metrics</head><p>Bayesian hierarchical linear models assessed whether the daily behavioral and affective metrics of interest (sleep duration, waketime activity, time spent on schoolwork, time spent interacting, wanting to be around others, negative affect) on day t varied as a function of whether an academic and/or a social stressful event was reported the same day. Separate models were fit for each dependent variable (DV) of interest. Academic and social stressful event occurrences were added as two separate binary predictors (1/0). Given the large differences in demands experienced by students over winter break (a five-week period between semesters when school is not in session and most students are off campus) we decided a priori to exclude data collected over this break from all analyses. Moreover, given weekly fluctuations in the DVs within the semesters, day of the week was included as a covariate in our models. Random intercept and slopes for stressful events were added by participant, and the model assumed a normally distributed random error term. The regression model was specified as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">DV ~ Academic Stressful Event + Social Stressful Event + Day of Week + (1+Academic Stressful Event + Social Stressful Event | participant)</formula><p>While same-day effects were the primary focus, we also assessed whether the association between stressful events and the affective and behavioral metrics of interest would extend to the next day. To assess the association between today's affective and behavioral metrics and yesterday's stressful events, we used the same model as above, but lagged the stressful events by one day (i.e., on day t-1).</p><p>Note that sleep duration was the only tested DV that occurred at naturally lagged intervals relative to the stressful events (i.e., events only occurred during waketime). In the "same-day" analysis, we report the association between a stressful event and the duration of the sleep episode that ended the morning of the event (i.e., the sleep episode that preceded the stressful event), while in the "next-day" analysis, we report the association between a stressful event and the duration of the sleep episode that started later that night (i.e., the sleep episode that followed the stressful event).</p><p>Bayesian models were estimated in R 4.3.1 (R Core Team, 2023) using the Stan modeling language <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Stan Development Team, 2018)</ref> and the packages rstanarm v2.21.4 <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Goodrich et al., 2023)</ref>, tidybayes v3.0.1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Kay, 2021)</ref>, and bayestestR v0.13.1 <ref type="bibr">(Makowski, Ben-Shachar, &amp; Lüdecke, 2019)</ref>. All models were fit with a gaussian distribution. Posterior predictive checks indicated that the models with Likert-scale DVs (i.e., the survey items) may be better specified as ordinal regressions with a logit link function, but we opted for gaussian distributions across all models to facilitate comparison of effect estimates. Bayesian models were fit using MCMC with the default weakly informative priors from rstanarm (i.e., rescaled N(0, 2.5) priors for the slope parameters). For each parameter, we sampled from four stationary Markov chains, each comprising 5,000 sampling iterations, including a burn-in period of 2,500 iterations that were discarded, for a total of 10,000 post-warmup draws. Convergence of the four chains to a single stationary distribution was assessed quantitatively via the R-hat convergence diagnostic <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Gelman &amp; Rubin, 1992)</ref>, with adequate convergence defined as R-hat &lt; 1.1, and qualitatively by visual inspection of trace plots showing the estimated parameter as a function of each chain's iteration number, with adequate convergence defined as the chains overlapping with each other throughout and a lack of structured patterns in each chain. All models showed adequate convergence. We also report each model's Effective Sample Size (ESS), which generally should be at least 1,000 to obtain stable estimates <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Gelman et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Muth et al., 2018)</ref>, as was the case with all our models.</p><p>Point estimates of intercepts and slopes were computed as the median value of their respective posterior distributions. Ninety-five percent uncertainty intervals (UI) were computed as the 2.5% and 97.5% quantiles of the posterior distribution. To provide intuitive parallels to a frequentist inference framework, we interpreted a predictor slope as "statistically significant" if its 95% UI did not contain zero, or put differently, if the proportion of the posterior distribution falling in the direction (positive or negative) of the point estimate (also known as "probability of direction", or pd) was higher than 0.975, which approximates a frequentist one-tailed p-value &lt; 0.025 <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Makowski, Ben-Shachar, Chen, et al., 2019)</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Every night for a full academic year, participants submitted voice diaries narrating the main events of their day. Additionally, they submitted daily surveys and wore an actigraphy wristband throughout the study period. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> presents between-person summary statistics for the main variables used in analysis.</p><p>Participants provided a median of 184 usable voice diaries (range 70-221 out of a total possible of 223), and diaries were on average 1.60 minutes (256 words, 17 sentences) long.</p><p>Participants' total number of usable diaries was not correlated with their mean negative affect reported in daily surveys (r [median of posterior distribution] = .10, 95% UI = [-.36, .17], pd = .78), and participants' daily negative affect did not differ as a function of whether they submitted a voice diary that day or not (b [median of posterior distribution] = -0.02, 95% UI = [-0.10, 0.06], pd = .70). These observations suggest that participants' daily affective state was not systematically associated with whether they submitted a usable voice diary (more detail on available data by participant and data stream is included in Supplementary Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Content of Students' Daily Voice Diaries Fluctuated Along with the Academic Calendar</head><p>The content of the students' daily voice diaries fluctuated as expected with the main landmarks in the first-year student's academic calendar (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>), serving as a validation of participants' sustained compliance and our ability to capture real-world dynamics relevant to students' academic and social life.</p><p>A deep learning natural language processing algorithm identified common topics mentioned in the diaries across participants, four of which are highlighted in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> as a means to establish face validity. Mentions of "midterm exam" were most frequent in the weeks halfway through the Fall and Spring Semesters, when most university courses schedule midterm assignments and examinations. Meanwhile, mentions of "final exam" were most frequent during final exams period, the two weeks at the end of each semester when courses hold their final examinations, as well as during reading period, the week leading up to the final exams when no classes are held and students prepare for their exams. The fact that recall of these topics is observed not only in the fall but also in the spring semester demonstrates participants' continued compliance through the end of a full year of daily study participation. Moreover, mentions of both topics were nearly absent at other times in the year, demonstrating specificity in the mentions.</p><p>Another example of good recall and specificity in topic mentions comes from a special feature of first-year students' social life. On housing day, an annual university event held a couple of days before spring break, first-year students and their friends are assigned to one of the university's residential houses, where they will live for the remainder of their college years.</p><p>Weeks ahead of housing day, students must form a "blocking group" with the friends they wish to enter the housing lottery with. These groups are capped at eight, meaning that students must make collective decisions about who to include and exclude from their group. In line with these events, increased mentions of "blocking group" led up to housing day and mentions of "housing" spiked on housing day, while remaining close to zero the rest of the year.</p><p>Together, these patterns reinforce that the daily diaries captured real-world events and suggest that we are well positioned to study naturalistic instances of both academic and social stress in students' daily life. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Daily Diaries' Diverse Sentiment and Topics Revealed the Richness of Students' Daily Life</head><p>The daily voice diaries instructed participants to speak between one to four minutes about the main events of their day and how they felt about them but were otherwise unstructured. The wide variety of sentiment and topics expressed in the diaries demonstrates that participants felt comfortable sharing diverse aspects of their daily life, including both the good and the bad (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> for example sentences with neutral, positive, and negative sentiment for the topics highlighted in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</p><p>Students shared a mix of neutral, positive, and negative sentiment expressions in their daily diaries. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref> shows results of deep learning natural language processing algorithms applied to analyze the sentiment of the students' daily diaries. On average, most sentences within a diary were neutral (44%) or positive (36%) in sentiment (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>, left), e.g., descriptions of students' daily routines and expressions of classes and/or social interactions they enjoyed.</p><p>Although negative sentences (e.g., struggling with class material or social life, expressions of being sick or in a negative mood) were more rare, they represented a non-trivial amount of each diary's content (25%), with an average of one in every four sentences categorized as negative.</p><p>When categorizing sentiment at the diary level (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>, center), an average of 18% of each student's diaries had a majority of negative sentences, suggesting that almost one in every five days might have been especially challenging for participants. <ref type="figure"></ref>and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c</ref> present extended results from the topic modeling analyses described earlier (see Supplementary Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> for a list of all 93 identified topics, including sample sentences and frequency for each). Overall, the range, frequency, and sentiment of the identified topics reflect the nature of college life, including both the challenges and excitement associated with both academic and social experiences.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figures 2b</head><p>Students' daily diaries covered a wide range of topics, spanning daily routine, (I) students' subjective feelings and assessments of their day, (II) health status, exercise, and sleep, (III) academic and extracurricular activities, (IV) interpersonal relations and social activity, and (V) entertainment and daily chores (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>, top). Some of the most common topics mentioned by participants were "people", "schoolwork", and "stress", reinforcing again that the daily diaries captured core aspects of the student experience, including both social and academic domains of life stress. Topic mentions themselves varied in sentiment (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c</ref>), suggesting that the same topic could be mentioned in neutral, positive, or negative terms between participants as well as within participants over time. Topics like "sleep", "schoolwork", and "paper" were most often mentioned with a neutral sentiment (e.g., statements of their sleep schedule or spending time on an assignment), with roughly equal rates of negative and positive mentions (e.g., expressing dis/satisfaction with their sleep or progress made towards an assignment). As reflected by our "happy/unhappy" topic label, some of the topics related to participants' emotional states included sentences with either positive or negative references to that feeling. Other topics were more consistently associated with negative sentiment, such as "stress" and "health". Topics like "party" and "people" were most often mentioned with a positive or neutral sentiment, though the percentage of negative mentions was not trivial (41% and 19%, respectively), especially considering that "people" were mentioned in roughly half of a student's diaries.</p><p>The sentiment and topics discussed by participants showed expected regularities that reflected the weekday/weekend school schedule. Diaries tended to be less negative and more positive on Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>, right). Similarly, mentions of topics related to "schoolwork" and "stress" were least frequent on those days, while mentions of "people" and of "party" were most common on Fridays and Saturdays (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>, bottom).  "Um, I went to a party and it was just not fun and, like, kind of annoying just social space to be in, and I think that, like--I'm bringing that energy into the next day." "And the party was pretty cramped and kinda bad, honestly."</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic Stressful Events Were More Frequently Reported Than Social Stressful Events</head><p>A core goal of our study was to identify and characterize the occurrence of academic and social stressful events in students' daily life. A team of trained human raters went through each of the students' daily diaries and identified mention of academic and social stressful events that occurred the same day the diary was submitted. Note that this rating system was designed to only capture mentions of specific events, rather than mentions of perceived stress in the absence of a concrete event that occurred that same day, and only included events of moderate to high severity (e.g., receiving a bad grade, having an argument with someone), rather than also including mild hassles (e.g., having to do daily homework, being annoyed by someone's voice in the library).</p><p>On average, academic and/or social stressful events were identified in a median of 21% of a student's diaries, or approximately one in every five days. Academic stressful events were identified in a median of 12% of a student's diaries (i.e., at a rate of about once per week), while Social stressful events were identified in a median of 8% of a student's diaries (i.e., at a rate of about once every two weeks; Figure <ref type="figure">3a</ref>). A small fraction of diaries (0.6%) contained mentions of both academic and social stressful events. Academic stressful events were more common earlier in the week (when students are more likely to attend classes) and least likely on Fridays and Saturdays (Figure <ref type="figure">3b</ref>). Meanwhile, days with social stressful events did not follow the weekly school schedule as clearly.</p><p>Of note, the frequency of both academic and social stressful events varied substantially between individuals (Figure <ref type="figure">3a</ref>). For example, one participant reported social stressful events as infrequently as 0.5% of their 219 diaries, while another reported them as frequently as 29.4% of their 218 diaries, reflecting the diversity of the first-year college experience lived by different students.</p><p>Across participants, diaries were predominantly neutral in sentiment (~42% of sentences) regardless of whether a stressful event was mentioned, but diaries containing mention of either an academic or a social stressful event had a greater percentage of negative sentences (~33%)</p><p>and lower percentage of positive sentences (~28%) than diaries with neither type of event (23% and 38%, respectively; Figure <ref type="figure">3c</ref>). Of note, diaries containing academic or social stressful events were roughly equal in their percentage of negative sentences (~33%), suggesting that students</p><p>were not consistently speaking a greater number of negative sentences when describing instances of one or the other domain of life stress.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>. Academic stressful events were more frequently reported than social stressful events. a) Between-person percentage of daily diaries that contained mention of an academic or social stressful event, as identified by trained human raters.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Students' Behavior and Affect Showed Weekly Fluctuations Associated with the School Schedule</head><p>Ultimately, our study sought to examine how the experience of academic and social stressful events related to changes in students' daily behavior and affect captured through actigraphy wristbands and daily phone surveys. These behavioral and affective metrics showed weekly fluctuations associated with the school schedule (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4a</ref>). On Fridays and Saturdays, participants slept longer at night, were more physically active, and spent less time on schoolwork and more interacting with others compared to the rest of the week. These patterns reinforced our decision to account for systematic day-of-week behavioral fluctuations in our statistical models of the association between stressful events and students' daily affect and behavior.</p><p>Relatedly, there were intuitive patterns of within-person correlations among the daily metrics of behavior and affect (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4b</ref>). For example, on days when students spent more time on schoolwork, they also spent less time interacting and they were less physically active. On days when students reported wanting to spend their time around others they also spent more time interacting and reported feeling less negative affect. Additionally, self-reports of higher negative affect in the daily surveys correlated with higher negative sentiment scores in the language used by students in their daily voice diaries, suggesting that students were completing surveys and diaries conscientiously. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Daily Behavior and Affect</head><p>Bayesian hierarchical models estimated within-person changes in daily affective and behavioral metrics as a function of whether an academic stressful event and/or a social stressful event occurred that day (both binary predictors included within the same model), while controlling for day of the week (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref> and Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>).</p><p>Compared to days with no academic stressful events, days with these events were associated with shorter sleep duration, decreased waketime physical activity, reduced wanting to be around others, and increased negative affect. Academic stressful events were also associated with reduced social interaction and increased time spent on schoolwork, above and beyond days with social stressful events (non-overlapping UIs, highlighted with asterisks in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref>).</p><p>Days with social stressful events stood out by their association to heightened selfreported negative affect, above and beyond that associated with academic stressful events. Other than reduced time spent on schoolwork, we did not identify changes in sleep, physical, or social behavior as a function of whether a social stressful event occurred that day.</p><p>To explore the durability of these event-related associations, a separate set of models tested lagged associations between the occurrence of an academic and/or a social stressful event and the behavioral and affective metrics captured the following day (results shown in faded shading in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref>; Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>). We found the same overall pattern of results as the same-day models except that the magnitude of the effects was attenuated.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Psychopathology</head><p>Not all students experienced the same frequency of stressful events, but event-related rises in negative affect were shared across the sample. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6a</ref> highlights the time series of negative affect reported by four individual participants (P1-P4) across the academic year, while the occurrence of academic and social stressful events is denoted by the background color (red background indicates an academic stressful event, and blue indicates a social stressful event).</p><p>Although these four participants vary in the frequency of events, all show increases in negative affect on days with a social stressful event.</p><p>Frequent occurrence of social stressful events was associated with higher symptoms of psychopathology, reported at baseline and at the end of each semester through a clinical questionnaire assessing global clinical symptoms tied to psychological distress. P1 and P2, who had infrequent social stressful events, scored low on global clinical symptoms, while P3 and P4, who had frequent social stressful events, scored high on global clinical symptoms (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6b</ref>).</p><p>In line with these observations, an exploratory between-participants linear regression model including the full sample of participants found that the frequency of social stressful events (b [median of posterior distribution] = 49.69, 95% UI = [13.97, 84.27], pd = 1), but not the frequency of academic stressful events (b [median of posterior distribution] = 25.98, 95% UI = [-14.74, 67.27], pd = .90), was associated with higher global clinical symptoms.</p><p>Additional exploratory correlations leveraging the sentiment of the language used by students in their daily diaries revealed similar patterns of results (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6d</ref>). Students that had a higher proportion of mentions of other "people" using negative sentiment language had higher global clinical symptoms (r [median of posterior distribution] = .51, 95% UI = [.25, .68], pd = 1).</p><p>We did not find a correlation between the proportion of negative mentions of "schoolwork" and global clinical symptoms (r [median of posterior distribution] = .15, 95% UI = [-.12, .40], pd = .87).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Stress has been consistently linked to poor mental health outcomes, but less is known about the more proximate (day to day) impacts of daily life stress. The current study collected actigraphy data, daily surveys, and daily voice diaries continuously over an academic year to examine first-year students' experiences of academic and social stressors and their association to affect and behavior. Group-level models assessing within-person associations found that days with academic stressful events were characterized by shorter sleep duration, reduced physical activity and social interaction, increased time spent on schoolwork and modest increases in negative affect. Meanwhile, days with social stressful events stood out by their association to especially heightened negative affect, above and beyond the effect of academic stressful events.</p><p>Together, these results echo and extend prior research on daily life stress in multiple ways.</p><p>While researchers began studying individuals' daily life stress decades ago via pen-andpaper diaries <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bolger et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Tennen et al., 1991)</ref>, our work demonstrates that recent technological and analytical advances have enabled the characterization of daily life with unprecedented granularity and over extended periods of continuous examination <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Vidal Bustamante et al., 2022)</ref>. Cutting-edge natural language processing techniques helped unveil and quantify the wide range of topics and sentiment shared by students in their daily voice diaries, suggesting that participants were comfortable sharing both positive and negative aspects of their daily life, and reinforcing the suitability of our intensive longitudinal data for the investigation of academic and social stressors in the real world.</p><p>Most critically, we build on prior literature by directly assessing multiple behavioral and affective markers of different domains of life stress within individuals. The different patterns of effects identified for academic and social stressful events may be related to academic stress being more common and structured than social stress, as reflected by its higher frequency rates and systematic weekly patterns observed in Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>. When workload increases and an important assignment is due, a common response is to devote time to that task, sometimes at the expense of social interaction, physical activity, and even sleep. In contrast, social stressful events like interpersonal conflicts are not task-like; they have less of a concrete, intuitive strategy to deal with the situation in the immediate term. In this case, behavioral responses are likely to be more idiosyncratic to the situation and context, as well as to the individual and their preferred coping strategies <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(DeLongis &amp; Holtzman, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Folkman &amp; Moskowitz, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Lee-Baggley et al., 2005)</ref>. This heterogeneity would make it more unlikely to find stable, group-level behavioral effects associated to social stressful events.</p><p>Nevertheless, days with social stressful events stood out by their heightened negative affect (the largest effect size detected across models), above and beyond the effect of academic stressful events. Social stressful events were also accompanied by reduced time spent on schoolwork, perhaps reflecting general disruptions in students' ability or desire to concentrate on work. This might reflect that social stressful events are perceived as more personally meaningful and uniquely challenging than academic stressful events, especially for students undergoing the transition to college and its associated restructuring of social relationships and networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Paul &amp; Brier, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Rose, 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Swenson et al., 2008)</ref>.</p><p>Although an elevation in feelings of sadness and anxiety appear to be a normative proximate response following interpersonal stressful events, repeated interpersonal tensions and conflict may be a marker of more enduring symptoms of psychological distress. Exploratory correlational analyses found that participants who reported a higher rate of social stressful events, as well as those with a higher proportion of negative mentions of other people in their daily diaries, also scored higher on a clinical inventory of global symptoms of psychopathology.</p><p>These results do not establish causality, and it is possible that students with higher baseline symptoms of psychopathology are more likely to encounter social conflict due to their already elevated negative affect <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Daley et al., 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Hammen, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">McLaughlin &amp; Nolen-Hoeksema, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Rudolph et al., 2009)</ref>. Further longitudinal research should evaluate the prospective role of daily social stressful event exposure in the emergence and progression of longer-term symptoms of psychopathology, including whether this role differs significantly from the contributions of other forms of life stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Brown &amp; Harris, 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">O'Neill et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Parker et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Rudolph et al., 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Rudolph et al., , 2016;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Whisman &amp; Beach, 2010)</ref>.</p><p>The present results should be considered in light of their methodological limitations.</p><p>First, our "academic" and "social" life stress categories require further refinement in future research, including at the individual level. For example, although both pertaining to the academic life domain, heightened workload associated with preparing for an exam and receiving a bad grade are likely to elicit different sets of behaviors and affective responses. Moreover, a strict separation between academic and social domains might be difficult in some cases; e.g., getting a bad grade could be argued to have social significance, as it involves an evaluation of the student's performance by someone else and might trigger peer comparisons. Relatedly, additional features of a stressful event might be more indicative of the event's potential impact on students' behavior and wellbeing. For example, stress researchers have referred to different "domains of threat" to characterize a stressful event's subjective meaning to an individual, including "loss", "danger", and "disappointment" <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Almeida &amp; Horn, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Lazarus &amp; Folkman, 1984)</ref>. Future research could use similar categorizations, in conjunction with life domain, to provide a finer-grained characterization of the features of stressful events that might be most closely related to their impact on behavior, affect, and mental health outcomes.</p><p>Second, our identification of daily stressful events relied on participants' self-recorded daily voice diaries, but we had missing data and participants may have left out important information relevant to our analyses. All participants shared at least some instances of both academic and social stressful events, but it is possible that participants did not always provide a comprehensive account. Third, our naturalistic intensive longitudinal design lends ecological validity to the examination of life stress, but our study was observational and our models testing the associations among stress, affect, and behavior did not ascertain causality. Finally, although we tested both same-day and next-day effects, we did not assess the possibility of nonlinear or cumulative effects of daily stressful events over time.</p></div>

Therefore, we will score all of a participant's diaries close in time so you remember what is typical/unusual for each subject.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Consult the repository of examples/notes when uncertain</head><p>• Sometimes you might be unsure about how to score some of the diaries. Please consult these notes and examples of stressful events at the end of this document frequently and every time you are unsure about whether/how to score a particular segment of the diary. • Sometimes you might be unsure whether a certain event belongs in the Academic or Social life domain. For example, a participant might mention a tense interaction with classmates during class. In such cases, focus on the specific source of stress. In the earlier example, it is the interaction that is stressful, so it would belong to the Social domain. If the source of stress is mostly related to the participant's academic performance, then it would belong to the Academic domain.</p><p>• If after consulting these notes you are still unsure about how to score a diary, leave a note about it under the "Notes" column of that participant's spreadsheet and make sure to check with the master rater during the mid-point and final check-ins.</p></div>

That said, if there is a specific event that triggered the thoughts/feelings, think if that event itself could be considered under one of the event categories in the system. • Do mark as event the day it was mentioned if:</p><p>o The participant mentions making plans today for an exciting event in the future o The participant mentions heightened workload today related to preparing for event in the future (e.g., working long hours on a submission due the next day) o In the two cases above, the acts of planning/preparing are themselves events that we are noting </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.

Please complete your daily voice recording directly after completing the survey questions.</p><p>2. Please describe how you felt over the last 24 hours in relation to events that have occurred as well as to upcoming events either specific or general that are on your mind. 3. Please speak for at least 1 minute (but it will automatically stop after 4 minutes). 4. Please do talk about important people and events that might be encountered or have been encountered, but avoid specific details that could identify those people or locations. For example, you could say "I was feeling lonely because I spent all day in my dorm" or "I was in a good mood because I'm excited about a nice restaurant I'm going to tomorrow," but please don't say "I'm excited about going to Union Oyster House tomorrow" or "I spent all day in the Lowell House dorm." It would be fine to say "I've been feeling anxious about seeing a family member that I tend to fight with during the holidays," but not "I've been feeling anxious about seeing my brother Tom this coming holiday." 5. Give a good sense of how you've been feeling that day and why and about specific upcoming events that are on your mind: if you're nervous about an upcoming assignment, got into a fight with someone, excited about good things that have happened or that you're looking forward to. For instance, some things you could talk about would be (but not limited to): a. Who you interact with today (remember, no names)? How close were these people to you (closest friends, acquaintances, etc.)? How do you feel the interactions went? b. Did you feel particularly accepted, rejected or emotionally supported and why? c. What were the highs and lows of your day? Did anything particularly notable happen, and how did it make you feel? d. What were the things that made you particularly stressed? Relaxed? Happy? Sad?</p><p>How did you deal with them? 6. When you are ready, press the "Done" button, which will submit your recording.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Supplementary Methods: Health Questionnaire</head><p>Please specify which of the following conditions you have now or have had in the past. Training the team of raters involved three stages. First, the master rater went over each of the diaries for one of the pilot participants and explained to the raters the correct way to score each diary. Secondly, for an additional two pilot participants' data, the master rater went over the first fifteen diaries together with the raters, and raters were then asked to score that participant's remaining diaries by themselves, one third of diaries at a time. After they were done with one third, the master rater went over each of the diaries together with the rater and any discrepancies were discussed and corrected to match the master rater's answer. The same procedure was repeated for the remaining two thirds of that participant's data, and then the process was repeated for another pilot participant. Lastly, for the final pilot participant, the master rater went over the first fifteen diaries together with the rater, and then the rater scored all remaining diaries by themselves. The master rater then computed the overall accuracy of each rater's answers (compared to the master rater's answers); if the accuracy was 90% or higher, the rater was deemed ready for the independent scoring of target participants' data. All four raters passed this bar (and all incorrect answers were discussed).</p></div>
