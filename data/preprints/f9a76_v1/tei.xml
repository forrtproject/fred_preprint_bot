<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Can we Boost Intensive Depolarization Events Using Light Touch Interventions?</head><p>People are less likely to like people they disagree with <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Byrne, 1969)</ref>, an effect so consistent some have called it a psychological law <ref type="bibr">(Byrne &amp; Griffitt, 1968)</ref>. When a person or group is perceived to hold different political views, people express animosity towards that group and are more likely to discriminate against that group (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Brandt &amp; Crawford, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Crawford et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Gift &amp; Gift, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Whitt et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Woitzel &amp; Koch, 2023)</ref>. In this way, disagreements can degrade the social fabric of our communities. Community members and scholars are both interested in how to reduce the social fraying caused by disagreement <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Hartman et al., 2022)</ref>. It could have both practical benefits (more social cohesion) and theoretical insight (how to alter a psychological "law"). Here we examine how stacking a light touch video intervention on a more intensive in-person, conversationbased intervention can boost the effectiveness of the intensive intervention. We do this within the context of the Respectful Conversations program run by the Minnesota Council of Churches (hereafter MCC Respectful Conversations).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Approaches to Interventions</head><p>Scholars have identified a number of factors that might be used to reduce the negative interpersonal consequences of disagreement <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Hartman et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Voelkel et al., 2024)</ref>. For example, imagining being included by people on the other side <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Voelkel et al., 2021)</ref>, receiving misperception corrections <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Ahler &amp; Sood, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Mernyk et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Moore-Berg et al., 2020)</ref>, writing a brief paragraph about what one likes about America <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Levendusky, 2018)</ref>, and reading about warm interactions between opposing political elites <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Huddy &amp; Yair, 2021)</ref> all have been found to reduce political animosity. The typical approach across many of these efforts is to use tightly controlled lab or survey experiments with diverse, if not representative samples of participants (for a study including many such interventions, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Voelkel et al., 2024)</ref>. These choices help maximize internal validity, but simultaneously constrain the types of studies that are conducted. For example, conducting a survey experiment on a representative sample requires that the intervention is short and easily presented in the survey context (often in an online questionnaire). Such designs can identify causal effects to inform psychological theory, but it is not clear that these designs' effects are durable (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Dias et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Holliday et al, 2025)</ref>. Indeed, a meta-analysis of the prejudice reduction literature suggests that most of our methods produce weak effects that are unlikely to last <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Paluck et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>At the same time, a growing number of civic-minded organizations interested in reducing polarization and bridging political (and related) differences have developed programs to do just this. The precise goals and methods of the bridging community differ depending on the specific organization, but in many cases these practitioners are developing programs aimed at helping people connect across differences. For example, the organization Braver Angels developed Red/Blue workshops. These workshops aim to integrate information about the policies and perspectives of political outgroups with empathy building in a full-day event including structured and moderated exercises and discussions. Essential Partners, formerly the Public Conversations Project, developed reflective structured dialogue in the early 1990s. It is a model of empathy-building across divides in deeply-held values using participant engagement based on family therapy practices. There is some recent work testing these approaches. For example, an experimental evaluation of Braver Angels Red/Blue workshops found that the program reduced animosity among college students <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Baron et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>We now have multiple methods, from both scholars and practitioners, that potentially reduce animosity. A challenge is how to best integrate the findings from scholars that test less intensive interventions, with the more intensive programs developed by practitioners. One strategy already in use is to take the theoretical principle from the scholarly work and embed it into the program. For example Red/Blue workshops noted above takes social psychology work on empathy <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Batson &amp; Ahmad, 2009)</ref> and embeds it into their program <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Baron et al., 2021)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Intervention Stacking</head><p>In this project, we are testing an additional strategy that we call intervention stacking (see Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). This strategy pairs an existing and typically more intensive intervention with a boosting intervention that is typically less intensive, with roots in the research literature. This is different from the approach described in the prior paragraph because the boosting intervention is not fully integrated into the existing intervention and is instead deployed in a very similar way as it was used in the scholarly literature. If this strategy is successful, it would provide an easy method for practitioners to improve on their programs using methods from the scholarly literature. In other words, by stacking the interventions, the less intensive intervention may be an easy method to improve the outcomes of the more intensive intervention.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 1. Intervention stack in the general case and in our study</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Existing Intervention</head><p>The existing intervention that we will use in this project is the MCC Respectful Conversations program. MCC Respectful Conversations are facilitated, structured dialogue events designed to produce empathy across divides, strengthen community relationships, decrease polarization and increase peacebuilding capacity among participants.</p><p>For conflicts where community relationships are highly valued, MCC Respectful Conversations are designed in partnership with stakeholders of multiple perspectives to discern a specific framing topic (e.g., "The Election", "Bridging Cultural Differences"). Following the discernment, volunteers from a host community are trained by a Lead Facilitator to be Table <ref type="table">Facilitators</ref>. They learn the structure of the dialogue, they experience it as participants, and they gain skills in reframing statements and gotcha-style questions into questions of genuine interest focused on narrative-sharing.</p><p>At a MCC Respectful Conversation event, the Lead Facilitator and now-trained Table Facilitators lead a large community group through a dialogue process. The process begins with a meal and content about conflict and behavioral guidelines is delivered to the group as a whole, as well as specific small groups at tables. After this, within the small groups at tables, people take turns going around the table and share their perspective on the topic, as well as asking and responding to questions. Then there is a sort of conversational freefor-all about the topic, followed by another round of reflection on the experience. The event ends with a closing response round as a large group and evaluations.</p><p>Across the event, the structure and content is designed to increase awareness of and slow down the experience of the body's physiological response to threat when it is confronted by ideas that challenge worldview. By using tools like silence, structured questions, and joyful animation participants are more able to be fully present with each other. Questions posed are designed to evoke personal narrative, values sharing, and emotional revelation in way that moves the discussion away from a binary right/wrong topic area into one where participants experience more curiosity about each other. In combination, MCC Respectful Conversations are designed to strengthen democracy by fortifying our communities through enhanced relationships that result from higher-quality conversation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Boosting Intervention</head><p>To identify a boosting intervention, we reviewed the interventions tested as part of the Strengthening Democracy Challenge <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Voelkel et al., 2024)</ref>. This project solicited potential interventions that could be used in a survey experiment to decrease political animosity and increase support for democratic norms. Based on our discussions, we chose a short, seven-minute video intervention that stresses the importance of individual stories (called "sympathetic personal narratives" in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Voelkel et al., 2024)</ref> developed by the organization Civity <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Kopell, Strand, Baleria, &amp; Fiorella, 2024)</ref>. In the videos, individuals talk about themselves and their experiences, often complicating the viewers ideas about the people based on their surface-level characteristics. Following these, participants then watch a video that discusses the value of connecting with people who are different and seeing them as members of their community. The focus of this intervention pairs well with the focus and philosophy of MCC Respectful Conversations, making it a good match. Moreover, this intervention was the fourth most effective intervention at reducing political animosity in the Strengthening Democracy Challenge (like most interventions, it did not significantly affect undemocratic practices and political violence, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Voelkel et al., 2024)</ref>.</p><p>In our stacked intervention, participants are asked to watch the sympathetic personal narratives videos before attending the MCC Respectful Conversation event. Our idea is that these videos can start to open people up to the idea of learning from the people they disagree with. This initial openness then primes people to have an open mind when attending the full event and, hopefully, helping to increase the effectiveness of the event. If this is successful, it would suggest that adding just a 7 minute boosting intervention can help improve the existing 150-180 minute long MCC Respectful Conversation program.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Current Experiment</head><p>The purpose of our experiment is to test if a combined treatment of the sympathetic personal narratives video intervention and the MCC Respectful Conversation event increases people's openness to those they disagree with compared to only participating in a MCC Respectful Conversation event. We use an experimental pre-test-post-test design and a series of MCC Respectful Conversation events for several different communities. We examined the effect of these interventions on a variety of outcomes representing openness and acceptance of people with different attitudes and opinions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants and Events</head><p>The research question, hypotheses, study design, and analyses were preregistered. All participants were people who volunteered to attend one of Minnesota Council of Churches' Respectful Conversations events starting in October 2023. The date, topic, and sample size for all of the events are in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. To maintain the integrity of the MCC Respectful Conversation program, demographic data was not collected. However, an informal estimate from people who attended the events describe the samples as primarily White and an even mix of men and women. The events themselves were held for a range of communities, including municipality, school district, church, and university communities.</p><p>The original preregistration (Preregistration 1, submitted 13 October 2023) said we would collect data until the end of August 2024. Because some events were rescheduled, the preregistration was updated (Preregistration 2, submitted 15 August 2024) to extend our deadline until the 2024 November elections. An additional reschedule pushed back the event until 12 November 2024 and so we submitted a third update (Preregistration 3, submitted 13 October 2024) specifying this as our end date. During the final wave of MCC Respectful Conversation events that occurred in November 2024, there were two additional events after our 12 November 2024 cutoff for which we have data. For the analyses below, we show all results for each possible preregistration, as well as for all of the data (i.e. with the additional events after the 12 November cutoff). The events included in each preregistered inclusion criteria are noted in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. Finally, one additional event was not included in the analyses because of an error in the distribution of the materials. Note: Events sharing superscript a were part of Preregistration 1's inclusive criteria. Events sharing superscript a and b were part of Preregistration 2's inclusive criteria. Events sharing superscript a , b , and c were part of Preregistration 3's inclusive criteria.</p><p>Events without any superscript were not part of any preregistrations inclusive criteria.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Design</head><p>We used a pre-post experimental design (see Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> for a summary; for benefits of this design, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Clifford et al., 2021)</ref>. After signing up for the event and in the 2-3 days before the event, participants received emails inviting them to complete a pre-event survey to help MCC Respectful Conversations evaluate their program and to help prepare the participant for the event. The survey included our key measures (see below), as well as questions to create anonymized codes to link participants with their post-test data.</p><p>After the questions, participants were randomly assigned to the intervention condition. This is the sympathetic personal narrative intervention from Voelkel and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Voelkel et al., 2024)</ref> developed by Civity <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Kopell et al., 2024)</ref>. Participants watched five short videos of people talking about what others may miss about them. Participants then watched another animated video about how democracy allows people with different views to work together. Our only modification of the original implementation is that we removed explicit mentions of politics in the text introduction to these videos because MCC Respectful Conversation events are not always about politics. We chose the Civity intervention because it was possible to implement into a MCC Respectful Conversation event and it has been shown to reduce partisan animosity <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Voelkel et al., 2024)</ref>. Participants randomly assigned to the control condition did not watch any videos and proceeded to the end of the questionnaire.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 2. Summary of study design</head><p>Participants then attended their MCC Respectful Conversation event. At the event, they participated in the typical MCC Respectful Conversation process (summarized in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>). At the end of the event, participants were encouraged to fill out the post-event questionnaire, which included our key measures and questions to create anonymized codes to link with the pre-test measures. We also sent them a reminder email the day after the event to encourage more responses. The response rates for each event and in total are in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures</head><p>We had several sets of key measures that we measured at both the pre-test and post-test to assess the effectiveness of MCC Respectful Conversations and the experimental treatment (see Table <ref type="table">3</ref>). All measures are coded so that higher scores indicate more openness to people and ideas that differ from the participants' own point of view. All measures are rescaled to range from 0 to 1. Correlations between all of the scales are in the supplemental materials.</p><p>Our key measures came from two sources. First, we adopted and adapted items from the Social Cohesion Impact Measure (SCIM; Bridging Movements Goals &amp; Measures Program, 2024), a measure designed to measure the impact of depolarization initiatives. This measure was developed in consultation with both practitioners and academics and includes multiple measures from the research literature (e.g., feeling thermometers, social distance measures). The SCIM assesses several outcomes related to polarization and we include those assessing liking of the outgroup (liking scale, items 1 and 2), morality (item 3), and respect (item 4). We also adapted items from previous evaluations of MCC Respectful Conversations that assess confidence in discussing difficult issues (items 5 and 6) and empathy (items 7 and 8).<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> As preregistered, we created 4 two-item scales from these items (all between item r's &gt; .50, all test-retest reliability r's ≥ .50, see Table <ref type="table">3</ref>) and include item level analyses in the supplemental materials. Table <ref type="table">3</ref>. Scale items (1 st column), correlations/alphas for items used in the scales (2 nd and 3 rd column), as well as the correlation between the pre-and post-test measurements of all scales and items (4 th column). .52</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Scales/Items</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Item</head><p>As part of preregistered secondary analyses, we included three items from a moral humility measure that is being developed in the first author's lab <ref type="bibr">(items 9, 10, and 11;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Vallabha &amp; Brandt, 2024)</ref>. These items come from different subscales intending to asses Moral Learning/Openness (item 9), Moral Fallibility (item 10), and Moral Superiority (item 11). We analyze these as scales in the main text and include item level analyses in the supplemental materials (α and test-retest reliability r's in Table <ref type="table">3</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pre-Post Effect of MCC Respectful Conversations (Exploratory)</head><p>We first analyzed if there was evidence that MCC Respectful Conversation events depolarized participants. These analyses were not preregistered and so should be considered exploratory. Nonetheless, we think it is important to understand the trajectory of people's attitudes over the course of the events. To test this, we calculated the difference between the pre-test and post-test measures for each participant. Because participants were recruited from different events, we adjusted for these events using OLS regression. We regressed the difference score on a series of event contrast codes using a simple coding scheme. The intercept in a simple coding scheme corresponds to the mean of event means (see UCLA: Statistical Consulting Group, 2024). The significance of the intercept tells us if there was significant change over the course of the event. We repeated this analysis for all scales and items. We also repeated it for each of our preregistered inclusion criteria, as well as for all of the data. Across all of the scales, we see that people became less polarized following the MCC Respectful Conversation events (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>). This was also the case for the individual items (with exceptions for two of the moral humility items, see supplemental materials). As is evident in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref> (right panel), the effects were largest for the empathy and confidence scales, with both increasing by between 15% and 18% of the scale range depending on the inclusion criteria. The smallest changes were for the moral humility scale with increases ranging from 6% to 7% of the scale range depending on the inclusion criteria. Based on these analyses, it appears that MCC Respectful Conversation events work (see Discussion for the limitations of this single-group pre-post design). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Treatment Effect of Boosting Intervention (Confirmatory)</head><p>We tested our preregistered experimental hypothesis across each of the scales using OLS regression. We regressed the post-test measure on the boosting treatment condition (0 = control, 1 = treatment) and the pre-test measure to estimate the treatment effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Clifford et al., 2021)</ref>. Because participants were recruited from different events, we preregistered that we would include a fixed-effect for event as a series of dummy codes. Instead of using dummy codes, we used the simple coding scheme described above. Across all analyses, there was one statistically significant result (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref>). When using the inclusion criteria from Preregistration 2, there was a significant (p = .03) effect of the boosting treatment, indicating that the treatment increased liking by 5% of the scale range. The effect on liking using the Preregistration 1 inclusion criteria was nearly identical in size, but with a larger standard error making it non-significant (p = .07). The boosting treatment effects using the other inclusion criteria, which all included data from after the election, were smaller in size and non-significant (p's = .06 and .13).</p><p>There were no significant boosting effects for any of the other scales and inclusion criteria. All of the treatment effects were descriptively positive. In addition to the liking scale reported above, the respect scale had the most consistently positive estimates across the inclusion criteria, ranging between 2% and 4% of the scale range. Although none of these effects were statistically significant (all p's &gt; .07). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Discussion</head><p>We tested if using a light touch boosting intervention could improve an existing, more intensive intervention when they are simply stacked together. The idea was that the sympathetic personal narratives video intervention could help prepare participants for the event, making them more open and receptive to MCC Respectful Conversations. If successful, this would provide an easy method to boost the effectiveness of existing interventions. In addition to this experimental component of our project, we were also able to evaluate the effectiveness of MCC Respectful Conversations.</p><p>We found that MCC Respectful Conversation events were associated with more positive attitudes, empathy, and moral humility in a one-group pre-post design. Although not part of our preregistered experiment, this is useful evidence suggestive of the benefits of MCC Respectful Conversations. Notably, because this part of the design lacks a control group, to treat the estimates of this pre-post design as a causal estimate, we need to assume that MCC Respectful Conversations was responsible for the changes. There are threats to this assumption, some more plausible than others. For example, it is possible that something happened between the pre-test and post-test that caused the changes we observe (e.g., events that depolarized the USA); however, given the relatively short timespan between the measures and that the events were held at different times throughout the year, this does not seem plausible. Similarly, we doubt the effects are due to maturation or other developmental processes; for the adults who attend these events, such processes are unlikely to occur over the course of a few days. A greater threat to the validity of this causal estimate is that participants may report more positive attitudes, empathy, and moral humility because that is what they expect from the event. Therefore, future tests of MCC Respectful Conversations (and similar programs) should use placebo control-group designs, measures less susceptible to controlled responses, and measures of longer term effects.</p><p>Our preregistered experiment tested if Civity's sympathetic personal narrative videos <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Kopell et al., 2024)</ref> could boost the effects of MCC Respectful Conservations. It primarily resulted in null results. Although this might be taken as evidence that the videos do not work, we want to encourage restraint in coming to that conclusion. In particular, at this stage and with our final sample size, we may not have had the necessary power to precisely estimate the treatment effect. The values in the confidence intervals for nearly all of the scales include both zero, but also effects that would be substantively important (especially when considering the low cost of the boosting intervention).</p><p>It is also helpful to put the effect sizes of previous tests of the intervention into context with the effect sizes in our study. The original test of the sympathetic personal narrative intervention found an effect size equivalent to b = .09 on a measure similar to our liking scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Voelkel et al., 2024)</ref>. Our effects are smaller than this, however, there are important differences between our study and the original test. The original test had the dependent measures immediately follow the intervention and the control condition was a neutral control condition (when compared to a more active control condition, the effect size is equivalent to b = .005). In our study, the intervention took place at least 1 day, if not more, prior to the dependent measures. Moreover, people in our control condition also attended the MCC Respectful Conversation event. Given this context, we might expect somewhat smaller effect sizes in our design than b = .09. Notably, the original test also measured their dependent measures after 2 weeks. After this delay, the effect size was equivalent to b = .027 or b = .018 (depending on sample inclusion criteria) on a measure similar to our liking scale. This is smaller than the effects we observed. This is to say, that the effect sizes we observe are consistent with those from <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Voelkel et al (2024)</ref> when considering time delays and neutral vs active control conditions. It is an open question as to whether we would have found larger effects with more immediate measurements of the outcomes, or if our effects would last at later measurement points. Generating lasting effects of depolarization initiatives appears difficult <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Dias et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Holliday et al., 2025;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Voelkel et al., 2024)</ref>.</p><p>It is also potentially a concern that some of the events took place so soon after a contentious election. Although we might hope that depolarization interventions, such as MCC Respectful Conversations and the sympathetic personal narrative videos, would work well in contentious environments, a major election may be too strong of a situation to overcome. Testing depolarization interventions in different political environments, with different types of political competition and outcomes will help future studies understand the extent these interventions generalize.</p><p>Finally, due to the nature of the evaluation procedure, we were unable to collect background data on the participants. If the boosting video intervention or the MCC Respectful Conversation events have different effects on people from different backgrounds, we are unable to identify that heterogeneity (our smaller sample size would also make this a challenge). </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>After identifying promising interventions, they experimentally tested 25 interventions in a large sample of US Americans. They found that 23 interventions reduce political animosity, 6 reduced support for undemocratic practices, and 5 reduce support for political violence. Of those successful interventions, our team discussed which interventions both fit well with the goals of MCC Respectful Conversations and would make the most sense to incorporate into the typical MCC Respectful Conversations process.</figDesc></figure>
