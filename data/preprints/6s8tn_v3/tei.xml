<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Refugee integration is a core policy concern. Expanding on prior research on domestic policies and elite cues, we explore whether host-country debates about military aid to refugees' homeland shape perceived support, belonging, and return intentions. We implement a survey experiment with 2,631 Ukrainian refugees in Germany. Participants viewed authentic statements by German politicians with varying support for military aid. Average effects on integration outcomes are largely null. We then argue that this stems from moderation by the information environment. Using day-to-day variation in national news coverage, we show that without national Ukraine coverage, any experimental cue-supportive, ambivalent, or opposing-negatively affected perceived integration outcomes. On days with Ukraine coverage, our treatments had no effect. We propose that these patterns reflect a contestation mechanism: refugees treat the visibility of debate, rather than its valence, as evidence that support for Ukraine is contested and acceptance of Ukrainians in Germany is weaker.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Refugee integration is a pressing global concern that carries profound implications for both displaced populations and host societies <ref type="bibr">(UNHCR, 2023)</ref>. As conflicts worldwide continue to displace millions, understanding the determinants of refugee integration is essential for promoting social cohesion, economic development, and humanitarian objectives <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Martén, Hainmueller and Hangartner, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Harder et al., 2018)</ref>. After Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, European countries faced the dual challenges of responding to an inflow of refugees and deciding on the extent of military engagement in the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian War. Germany, in particular, remains the second most popular destination for Ukrainian refugees within the EU <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Kinkartz, 2024)</ref>, while also playing an important role in determining the level of military support to Ukraine. While the German government provides social programs to support Ukrainian refugees and extends military, economic, and humanitarian aid to Ukraine, the degree to which Germany should provide military support has been frequently debated. The German population is also divided on the topic <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Hopkins, 2023)</ref>. This debate is still ongoing: in March 2025, amid the uncertainty about the US military aid, the EU Commission proposed increased support for Ukraine, 1   and the US's recent decision to reduce its own commitments has heightened the pressure on European countries to maintain or step up their engagement. 2   Prior research has examined the role of direct policies and political messaging about refugees themselves on integration <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Hainmueller, Hangartner and Pietrantuono, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Fouka, 2023)</ref>. However, just as domestic policies of host countries can affect refugee integration outcomes , national debates over military engagement in the conflict could affect refugees' integration outcomes by signaling overall (lack of) support for their country of origin and its citizens. When politicians publicly oppose military aid to refugees' country of origin, it may lead to group-based resentment towards the host country reduced perceptions of psychological safety and trust in the host society, hindering successful integration <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Phillimore, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Kuhn and Maxwell, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Weiss, 2025)</ref>. Conversely, political support for military aid may signal acceptance and inclusion, potentially increasing refugees' motivation to integrate <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Berry et al., 2006)</ref>.</p><p>In this paper, we provide the first evidence on this topic by examining the effect of German debates about military support for Ukraine on refugees' feelings of belonging, perceptions of the host country more generally, and their intentions to stay. To do so, we conducted a survey experiment on a sample of 2,631 Ukrainian refugees who resided in Germany as of March 2024. Given the difficulty of reaching this population, we used targeted online ads to recruit our study participants and expose participants to authentic statements by members of the German government, with varying levels of support for increased military support for Ukraine.</p><p>On the full sample we find no evidence that treatments affected refugees' feelings of belonging, perceptions of general refugee support, or intentions to leave Germany. Investigating mechanisms, we find that these null results are not driven by respondents who see military support as counterproductive. Similarly, we find that self-reported consumption of German mainstream news does not moderate effects.</p><p>We then investigate whether short-term fluctuations in the information environment, rather than long-term media consumption levels, may explain the overall null results. Building on work showing that individuals' attitudes are influenced most significantly by recent news coverage <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Tesler, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Zaller, 1992)</ref>, we contend that high salience of debates over military support of Ukraine in German media shortly before the survey may have saturated the information environment and muted the effects of our experimental treatments. Put differently, the short-term information environment may condition the effects of the political messages we present respondents with.</p><p>To test our argument, we leverage daily variation in coverage of Ukraine in German media, proxied by coverage in the Tagesschau, Germany's most-watched TV news program.</p><p>For each respondent, we code whether Ukraine was mentioned in the Tagesschau on the evening before she took the survey. Based on secondary evidence, we argue that Tagesschau coverage provides a good proxy for the salience of the topic at the time the respondent completed the survey <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Krämer and Schroll, 2009)</ref>. This proxy for day-to-day variation in German news coverage thus allows us to assess whether treatment effects are conditional on contemporaneous media salience.</p><p>Our findings reveal two patterns that support the information saturation argument. First, we find suggestive evidence that the national information environment independently shifts baseline perceptions among control group respondents. Following coverage in the national news, control group respondents reported lower perceptions of military support, general support for Ukrainians, belonging in German as well as increased return intentions. Moreover, we find that these patterns are independent of the valence of national media coverage, i.e. any reporting on Ukraine is associated with the same attitudinal effect.</p><p>Second, among respondents surveyed on days when Ukraine was not covered in the news, clear experimental effects emerge. In this low-salience environment, all three treatments (supportive, ambivalent, and oppositional) reduced perceived German support, increased return intentions, and decreased feelings of belonging in Germany. These shifts parallel how control-group perceptions differ between no-mention and mention days. By contrast, when Ukraine received any media coverage the preceding evening, treatment effects are near zero across all outcomes. This pattern is consistent with an information-environment saturation mechanism explaining the pooled null effects. 3   Additional checks reduce concerns about unobserved confounding. First, days with and without a Tagesschau mention of Ukraine are balanced on a wide range of respondent characteristics. Second, estimates are robust to adding a linear time trend and to alternative standard error calculations. Third, a permutation test using placebo coverage dates supports 3 Most interviews occurred on days following Ukraine coverage in German news.</p><p>the main heterogeneity result. Finally, a partial replication with an independent survey of Ukrainian refugees in Germany reproduces the valence-independent effect of media coverage on attitudes.</p><p>Taken together, the experimental and observational evidence indicate that debates about military support shape refugees' feelings of belonging, perceptions of the host country, and intentions to stay or return. Contrary to our initial expectations, message valence does not matter: any visible debate-supportive, ambivalent, or opposing-functions as a contestation signal and produces similar effects.</p><p>Our work contributes to several strands of research on refugee integration, political messaging, and conflict attitudes. First, our findings broaden the scope of research on how political rhetoric shapes the attitudes of immigrants and other minority groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Pérez, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Grewal and Hamid, 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Secen and Öztürk, 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Tyrberg, 2024)</ref>. We identify an indirect channel through which elite discourse about a homeland conflict affects perceptions of acceptance and inclusion in the host society. Unlike prior work, which has studied rhetoric that explicitly targets immigrants or minorities, we focus on political messages that address military support to refugees' country of origin. We focus on this debate because, first, the timing of a war makes military support questions especially salient and dominant in public discourse, and second, such debates are rooted in the broader question of whether host societies feel responsible for refugees-shaping how refugees interpret themselves as valued or ignored. We show that such messages, despite not mentioning refugees directly, can nonetheless influence perceptions of belonging and return intentions under certain conditions.</p><p>Our findings suggest that refugees interpret political cues about the conflict they fled not only as foreign policy positions, but also as signals of their social status and inclusion in the host society.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Second, we contribute to research on the conditional effects of political communication by</head><p>showing that elite cue effects may hinge on short-term salience in mainstream news. Building on agenda-setting and priming <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(McCombs, Shaw and Weaver, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Scheufele and Tewksbury, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Tesler, 2015)</ref>, and on RAS and pre-treatment accounts <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Zaller, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Druckman and Leeper, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Druckman, 2022)</ref>, we find that when ambient media coverage does not mention Ukraine, brief elite statements move perceived host support, belonging, and return intentions.</p><p>When Ukraine is covered, effects vanish, consistent with saturation and cue competition <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Prior, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Nicholson, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Bullock, 2011)</ref>. This also underscores the importance of measuring short-term media fluctuations as a potential moderator of political persuasion, distinct from self-reported, long-term media consumption.</p><p>Methodologically, we provide a blueprint of how to investigate this short-term salience mechanism. We rely on time-varying measures of the ambient media environment, matched with survey completion dates, to investigate how treatment effects may be conditional on the short-term media salience of a specific topic. We contend that this approach-combing experimental cues and observational media exposure data-enables researchers to distinguish true null effects of informational cues from false negatives driven by pre-treatment exposure through the organic media environment.</p><p>Finally, we document a valence-independent pattern: under low salience, all kinds of cues-supportive, ambivalent, and oppositional-shift outcomes in the same direction. This departs from arguments that emphasize directional updating under elite disagreement <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Zaller, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Chong and Druckman, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Druckman, Peterson and Slothuus, 2013)</ref>. Instead, our results suggests that the mere presence of debate may act as a signal of contestation that drives perceptions of support.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Why Military Aid Debates May Matter?</head><p>Refugee attitudes are shaped not only by integration policies but also by signals of acceptance inferred from broader political discourse <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Berry et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Phillimore, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Harder et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Fouka, 2023)</ref>. Such signals are often conveyed through elite cues-politicians' statements or policies-that refugees may use as heuristics for wider public attitudes, updating perceptions of belonging and intentions to remain <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Hainmueller, Hangartner and Pietrantuono, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Hall and Werner, 2022)</ref>. Elite rhetoric shapes attention and evaluation, and in cue-taking models, visible disagreement can dampen persuasion by activating counter-considerations <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(McCombs, Shaw and Weaver, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Tesler, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Zaller, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Druckman and Leeper, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Druckman, 2022)</ref>.</p><p>Even brief political messages shift beliefs and behaviors among minority groups. Negative ads increased political engagement among Latino Americans <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Besco et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Pérez, 2015)</ref>; inclusive statements by Chancellor Merkel reduced perceived discrimination among Muslims in Germany <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Grewal and Hamid, 2024)</ref>; and welcoming versus hostile remarks altered Syrian refugees' political engagement and sense of belonging <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Secen and Öztürk, 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Tyrberg, 2024)</ref>. Across these settings, elite rhetoric functions as a signal of group standing <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Kuhn and Maxwell, 2023)</ref>.</p><p>A key limitation of this work is its focus on direct rhetoric toward established minorities (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Grewal and Hamid, 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Pérez, 2015)</ref>. We extend this research to the context of indirect cues through military support debates, where the symbolic inclusion or exclusion communicated by elite rhetoric may be particularly potent. Lacking deep-rooted knowledge of host-country politics, and with the fate of their homeland at stake, recent refugees of war are highly motivated to scan prominent elite debates-such as those over military aid to Ukraine-for signals about their social standing and the durability of their welcome. This focus highlights a novel pathway through which elite discourse shapes integration outcomes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Symbolic Role of Military Aid</head><p>While debates over military aid are, on their surface, about geopolitics, they may function as powerful symbolic signals for affected refugee populations. Arguments over German aid to Ukraine bundle concrete policy with an implicit question of continued German material and moral investment. Under conditions of high uncertainty and personal threat, Ukrainian refugees are likely to interpret this symbolic layer as diagnostic information about expected empathy, solidarity, and long-run commitment, shaping their sense of belonging and future prospects <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Sasse and Lackner, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr">Harm Adema et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Al Husein and Wagner, 2023)</ref>.</p><p>Two channels make this plausible. First, minorities use elite statements as heuristics for mass sentiment. Second, social identity and system-justification perspectives hold that individuals scan elite discourse for cues to their group's esteem and future security <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Tajfel and Turner, 2004)</ref>. As a result aid debates can serve a double symbolic role: they communicate not only the degree of domestic solidarity with displaced Ukrainians but also the depth of Germany's geopolitical alignment with their national in-group (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Fearon, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Tomz, 2007)</ref>. Both layers can then be projected by refugees' onto their own status and safety. Supportive rhetoric, by signaling sustained commitment abroad and empathy at home, reassures psychological security, while oppositional rhetoric primes uncertainty about protection or hospitality <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Stevens and Thijs, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Hall and Werner, 2022)</ref> 4 . Applied to our case, statements favoring increased military assistance can transmit a compound signal about material commitment and moral alignment. This should elevate perceptions of support and belonging by affirming refugees' social status as a deserving group and reinforcing their sense of psychological safety. Stronger perceived host commitment should then reduce near-term return intentions by increasing expected integration payoffs (Al <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Husein and Wagner, 2023)</ref>.</p><p>Conversely, while opposition to aid could be framed as pragmatic caution, for the affected group it is more plausibly interpreted as a signal of waning solidarity. It suggests a declining willingness to bear costs on behalf of Ukrainians, which can weaken belonging by casting doubt on the durability of their welcome. Such cues could also alter expectations about conflict duration, but the primary update concerns host solidarity, not war timelines. Identity-relevant status signals shift affect and belonging quickly <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Stevens and Thijs, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Hall and Werner, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Secen and Öztürk, 2024)</ref>, shaping our expectation of reduced perceived support and</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>4</head><p>Prior experimental studies show that even brief cues on unrelated topics can shift minorities' trust and belonging <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Grewal and Hamid, 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Pérez, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Secen and Öztürk, 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Tyrberg, 2024)</ref>, consistent with heightened threat sensitivity among displaced groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Jaschke, Sardoschau and Tabellini, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Weiss, Siegel and Romney, 2023)</ref>.</p><p>belonging and (weakly) higher return intentions.</p><p>In summary, the symbolic-signal logic yields clear directional expectations for pro-and anti-aid statements. These predictions follow from a framework that treats foreign policy not as separate from domestic inclusion, but as a critical site where belonging is negotiated for diaspora communities, thus identifying an overlooked pathway through which elite discourse shapes minority integration. Based on these theoretical considerations, we derive our primary hypothesis 5 : H1: Exposure to pro-/anti-aid statements from German politicians increases/decreases Ukrainian refugees' perceptions of overall German support, feelings of belonging, and intentions of staying in Germany, relative to non-political messaging.</p><p>We pre-registered two additional moderation hypotheses. First, some refugees may view military aid as undesirable, believing it prolongs conflict and signals German intent to send them home. Such reactions likely depend on preferences for war termination: those favoring negotiations may respond differently than those supporting continued combat <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Fabbe, Hazlett and Sınmazdemir, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Lyall, Blair and Imai, 2013)</ref>. Second, prior media exposure may condition treatment effects. Refugees who frequently consume German news already have strong perceptions of the government's stance, reducing the novelty and persuasiveness of our treatments <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Druckman and Leeper, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Druckman, 2022)</ref>. Based on these theoretical considerations, we derive two additional hypotheses relating to effect moderation by war termination preferences (H2) and self-reported consumption of German media (H3).</p><p>H2: Exposure to pro-/anti-aid statements from German politicians has an effect only among refugees who prefer continued combat to protect all of Ukraine's territories over negotiations.</p><p>H3: Exposure to pro-/anti-aid statements from German politicians has an effect only among refugees who do not consume German news.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>5</head><p>Hypotheses presented here are simplified compared to the ones we pre-registered. See Appendix A.2 for a discussion of the deviations in hypotheses we state here from the pre-analysis plan.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Alternative Mechanisms</head><p>While the above symbolic inclusion mechanism provides our pre-registered baseline expectations, other pathways may operate even if refugees do not treat aid debates as solidarity cues.</p><p>Contestation. Political debates can carry informational value that derives less from the valence of any single statement and more from the publicly observable fact of sustained contestation. Work on framing and cue competition in American politics shows that when multiple elite positions circulate, audiences update not only on policy content but also on meta-information about issue security, coalition cohesion, and likely durability of support <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Slothuus, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Leeper and Slothuus, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Druckman, Levendusky and McLain, 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Studies of information saturation and selective exposure further suggest that once an issue is repeatedly cued, marginal messages increasingly function as signals that support is not unanimous <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Guess, Nyhan and Reifler, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Bullock, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Nicholson, 2011)</ref>. Unlike the symbolic mechanism, which implies directional effects based on the positivity or negativity of aid rhetoric, this "contestation mechanism" predicts valence-independent effects: what matters is not the content of the message but the public visibility of disagreement. 6</p><p>Backfire. Supportive rhetoric can also reduce, rather than increase, integration prospects.</p><p>Refugees may interpret pro-aid statements not as lasting solidarity but as signals that protections are temporary and contingent on the war's course. A large literature shows that insecure status discourages early investments in language, employment, and community ties <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Kosyakova and Brenzel, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Menjívar, Agadjanian and Oh, 2022)</ref>. Related U.S. evidence on the "public charge" debates demonstrates that even rhetorical threats of future retrenchment can depress engagement with host institutions <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bernstein et al., 2019)</ref>. In this 6</p><p>To our knowledge, this valence-independent pathway has not previously been shown to operate in the immigration or refugee integration context, and evidence of it would provide a novel explanation for why supportive and opposing cues can generate parallel negative downstream effects on integration outcomes. Below we document evidence of valence-independent effects on low-salience days consistent with this mechanism.</p><p>view, pro-aid cues may hasten expectations of return, while opposition can paradoxically reassure permanence. A probability-based IAB-BAMF-SOEP panel survey reports an even higher share, noting that "three quarters of adult respondents were women" <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Kosyakova, Rother and Zinn, 2025)</ref>.</p><p>This gender imbalance is structural rather than a sampling artifact: since the declaration of martial law on 24 February 2022, Ukrainian men aged 18-60 have been barred from leaving Ukraine except for narrow exemptions.</p><p>Female-majority profiles are typical for conflict-driven displacement: UNHCR notes that 75% of Sudanese refugees and 79% of those now in South Sudan are women and children, and more than 75% of Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh are likewise women and children <ref type="bibr">(UNHCR, N.d., 2025)</ref>. Where exit is constrained by conscription or hazardous routes, a female-dominated refugee stream is therefore the norm.</p><p>Participants were randomly assigned, using simple randomization in Qualtrics, to one of four conditions. In the placebo (Control ) condition, participants watched a neutral news segment-a weather forecast-unrelated to the Ukraine war. In the Oppose treatment, they viewed a video of an SPD politician strongly opposing weapons deliveries to Ukraine and advocating for diplomacy. In the Ambivalent treatment, participants saw a video of Chancellor Olaf Scholz (SPD) expressing opposition to sending certain weapons to Ukraine, while acknowledging other forms of support. Lastly, respondents assigned to the Support treatment were shown a video of Olaf Scholz stating that military support for Ukraine should be increased. Full video transcripts are provided in Appendix J.1.</p><p>Our main outcome indices were the German Support Index, which measures perceived German governmental and public support for Ukraine beyond military aid; the Belonging Index, which assesses feelings of belonging and integration within German society; and the Return Intentions Index, which gauges intentions to stay in Germany or return to Ukraine.</p><p>These indices were constructed from specific survey items detailed in the Appendix J.2 and J. 3. 7 We also included a manipulation check measuring perceptions of German military support for Ukraine, which corresponds to the belief that our treatment is supposed to manipulate.</p></div>

All outcomes are standardized using the control group mean and standard deviation. The main estimates are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">1</ref>. We first assessed whether the experimental treatments effectively shifted participants' perceptions of German military support for Ukraine. Participants exposed to statements opposing military aid (Oppose) reported significantly lower perceptions of German military support than the control group. The size of this effect-at 0.39 control-group standard deviations-is meaningful.</p><p>As we expected, the weaker statement used in the Ambivalent treatment had a weaker effect that did not reach statistical significance. Results are similar without covariates; see Appendix Estimates correspond to the effect of treatment relative to the control condition (weather report). See Section C for the corresponding regression table.</p><p>Despite these shifts in perceptions of military support, we found no significant effects of the treatments on our main outcomes. The treatments did not significantly affect participants' overall perceptions of German support for Ukrainians beyond military aid, as measured by the German Support Index. Similarly, there were no notable differences in feelings of belonging or integration within German society, according to the Belonging Index, across the different treatment conditions. Additionally, the likelihood of intending to return to Ukraine, as captured by the Return Intentions Index, did not differ significantly between participants exposed to different treatments. These results suggest that the overall effect of exposure to political debates about military support on Ukrainian refugees' integration-related attitudes is not distinguishable from zero.  In the pre-analysis plan we registered several diagnostic tests for potential assumption violations that could threaten our experimental inferences. These included: (i) an attention check embedded in the survey (passed by 95.6% of the final study sample); (ii) tests of balance on pre-treatment covariates across experimental groups (see Appendix B.3); (iii) a manipulation check using a direct item on perceived German military support for Ukraine (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">1</ref>); (iv) tests related to the Missing-At-Random (MAR) assumption for attrition (see Appendix E.3); and (v) an experimenter demand test using an endline question about the study's purpose (see Appendix E.2). Across these diagnostics, we find no evidence of violations that would undermine validity of our experimental estimates. Although inattentiveness and effects of treatment on correctly guessing the study aims are non-zero, their magnitudes are small and unlikely to affect the results we report in the paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Pre-registered mechanisms</head><p>Our main specification shows no evidence that information about opposition to military support for Ukraine changes feelings of belonging, perceptions of general refugee support, or intentions to leave the host country. We now discuss and test several mechanisms to explain these overall null results.</p><p>First, some refugees might view military support as counter-productive, preferring diplomacy. We surveyed this preference, finding a sizable minority (38%) favors negotiations over continued fighting. Second, sustained engagement with German media could create differential baseline responsiveness to our treatments. 8 Investigating heterogeneity based on these potential moderators, our analysis provides no support for either mechanism. The results, presented in Figure D.1, show no evidence of effect heterogeneity on the main integration outcomes across any of these subgroups. Therefore, neither differing war preferences nor prior media consumption appears to explain the overall null results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>8</head><p>We define this measure based on a survey item that asks respondents to indicate whether they consume mainstream German news media. This includes, e.g., the Tagesschau or newspapers like FAZ or Die Zeit. Respondents can select from a list of predefined mainstream outlets and/or fill out a text entry field. Our moderator is defined as one if respondents select any of the predefined outlets or if the text entry fields list a mainstream outlet. If neither of those is the case, the moderator is defined as zero.</p><p>However, long-term self-reported media consumption might not accurately capture the relevant dynamics for a number of reasons. First, self-reported consumption has been shown to be a poor measure of actual consumption <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Konitzer et al., 2021)</ref>. Secondly, individuals' attitudes may be shaped through indirect exposure because "those who watch [...] talk to and persuade others who did not watch" <ref type="bibr">(Druckman, Levendusky and McLain, 2018, p. 99)</ref>.</p><p>Third, especially in fast-developing and highly volatile debates such as those over a recently erupted military conflict, short-term changes in the information environment may be more consequential than long-term consumption levels.</p><p>We therefore posit an additional, exploratory explanation of our overall null results that was not part of the pre-analysis plan: an "information environment saturation" mechanism, whereby short-term fluctuations in the level of support communicated by the media may condition treatment effects.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Effect Heterogeneity by Information Environment Saturation</head><p>While our pooled estimates suggest little evidence that our treatments significantly shifted integration-related outcomes, the null results we report above simply show that the marginal signal respondents receive from our treatments, on average, do not have a detectable effect.</p><p>However, respondents do not enter the survey experimental environment as a blank slate; rather, they arrive with attitudes already shaped by the broader information environment to which they have recently been exposed, including news coverage, public debates, and other political signals circulating in their daily lives. This pre-existing exposure can amplify, mute, or crowd out the influence of our experimental cues, meaning that the effects of political debates over military support may only manifest under certain conditions-specifically, when the surrounding information environment is relatively sparse. 9</p><p>The most direct test of moderation by the overall information environment draws on short-term measures of media reporting. To proxy for the overall media environment, we draw on transcripts of the 8 p.m. edition of the Tagesschau, Germany's most-watched daily TV news program. Based on these transcripts, we code whether Ukraine was mentioned and, if so, whether German politicians expressed support, opposition, or ambivalence toward military aid. This approach allows us to assess whether the salience and content of contemporaneous media coverage moderate our experimental treatment effects.</p><p>This analysis builds on research showing that media coverage creates shared informational contexts that fundamentally alter how individuals process information <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Zaller, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Prior, 2007)</ref>.

When issues receive extensive coverage, the information environment becomes saturated, reducing the marginal effect of additional messages through two main pathways.</p><p>First, pre-treatment effects occur when ambient exposure to political information-through headlines, public discourse, or repeated references in multiple outlets-shapes individuals' baseline attitudes before any experimental intervention <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Druckman and Leeper, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Druckman, Peterson and Slothuus, 2013)</ref>. This means that even respondents who do not directly consume the media source in question may still be indirectly exposed through interpersonal discussion, social media circulation, or spillovers from other outlets <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Druckman, Levendusky and McLain, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Barabas and Jerit, 2009)</ref>. Such pre-treatment can narrow the scope for experimental messages to shift attitudes because the core considerations relevant to the issue are already activated.</p><p>Second, opinion crystallization occurs when repeated exposure to consistent messages 9</p><p>We have decided to present the theoretical and empirical discussion of this mechanism after the main results to transparently reflect the research process, since we derived this mechanism after collecting the data and obtaining the main results.</p><p>stabilizes attitudes, making them more resistant to change <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Tesler, 2015)</ref>. Once individuals have formed a strong evaluative position, additional messages-whether congruent or incongruent-are less likely to move them, and may instead be filtered through motivated reasoning processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Taber and Lodge, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Jerit and Zhao, 2020)</ref>. Over time, high-salience issues become "settled" in the minds of attentive audiences, reducing the capacity for new cues to generate measurable change.</p><p>This saturation dynamic is particularly relevant in highly politicized contexts, where media coverage not only supplies factual information but also signals the presence of elite contestation <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bullock, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Nicholson, 2011)</ref>. In such contexts, the marginal informational value of an additional statement-like those used in our treatments-depends critically on whether it introduces genuinely novel content or simply joins a pre-existing canon of messages on an already salient topic.</p><p>Therefore, we propose (1) that any exposure to discussion of military support to Ukraine, whether experimental or ambient, may shift baseline perceptions of support; and (2) that experimental treatments will only have measurable effects when the information environment is relatively sparse (i.e., when Ukraine is not being actively discussed in media) but will be "crowded out" when the environment is already saturated with relevant content. This leads to two testable implications: first, baseline perceptions of support should differ systematically based on short-term fluctuations in the level of media coverage; and second, treatment effects should be moderated by the presence or absence of contemporaneous media coverage about Ukraine.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Media Coverage Data</head><p>To test the proposed mechanism, we examine treatment effect heterogeneity based on German media coverage of Ukraine on the day preceding survey participation. To measure media coverage, we rely on official transcripts from the 8:00 p.m. edition of the Tagesschau, which is Germany's most-watched daily TV news program. We code whether Ukraine was mentioned on a particular day and, if so, whether German politicians expressed support, opposition, or ambivalence toward military aid. 10 This approach allows us to assess whether the contemporaneous coverage moderates our experimental treatment effects.</p><p>The Tagesschau is Germany's most important and widely viewed national news broadcast, airing daily at 8:00 p.m. on the public television channel ARD. Its viewership consistently exceeds ten million, making it the single most influential news source in shaping public awareness of political events. Multiple sources indicate that refugees' consumption of German media is substantial (Appendix A.3). Because the Tagesschau sets the national news agenda for the following day, the topics covered on the Tagesschau reflect the broader informational environment to which most Germans, and also many refugees, are exposed <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Deutschlandfunk, 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr">ARD Programmdirektion, 2025;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Maier, Ruhrmann and Stengel, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Krämer and Schroll, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Mayerhöffer and Heft, 2022)</ref>.</p><p>From the German public broadcaster ARD, we obtain daily transcripts of the 8:00 p.m.</p><p>Tagesschau broadcast.

Given the smaller sample size due to focusing on the control group, standard errors are larger. Differences are significant at α = 0.1 for belonging, German support and return intentions outcomes. The difference is not significant for the military support outcome.  This demonstrates how the information environment shapes baseline perceptions even before experimental treatment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Treatment Effects Conditional on Media Environment</head><p>To investigate whether our experimental treatments do affect outcomes during periods of low salience, we re-estimate our main specification on two subsamples: respondents sampled when Ukraine was not mentioned in the Tagesschau (14.2% of the total sample) versus when it was (85.8%). independent pattern strongly supports a contestation signaling mechanism. Any political attention to military aid, regardless of valence, conveys that support is debated rather than assured.</p><p>In contrast, when Ukraine received any media coverage (85.8% of our sample), treatment effects became small and statistically indistinguishable from zero across all outcomes. The oppose treatment reduced German support perceptions (without manipulation check) by only 0.03 standard deviations and increased return intentions by just 0.02 standard deviations-substantially smaller than the effects observed without coverage. Treatment effects across all outcomes ranged from -0.18 to +0.08 standard deviations with most being statistically insignificant. This pattern holds regardless of whether the coverage was supportive, opposing, or neutral, indicating that the mere presence of Ukraine in the media environment, rather than its specific content, drives the moderation effect.</p><p>Disaggregating coverage further into support, oppose, and mentioned-without-stance yields the same conclusion: There are sizable treatment effects only on no-coverage days, whereas on coverage days effects are small and largely indistinguishable from zero across stances. We present the disaggregated specifications in Appendix Figure E.3.</p><p>Importantly, we note that the direction and magnitude of the experimental results in the no-coverage subsample closely align with the observational control-group mean differences presented in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>: media coverage of military support debates decreases perceived levels of military support and general levels of support for Ukrainians, and increases return intentions while decreasing feelings of belonging in Germany, regardless of message content.</p><p>For completeness, we also estimate the corresponding interaction models that pool the two subsets and interact each treatment with an indicator for "No mention." The interaction coefficients, reported in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">E</ref>.2, mirror the visual pattern in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref>: treatment effects are concentrated in the no-coverage condition. columns ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">1</ref>)-( <ref type="formula">4</ref>) report models without covariates; columns (5)-( <ref type="formula">8</ref>) add controls. Results are highly similar across specifications.</p><p>Taken together, these findings suggest that political debates over military support affect Ukrainian refugees' feelings of general host-country support as well as their return intentions and feelings of belonging in Germany. Interestingly, the magnitude and direction of these effects does not vary by the valence of the information: any coverage of military support debates-whether supportive or oppositional-signals that support is contested rather than universally agreed upon, aligning with research showing that the mere presence of political debate conveys important information about political divisions on the issue <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bullock, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Nicholson, 2011)</ref>.</p><p>In our specific case, debates about military aid to refugees' homeland carry particular significance. Social identity theory suggests that group members are especially attentive to signals about their group's status and acceptance <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Tajfel and Turner, 2001)</ref>. When political elites debate support for Ukraine, refugees may interpret this as evidence that their cause lacks unanimous backing, regardless of individual politicians' positions. This creates a paradoxical effect, whereby even supportive statements can reduce perceived support by highlighting the existence of opposition.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">Internal and External Validity</head><p>To assess the robustness of these findings, we first note that since treatment assignment remains random within each media coverage subset, the subgroup effects presented in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref> are unbiased within both the no-coverage and any-coverage subsamples.</p><p>However, to interpret the difference in treatment effects between subsamples as evidence of information environment saturation, we require an additional assumption: that assignment to media coverage conditions is uncorrelated with potential outcomes. In other words, whether a respondent completed the survey following (no) Ukraine coverage in the Tagesschau must be 'as-if random' with respect to their latent responsiveness to the treatments.</p><p>Addressing potential confounding: While not directly testable, we provide three pieces of evidence in support of this assumption in Appendix G. First, we demonstrate that days with or without Ukraine coverage are not systematically clustered but distributed relatively evenly across our survey period (see <ref type="bibr">Figure G.1)</ref>. This temporal distribution suggests that coverage patterns reflect day-to-day editorial decisions rather than systematic trends that could confound our results. Second, we show that respondents in both subsamples are balanced on a variety of pre-treatment covariates, including demographics, region, move motivation, vote choice in Ukraine, prior media exposure, prior integration, and war termination preferences</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">(Figure G.2).</formula><p>Third, we address the concern of unobserved confounding that is correlated with the survey date. We re-estimate the split-sample specification in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref> using a linear time trend (see <ref type="bibr">Figure G.3)</ref>. The results of this robustness check are very similar to the original pattern, which alleviates concerns that unobserved, time-varying confounding drives our findings. Together, these tests suggest that our findings reflect a genuine interaction between experimental treatments and the broader information environment rather than a spurious correlation driven by unobserved confounders.</p><p>Permutation evidence based on placebo coverage dates: Complementing these checks, we implement a permutation-style check in Appendix G.9. If the information environment effects are spurious, we would expect similar coefficients as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref> using "placebo" coverage dates -that is, coverage on dates further in the past or even in the future. Instead of assigning coverage to a respondent surveyed on day t based on the Tagesschau edition on day t -1, we construct a reference distribution by shifting the coverage window over days t -k with k ∈ [-10, 10], k ̸ = 1. This means that, instead of the previous evening, we assess treatment effect moderation by coverage that occurred several days before or after the survey date t. Coverage on these placebo dates should not moderate our main treatment effects. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">12</ref>We then compare the estimated moderation effect to the placebo distribution. We find that the observed moderation in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref> is unusually large. We calculate two-sided p-values by counting the number of placebo estimates with absolute magnitude at least as large as the observed effect. We obtain p = 0.000 for perceived German support, belonging, and return intentions, and p = 0.200 for military support. We interpret this as additional evidence that the moderation effects in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref> derive from the short-term information environment rather than from spurious fluctuations in treatment effects across different days.</p><p>treatment: coverage may be more likely precisely when the conflict is more severe, so Tagesschau mentions could proxy recent conflict intensity. To address this, we use daily casualties from UCDP GED (v25.1) to proxy for conflict intensity. We compute windowed averages over the previous k days (k = 1, 2, 3) for each Tagesschau day (the evening before respondents' survey date) and compare casualties preceding mention or no-mention days.</p><p>Across all casualty measures, the differences in total casualties are small. This indicates that mentions in the Tagesschau do not merely track short-run conflict intensity (for more details </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Multiple comparisons correction:</head><p>To address multiplicity, we pre-specified two families of tests, main treatment effects and Tagesschau interaction effects, and applied Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate control at q = 0.10 within each family. After adjustment, no average (pooled-sample) treatment effects on the three primary indices are significant, reinforcing the conclusion of null average effects. In contrast, several treatment-by-low-salience (no Tagesschau mention) interactions remain significant after FDR correction-specifically, decreases in perceived German support (Oppose, Support), increases in return intentions (all three treatments), and a decline in belonging (Oppose). This suggests that the salienceconditioned findings are not artifacts of multiple testing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.5">Heterogeneity by War Termination Preferences.</head><p>Similar to the pre-registered analyses, we can expect that the treatment effects we observe on low-saturation days are moderated by war-termination preferences (fight to retake all territory vs. negotiate even with territorial concessions). We therefore restrict to the nomention subsample and re-estimate the model separately for these two groups. Because The results on no-mention subsample should be read cautiously given small sample sizes, but a clear pattern emerges. Among "hawks" (those who prefer fight to retake all territory) the treatment sharply lowers perceived German military support and broader German support for Ukrainians; this shift is absent among "doves" (those who favor negotiations and possible territorial concessions). In contrast, the increase in return intentions is larger for dovesdriven by a higher stated likelihood of returning to Ukraine. Belonging declines modestly and similarly for both groups, primarily via weaker reported connection to Germans and stronger outsider feelings (see Figure D.2 in the Appendix).</p><p>Taken together, the pattern is consistent with the valence-independent contestation mechanism. Under low salience, any elite cue (regardless of valence) appears to function as a contestation signal. Hawks respond primarily by sharply downgrading perceived, military and broader, German support-consistent with interpreting visible debate as wavering allied resolve. Doves show comparatively little belief updating about support but do increase their return or onward intentions, suggesting they translate contestation into revised migration timing rather than into support re-assessment. Both groups register modest declines in belonging, in line with the idea that debate visibility-rather than its directional contentsignals a less secure social status. Given small subgroup Ns, these heterogeneity estimates are imprecise and should be viewed as suggestive.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Discussion</head><p>In this paper, we set out to examine whether German political debates about military support for Ukraine affected Ukrainian refugees' integration-related attitudes. While our main experimental results suggest only little evidence of these debates meaningfully shifting respondents' perceptions, additional analyses suggest that the experimental treatments produced substantively and statistically significant effects when the broader information environment was not already saturated by coverage of these debates. When the Tagesschau did not mention Ukraine the evening before our respondents were surveyed, brief, authentic statements by German elite politicians on the topic of military aid-whether supportive, oppositional, or ambivalent in content-moved outcomes in the same direction: perceived German support (aid-specific and more general) fell, feelings of belonging in Germany decreased, and return intensions rose. When Ukraine received any coverage, the experimental treatment effects were small and statistically indistinguishable from zero.</p><p>Observationally, control-group baselines on days with media coverage of the debate shifted in the same directions as the experimental effects observed on no-coverage days, again regardless of the valence content of the debate. These results indicate that (i) the marginal effect of the experimental exposure to the debate can only be measured when respondents have not already been pre-treated through coverage outside the experimental environment, and (ii) that it the presence of public contestation-rather than message valence-that refugees use to update beliefs.</p><p>This study makes several contributions to the literature. Conceptually, we recast elite debates as evidence of contestation, whereby any elite cue, regardless of valence, can have negative effects on perceived levels of support by signaling disagreement. This valenceindependence suggests that even supportive statements can reduce perceived support and belonging among migrants and nudge migration plans toward return. Furthermore, substantively, we widen the lens from rhetoric about immigrants to elite discourse about the conflict they fled. Foreign-policy debates that never mention refugees nonetheless carry integration-relevant information, shaping perceived acceptance and migration intentions.</p><p>This connects research on minority politics to work on wartime public opinion and alliance credibility, showing that refugees interpret domestic contestation over military aid as a signal about future support for their group.</p><p>Methodologically, the study demonstrates the importance of accounting for information environment saturation when designing survey experiments on politically salient topics. Our findings suggest that experimental treatments may appear ineffective when pooled across all respondents, even when accounting for self-reported long-term media consumption, but can reveal substantial effects when disaggregated by the ambient, short-term media environment.</p><p>This highlights a broader challenge in experimental research: treatments that seem to "fail" may actually succeed under specific informational conditions, but these effects can be masked by pre-treatment through everyday information exposure. Our approach of linking daily media content to individual survey responses offers a template for future studies seeking to understand how experimental interventions interact with naturally occurring information flows. By coding the content and timing of mainstream media coverage and matching it to survey participation dates, researchers can better isolate the marginal effects of experimental treatments from the background information environment that shapes baseline attitudes.</p><p>Using authentic political statements (Appendix A.4) rather than vignettes improves external validity without sacrificing experimental control. Pairing real rhetoric with day-level measures of the information environment strengthens inference about how debates shape refugee integration and offers a template for other cases, such as immigration policy, trade affecting ethnic communities, and diaspora-relevant foreign policy.</p><p>We further explore what drives the contestation mechanism at the individual level. Within the low-salience subset where treatments meaningfully shift outcomes, we find suggestive evidence that refugees with different war termination preferences respond through distinct pathways. Refugees favoring continued military resistance ("hawks") mainly downgrade perceptions of German (military and general) support-consistent with updating on wavering allied resolve. Those favoring a negotiated settlement ("doves") adjust return/onward plans more than beliefs-treating contestation as a cue to reassess migration timing rather than allied commitment. Both groups exhibit modest declines in belonging, consistent with debate visibility signaling a less secure social status. Given small subgroup samples, these patterns are suggestive and warrant further investigation.</p><p>Finally, we discuss generalizability of our findings. The mechanism we document should travel to settings where two conditions occur. First, the relevant foreign policy debate has become contentious in mainstream news (i.e., not a quiet consensus but an openly contested issue). Second, the affected refugee or diaspora group faces uncertainty about the durability of host support, for instance, through temporary protections, budget fights, or shifting political coalitions. We contend that these conditions are common. The high-salience debates over Ukraine aid in national legislatures, such as the recent discussions in the German Bundestag following the new government's coalition agreement, illustrate elite contestation. At the same time, periodic policy shifts and budget reassessments by European governments create uncertainty that refugees with temporary status are likely to perceive. Where either condition is absent, because the issue is settled or the diaspora enjoys secure, long-term status, our effects should not appear. Framed this way, our contribution is general: in contexts where contentious elite debate exist, and where refugees are exposed to uncertainty, we should expect similar, valence-independent shifts in perceived support, belonging, and migration intentions.</p><p>that the turn to German outlets is motivated by a search for "more diverse perspectives" and by the desire to practice language skills. Complementary evidence arises from administrative and panel data. In the IAB-BAMF-SOEP refugee panel, wave 2 (July 2023-January 2024), approximately 70% of Ukrainian respondents report having completed an integration or language course; among these participants, "regular watching of German news programs or reading German press" is documented as one of the most common voluntary activities undertaken to reinforce classroom learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Brücker et al., 2024)</ref>. A separate evaluation of the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees' Erstorientierungskurse likewise finds that course instructors systematically recommend publicbroadcast news formats for self-study, and that participants subsequently adopt these media as everyday information sources (für Migration und Flüchtlinge, 2023). Taken together, the survey and administrative records demonstrate that exposure to German public-service news is neither incidental nor marginal but forms an integral component of many refugees' information environments. This prevalence strengthens the plausibility that elite cues broadcast via Tagesschau can reach and influence a sizable segment of the Ukrainian refugee population.</p></div>

During the Taurus debate, Chancellor Scholz repeatedly rejected deliveries with references to prudence and to the requirement that German soldiers must not be associated with target selection; he defended this stance in the Bundestag and in press appearances. 13  Contemporary reporting likewise framed the dispute in terms of proportionality, legal constraints, and alliance management, rather than hostile affect toward Ukrainians. 14 Because the public debate rarely employed emotive or outgroup-directed language, we used muted, authentic clips that preserved this register.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>G.2 Classification Rules and Prompts</head><p>The exact prompts used for our GPT-4o-mini classification are provided below, in both German (original) and English (translation). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>G.3 Coverage Examples During Survey Period</head><p>To illustrate the variation in German media coverage of military support for Ukraine during our study period, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_13">G</ref>  In der Ukraine gedenken die Menschen heute der Opfer von Butscha. In der Kleinstadt wurden Hunderte Zivilisten ermordet. Als die russischen Besatzer vor genau zwei Jahren abzogen, lagen Leichen auf den Straßen -viele gefesselt und gefoltert. Die Ukraine wirft Moskau Kriegsverbrechen vor... In Ukraine, people are commemorating the victims of Bucha today. Hundreds of civilians were murdered in the small town. When the Russian occupiers withdrew exactly two years ago, bodies lay on the streetsmany bound and tortured. Ukraine accuses Moscow of war crimes...</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>G.4 Temporal Distribution of Coverage Types</head><p>During our survey period, among the 31 Tagesschau episodes on survey-relevant dates, 41.9% were classified as "Mentioned but no stance" (coverage of Ukraine without reference to German government stance), 25.8% as "Support" (signaling government support for military aid), 22.6% as "Not mentioned" (no Ukraine coverage), and 9.7% as "Oppose" (signaling government opposition to military aid, primarily regarding Taurus missile deliveries). No episodes were classified as taking a neutral stance during this period. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>G.5 Balance Across Media Coverage Conditions</head><p>To assess whether our sample exhibits systematic differences based on media coverage patterns that could confound our analysis, we examine balance across covariates by Tagesschau coverage on the day preceding survey participation. Figure G.2 presents standardized differences in means between respondents who participated when Ukraine received any media coverage versus those who participated when Ukraine was not mentioned in German media.  The balance analysis reveals no systematic evidence of selection into our sample based on media coverage patterns. Across 29 demographic, socioeconomic, geographic, and moderator covariates (including war termination preferences, prior media exposure, and prior integration), we observe only one statistically significant difference (3.4% of tests) and one marginally significant difference (3.4% of tests), with 93.1% of comparisons showing no significant imbalance. Most importantly, all standardized differences fall well within conventional balance thresholds, with no differences exceeding 0.25 standard deviations and only a few exceeding the more stringent 0.1 standard deviation threshold.</p><p>This balance indicates that respondents who participated during periods of high versus low Ukraine media salience are comparable across observed characteristics. Therefore, the differential treatment effects we observe by media coverage condition are unlikely to be driven by systematic differences in sample composition.</p><p>We also conducted balance tests across the more granular, uncollapsed Tagesschau coverage categories (support, oppose, mentioned but no stance, and not mentioned). These analyses similarly revealed only very few statistically significant differences across covariates, with small substantive differences that fall well within conventional balance thresholds. This additional evidence further confirms that our sample composition does not vary systematically by the specific type of media coverage on survey days.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>G.6 Time-trend adjusted treatment effects by media coverage</head><p>To address potential unobserved time-varying confounding, we re-estimate the treatment effects by Tagesschau coverage with a linear time trend added to the regression model. Specifically, we include a covariate equal to the number of days since the first survey date and replicate the split-sample specification from Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref>. We report the results in Figure G.3. The time-trend adjusted results closely mirror the unadjusted results: sizable negative effects on perceived German support and increased return intentions, with similar magnitudes, remain concentrated in the no-coverage subsample. Effects remain small and imprecise when coverage is present. If anything, adding the time trend slightly tightens several confidence intervals without changing qualitative conclusions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>G.7 Clustered-by-day treatment effects by media coverage</head><p>As an additional check for within-day correlation in outcomes, we re-estimate the splitsample specification clustering standard errors by survey day. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>G.9 Permutation test based on placebo coverage dates</head><p>We assess whether the sharp difference in treatment effects between "Any mention" and "No mention" at lag k=1 reflects a genuine alignment with the news environment, rather than an artifact of generic day-to-day fluctuations. For each integer shift k in a symmetric window around the survey date (we use k ∈ [-10, 10] and keep only shifts with available Tagesschau data), we recompute the pooled treatment effect (treated vs. control) separately within the two media conditions and take the difference ∆ k ≡ τ Any (k) -τ None (k). By construction, positive k are lags (coverage dated k days before the survey date); thus k=1 is the design-relevant case where Tagesschau coverage is measured on the evening before a respondent completes the survey. Negative k are leads (i.e., using coverage from dates after the interview). The rationale for examining these placebo shifts is straightforward: coverage many days before the interview, or any coverage dated after it, should not systematically change the treatmentcontrol difference. If our interpretation is correct, only the previous-evening case (k=1) should stand out. We therefore compare ∆ k=1 to the empirical distribution of {∆ k : k ̸ = 1} and report a two-sided empirical p-value p = 1</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">|K| k̸ =1 ⊮{ |∆ k | ≥ |∆ 1 | }. Figure G</formula><p>.6 shows the permutation distributions (histograms of ∆ k for k ̸ = 1) with the observed statistic ∆ 1 indicated by a dashed line. The empirical two-sided p-values are: 0.000 for German support (without the manipulation item), 0.000 for return intentions, 0.000 for belonging, and 0.200 for military support. These values indicate that the k=1 alignment is unusually large relative to other shifts for support, belonging, and return intentions, consistent with a short-term information-saturation interpretation. We take this as evidence that the observed alignment at k=1 reflects a genuine effect rather than spurious timing. </p></div>

This valence-</figDesc></figure>

Alternative standard errors: Additionally, to account for possible within-day dependence and short-run serial correlation, we implement two complementary adjustments: first, we cluster standard errors by survey day, which modestly widens confidence intervals without altering substantive conclusions (see Appendix G.7 and Figure G.4). Second, we compute heteroskedasticity-and autocorrelation-consistent Newey-West standard errors with a three-day lag based on the survey date to accommodate a smoothly evolving information environment, which yields substantively identical results (see Appendix G.8 and Figure G.5). Partial replication using SOEP survey data: We replicate some of our results using a different survey data set: the IAB-BiB/FReDA-BAMF-SOEP survey of Ukrainian refugees. Using data from 2023 and outcomes on intentions to stay in Germany or return to Ukraine, we again merge survey responses to Tagesschau coverage on the preceding day. Comparing respondents who are either exposed or not exposed to Ukraine coverage, we again find that media attention to Ukraine (any mention) is associated with increased return intentions and lower intention to stay, regardless of message valence. The results using this additional dataset reproduce the sign and pattern of the findings in Figure 3, which reduces concern that the results are sample-or measurement-specific.

While we offered entry into a raffle for Amazon vouchers as compensation, we mitigated undue influence by specifying in the consent form that participation in the raffle was possible without completing the survey. Our recruitment materials emphasized the opportunity to share opinions and experiences, mentioning the raffle only subtly to avoid coercion. To prevent any unintended negative consequences of the intervention-especially since it could affect respondents' migration intentions-we included a debriefing at the end of the survey explaining the study's purpose and experimental nature, allowing participants to readjust any influenced attitudes. Participants were informed of their right to withdraw at any time, and we provided contact information for support services, including a hotline for Ukrainians in Germany, should they experience any distress during the survey.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A.2 Deviations from pre-analysis plan</head><p>We note three main deviations from the pre-analysis plan (https://osf.io/32h9n).</p><p>First, because the data did not support our preregistered directional hypotheses, we report two-sided tests and corresponding confidence intervals throughout; Hypotheses H1-H3 in Section 2 are stated accordingly.</p><p>Second, the preregistered German support index originally bundled the military support perception item that also serves as our manipulation check. Since that item is mechanically most proximate to the treatment, we report versions of the German support index both including and excluding it and use the standalone military support item as the manipulation check.</p><p>Third, the plan included an observational design leveraging quasi-random initial regional allocation of refugees in Germany. By the time of fieldwork, substantial secondary moves and pre-arranged placements meant too few respondents still resided in their originally assigned localities; consequently, we did not implement or report that observational component.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A.3 Media consumption among Ukrainian refugees</head><p>Several independent data sources indicate that a substantial share of Ukrainian refugees in Germany routinely follow domestic news media. A commissioned survey by the European Centre for Press and Media Freedom (ECPMF) and the JX Fund, fielded by FORSA between April and July 2023 (N = 508), shows that 42% of respondents report using at least one German-language outlet for political information; the most frequently named sources are Deutsche Welle (23%), Tagesschau (13%), ZDF heute (9%), and Der Spiegel (13%) (European Centre for <ref type="bibr">Press and Media Freedom, 2023)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E.3 Attrition</head><p>For our main attrition indicator, we coded an observation as missing if the respondent reached the treatment assignment in the survey, but all main outcomes were missing. Based on this indicator, we observe an attrition rate of approximately 8.9%. Table <ref type="table">D</ref>.1 below presents the results of pre-registered attrition tests of missingness related to treatment assignment-unequal variance t-tests and F -tests of the relationship between attrition and treatment-by-covariate interactions. The results indicate that our main treatments, Oppose and Ambivalent, did not show attrition rates different from the control condition. However, attrition rates in the Support treatment were systematically different from all other experimental groups, suggesting that the video shown in this condition prompted respondents to drop out.  Clustering by survey day modestly widens some confidence intervals, as expected, but leaves the substantive pattern intact: effects are concentrated in the no-coverage condition and remain small and imprecise under any coverage. We find no indication that the main conclusions hinge on not clustering by day.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>G.8 Newey-West (HAC) standard errors by media coverage</head><p>As an additional robustness check for serial correlation across survey days, we re-estimate the split-sample specification using Newey-West heteroskedasticity-and autocorrelationconsistent (HAC) standard errors with a 3-day lag, using the survey date as the time index and respondent id as the panel identifier (Figure G.5). The estimates closely match the baseline and clustered-by-day results: confidence intervals widen minimally and the substantive conclusions remain unchanged. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H Multiple-comparisons adjustments</head><p>To guard against false positives from testing several outcomes and treatments, we pre-specified two families and controlled the false discovery rate (FDR) at 10% using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure. We report BH q-values in Tables H.2 and H.3. A q-value is the Benjamini-Hochberg-adjusted p-value and can be read as the minimum FDR level at which the test would be called significant; at our preregistered 10% threshold, results with q ≤ 0.10 are treated as discoveries. Unlike Bonferroni, this controls the expected share of false positives among the rejections rather than the probability of any false positive in the family.</p><p>The first family (main effects) contains the three primary indices (German support, Belonging, Return intentions) crossed with the three treatment contrasts (Oppose, Ambivalent, Support vs. Control), for nine tests. The second family (Tagesschau moderation) contains the same indices crossed with the three treatment-by-No mention interactions, again nine tests.</p><p>After FDR correction, none of the main-effect coefficients in Family 1 are significant (Table <ref type="table">H</ref> <ref type="bibr">.2)</ref>. This supports the conclusion that there are no detectable average treatment effects across the full sample.</p><p>In contrast, several interaction terms in Family 2 remain significant after the same FDR control (Table <ref type="table">H</ref>.3). When Ukraine was not mentioned in the Tagesschau on the previous day, return intentions increase for all three treatments; perceived German support decreases for the Oppose and Support treatments; and belonging decreases for the Oppose treatment. This aligns with the figures and reinforces our interpretation that effects emerge in low-salience news environments and are largely independent of message valence. We conclude that multiple testing is not driving our results. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>J.2 Measurement of outcomes and moderators</head><p>This Section details the construction of outcomes and moderators we use in the main analyses in the paper. All question numbers refer to the Appendix J.3 below. We elicit a total of nine main outcome items. To increase precision and mitigate issues arising due to family-wise error rates (FWER), we combine these into three core outcome indices by first recoding them to go in the same direction, then standartizing them using control group means and standard deviations, and then summing them up into index. The three main outcome indices are:</p><p>1. Return intentions: This is the index of the three sub-items asked in question 22 as shown in the Appendix J.3. Each sub-item is included in such a way that the resulting index will measure the likelihood of returning to Ukraine (i.e., higher values will translate to a higher likelihood of intending to return).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Belonging in Germany:</head><p>This index measures the perceived sense of belonging in Germany based on questions 23-25 as shown in the Appendix J.3. Higher values will measure a greater sense of belonging.</p><p>3. German support: This index measures the degree to which respondents perceive the German government and the German population to be supportive of Ukraine. It is the average of the first and third sub-items of question 26 as shown in the Appendix J.3.</p><p>Higher values indicate greater perceivedGerman support for Ukraine.</p><p>In addition to the main outcome indices, we use responses to the second sub-item of question 26 (see Appendix J.3) as a manipulation check. This item directly measures respondents' perceptions of German military aid to Ukraine, which is the primary focus of our treatment videos. This also constitutes a departure from our pre-analysis plan as we initially planned to include answers to this question into the German support index described above.</p><p>Finally, we rely on a number of pre-treatment question in our survey to measure moderators we consider in Section 4.1. We use questions 6 and 15 to measure prior consumption of mainstream German media and preferences for territorial loss respectively. To measure prior integration we construct an index of all sub-items in questions 16 and 17 and second sub-item of question 18. 11.</p><p>[MULTIPLE] Which factors motivated your choice to move here?</p><p>• We were assigned to move to this settlement after registering in one of the distribution centers in Germany</p><p>• We had family or friends living in this locality</p><p>• We found a host family that was willing to host us [SINGLE] How many people, including yourself, live in your current household?
