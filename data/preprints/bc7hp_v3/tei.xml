<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>People constantly decide how much time to invest in more versus less rewarding activities.</p><p>Foraging tasks, during which participants visit contexts with diminishing reward rates, examine this type of decision-making by measuring when individuals choose to switch contexts. It is widely known that humans and other animals perform suboptimally in these tasks. However, the precise nature of this suboptimality, and its links to other behaviourally relevant traits, remain unclear. Here, we developed a foraging task to disambiguate the impacts of initial reward rates and reward rate changes. We investigated how foraging behaviour differs with age and relates to apathy and depression, which are key factors known to influence reward-based decision-making, while controlling for cognitive factors. In addition to overstaying, we found that participants performed more suboptimally as reward decay rate increased, and that many participants expressed a heuristic preference for staying in the single best condition. Moreover, overstaying was strongly associated with higher scaling of stay durations to each condition, and this overstaying/scaling behaviour was positively associated with age but negatively associated with depressive symptoms. No associations were found between foraging behaviour and apathy. Together, our results suggest that people may counterproductively interpret staying in a patch as persistence in reward extraction, which would explain the tight link between overstaying but high sensitivity to reward conditions, and their association with depressive symptoms.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Decision-making is a fundamental cognitive process that involves selecting an action among alternatives based on expected costs and outcomes. Yet how individuals choose to maximise their gains or reward over time, and how much time and effort they are willing to invest in a task varies significantly. There are numerous factors -both within and across individuals -that influence decision-making. Across individuals, age influences decisionmaking, particularly in the context of risk or outcome uncertainty <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Eppinger et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Nassar et al., 2016)</ref>. Despite significant changes in reward processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Dhingra et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Eppinger et al., 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Eppinger et al., , 2013))</ref>, there does not seem to be a consistent change in behavioural response to reward in older adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Chowdhury et al., 2013)</ref>. Another factor influencing decision-making is apathy -that is, reduced motivation and diminished goal-directed behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Husain &amp; Roiser, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Levy &amp; Dubois, 2006)</ref>. Apathy is associated with a reduced willingness to invest effort for reward, both in healthy population and in various neuropsychiatric populations <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Chong et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Jurgelis et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Nair et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Saleh et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Treadway et al., 2009)</ref>, although mixed findings have been reported in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Valton et al., 2024)</ref>.</p><p>Foraging behaviour, a concept from ecological studies, has recently gained attention as a model for studying decision-making in different neuropsychiatric populations <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Barack, 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Barack et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bustamante et al., 2024)</ref>. In foraging tasks, participants decide when to stay with a current resource or 'patch' and when to switch to a potentially better one. Such paradigms can dissect components of decision-making, such as tendency to perseverate and responsiveness to continuous changes in reward, possibly with a more ecological experimental set-up. In humans, foraging studies have revealed that tonic dopamine levels may play a central role in deciding when to switch <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Constantino et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Le Heron et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Niv et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Raio et al., 2022)</ref>. Dopamine facilitates foraging or switching behaviours <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Le Heron et al., 2020)</ref>, possibly by enhancing the computed 'opportunity cost' <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Beierholm et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Niv et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Wolpe et al., 2024)</ref>.</p><p>Opportunity cost, or the forgone reward that is missed whilst engaging in the current course of action, is considered a key metric in the decision of whether and when to switch in foraging behaviour. In normative models, such as the Marginal Value Theorem (MVT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Charnov, 1976)</ref>, individuals are thought to switch between 'foraging' (~switch) and 'harvesting' ('stay') so as to maximise accumulated reward over time <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Stephens &amp; Krebs, 1986)</ref>. According to MVT, the optimal point for switching is when the rate at which reward is acquired falls below the potential average rewards of other available options <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Charnov, 1976</ref>). People's behaviour generally aligns with principles of MVT, though it is typically suboptimal <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Pearson et al., 2014)</ref>, as animals including humans tend to overstay in a given patch <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Harhen &amp; Bornstein, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Kendall &amp; Wikenheiser, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Kolling et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Le Heron et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Nonacs, 2001)</ref>. Several studies have investigated the sources of this suboptimality <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Garrett &amp; Daw, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Harhen &amp; Bornstein, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Kendall &amp; Wikenheiser, 2022)</ref>. However, it is unknown whether and how foraging behaviour changes across the lifespan in humans, and how it relates to key cognitive and mental health variables.</p><p>In this study, we investigated the relationship between foraging behaviour and three principal variables: age, depression, and apathy. We also measured processing speed and planning ability to control for potential cognitive confounds. Young and older participants completed a timed foraging task online, requiring them to collect as much reward as possible in the face of changing reward accumulation rate (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Participants also completed self-rated depression and apathy questionnaires, and two additional cognitive tasks to independently measure processing speed and planning ability as control. Based on the literature reviewed above, we hypothesised that older adults would show more suboptimal foraging behaviour due to increased perseveration and reduced sensitivity to changes in reward; that individuals with higher apathy would demonstrate reduced willingness to stay for diminishing rewards, and that depression would be associated with reduced reward sensitivity and earlier switching behaviour. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Optimal policies depended on initial reward rate and speed of decay</head><p>In order to understand how people should ideally behave in the foraging task, we first computed the optimal policy using optimization methods (see Methods). We found that optimal policies depended both on the initial reward rate and the speed of decay, with the high reward rate-slow decay condition (High-Slow) prescribing the maximal stay duration 7.5 s and the low reward rate-fast decay condition (Low-Fast) prescribing the minimal stay duration of 2.5 s. The two intermediate conditions had similar optimal policies, with 4.1 s for Low-Slow and 3.8 s for High-Fast. Given these large differences between all but the intermediate conditions, we expected the optimal policy would be learned quickly by most participants.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants differentiated conditions and showed several forms of suboptimality</head><p>Participant behaviour differed across conditions in accordance with normative predictions (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>). Group means differed significantly between pairs of conditions (two-tailed paired ttests; t(316) <ref type="bibr">=22.9, 22.2, 14.8; p=3.8e-85, 2.5e-2, 5.4e-43</ref> for the three adjacent ordered comparisons starting with High-Slow vs. Low-Slow; d'=1.8, 0.2, and 0.9, respectively). Note that the two middle conditions have optimal stay durations within ~300 milliseconds of one another, and, consistent with this, average participant responses were similar across those conditions. As a result, individual participants did not always stay longer in the Low-Slow (slightly better) condition than the High-Fast (slightly worse) condition. Importantly, compared to optimal behaviour, most participants exhibited overstaying behaviour (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>), and this had a substantial impact on total reward in the task (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref>). Group mean stay durations were substantially longer than those of an optimal agent, with mean overstaying of 2.6 s, 1.6 s, 1.6 s, and 1.7 s for the High-Slow, Low-Slow, High-Fast and Low-Fast conditions. Overstaying compared to an optimal agent was significant for all conditions (twotailed one sample t-tests; t(316) <ref type="bibr">=16.9, 13.0, 20.5, and 23.8; p=6.6e-46, 2.8e-31, 6.3e-60, and 2.5e-72; d'=1.0, 0.7, 1.2, and 1.4)</ref>.</p><p>A second primary determinant of reward in the task was response latency (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2C</ref>), which was correlated with total reward , but was unrelated to average stay durations <ref type="bibr">p=0.8)</ref>. Moreover, similar to stay duration, participant exit thresholds (their reward rates at exit time) were roughly half to three-quarters of the optimal values (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2D</ref>) (optimal threshold: 0.44 L/s; average thresholds: 0.30, 0,35, 0.27, 0.25). Notably, we observed that participants overstayed more in some conditions than others. Specifically, participants performed more optimally in the two slow decay-rate conditions, whereas they overstayed the most in the worst (low-fast) condition (compare red to black in figures 2D and 2E). This tendency cannot be simply explained by a fixed overstay duration pattern, as optimal stay durations were similar in the intermediate-quality (Low-Slow and High-Fast) conditions, whereas participants overstayed differently in these conditions. As a result, overstaying behaviour (measured as exit threshold differences) was distinct across task conditions (two-sided paired sample t-test, t(316) <ref type="bibr">=-9.7, 2.8, 6.4; p=8.5e-21, 1.3e-111, 3.5e-10; d'=-0.77, 2.21, 0.50, ordered as above)</ref>.</p><p>Examining individual participant exit thresholds in more detail, we computed each participant's variation around their own exit threshold baseline (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2E</ref>). This confirmed that individual participants tended to perform most suboptimally in the fast decay rate conditions, and most optimally on the Low-Slow condition. Many participants also overstayed in the High-Slow (best) condition more than in the Low-Slow (second best) condition. Participant suboptimality was therefore most pronounced in the fast decay rate conditions, over and above the (average) exit thresholds reflecting their generalised overstaying behaviour. One possible explanation for this may be that participants are less capable of approximating an internally defined exit threshold in the fast decay rate conditions (because of the higher rate of reward change, and perhaps an associated response lag) than in the slow decay rate conditions, but this would not explain the difference between high-slow and low-slow suboptimality. Notably, the differences between participants' highest and lowest exit thresholds were also significantly correlated with their average exit thresholds <ref type="bibr">(Pearson's r=0.65,</ref>; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2F</ref>), suggesting that the magnitude of this suboptimality difference is significantly related to the flattening reward rate curves at increasing stay durations. Better performing (more optimal) participants therefore had less consistent exit thresholds than poorer performing ones. Participants stayed for longer than they should in all conditions, but recovered the rank ordering correctly (as a group). Participants showing better performance also tended to cluster around the optimal for each condition, indicating that performing one condition correctly is associated with performing others correctly, whereas worse performance tended to affect all conditions. (B) Reward was strongly, but not entirely, determined by average stay durations. In particular, it was reduced by overstaying, which most participants exhibited, but also by under-staying, making the relationship nonlinear. (C) Response latency was a second significant determinant of total reward, and was not related (see the text) to total stay durations. (D) Participant exit thresholds, which show differential overstaying by condition, with the least overstaying in the Low-Slow condition and the most in the Low-Fast. (E) Exit threshold deviations (from by-participant grand means) for each condition. Having a higher exit threshold deviation is generally better (less suboptimal). A minority of participants were in the vicinity of optimal performance, or even under-stayed, and for these participants, this higher-is-better interpretation will not always be correct.</p><p>Participants can be seen to perform most suboptimally in the Low-Fast condition, followed by the High-Fast, High-Slow, and lastly, Low-Slow condition. (F) Participants with larger differences between their highest and lowest exit threshold, i.e., who had less consistent exit thresholds, had higher average exit thresholds and performed better on the task.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants differed in overstaying behaviour</head><p>To further examine how participants' policies differed, we performed PCAs on stay durations and exit thresholds. The first two principal components explained 90%, and 8% of the variance in stay durations across participants, respectively, and we obtained similar results for exit threshold PCs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A</ref>). The first PC (PC1) represented a combination of average stay duration shifting and scaling (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3B-C</ref>). Specifically, PC1 loaded positively on all stay durations, indicating baseline (or average) offsets between participants, but increased more for the "better" two conditions than the "worse" ones, indicating scaling or exaggeration of the between-condition stay durations. We found this to be a consequence of transforming approximately uniform exit threshold variations into duration space. In particular, the exit threshold variation (PC1 in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3C</ref>) implied greater stay duration variability in the slowdecay conditions (PC1 in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3B</ref>) and vice versa.</p><p>Overstaying behaviour therefore had two components: a baseline stay duration offset (relative to the optimal set of stay durations), and a condition-difference exaggeration component. Examining this decomposition further, we computed participant's offset components by taking mean stay durations, and computed their scale components by projecting mean-subtracted stay durations onto a mean-subtracted, unit-normed transform of the optimal policy. These components were highly correlated <ref type="bibr">(Pearson's r=0.69,</ref>, suggesting that participants that overstayed more, tended to exaggerate condition differences as well (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3D</ref>).</p><p>In contrast to PC1, the second PCs in both stay duration and exit threshold spaces measured a tendency to stay in the best (High-Slow) condition over all others (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3B-C</ref>).</p><p>Therefore, systematic variation between participants was dominated by differences in their baseline overstaying behaviour and scaling (PC1: baseline stay or overstay and scaling) and their expressed preferences for the single best patch in the task (PC2: High-Slow preference). In subsequent analyses, where possible, we chose to primarily analyse participant stay behaviour in stay duration space rather than exit threshold space, since the two were strongly related, and exit reward-rates asymptoted to zero as stay durations increased (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3E</ref>).</p><p>Differences in overstaying and scaling (PC1) were strongly related to total reward earned in the task. In line with the strong impacts of average policy stay durations across conditions, participants with lower PC1 scores tended to earn more reward  (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3F</ref>). When breaking PC1 down to baseline overstaying and scaling, the correlation between PC1 and reward was largely driven by a strong relationship between overstaying and reward , whereas there was no association between scaling and reward, independent of the relationship with overstaying (when scaling residualised by baseline overstaying, Pearson's r=-0.01, p=0.89). Similarly, the orthogonal aspect of preference for the best task condition (PC2) did not meaningfully impact participants' earned rewards (Pearson's r= 0.02; p=0.73). The remainder of reward variation was due in large part to response latency differences, as noted above, and consistency differences over the course of the task, to which we turn next. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Task performance was consistent over time</head><p>To assess whether our task measures were stable over the course of the experiment, we examined split-halves of our data. Recomputing PCs using the initial and final data segments, we observed strong agreement over the course of the task for both PC1 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4A</ref>) and PC2 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4B</ref>) (cosine angles: 3.0 and 2.9 degrees for PC1 and PC2 initial vs. final).</p><p>Similarly, the profile of exit deviations (computed as above) was conserved (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4C</ref>), although there was a notable increase in the relative optimality of participants' responses to the Low-Slow condition over the task (start vs end bars, Low-Slow group, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4C</ref>). In addition to PC stability, participants' initial and final scores were high correlated for both PC1 (Pearson's r=0.80, p=1.5e-72, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4D</ref>), and PC2 (Pearson's r=0.57, p=4.4e-29, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4E</ref>).</p><p>Exit deviations were correlated at a range of values between about 0.3 and 0.6 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4F</ref>).</p><p>Taken together, these results therefore indicated that both group factor structure and individual participant scores reliably reflected suboptimality over the duration of the task. To assess the unique contributions of these variables to differences in foraging behaviour, we fit several linear regression models. First, we residualised our task-exogenous variables by age, as age was significantly associated with all variables (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5A</ref>). These variables were then entered into two regression analyses, predicting PC1 and PC2. In the first regression model (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5B</ref>), age and PHQ scores showed significant associations with PC1 (β=0.13, -0.21; SE=0.06, 0.07; t(274)=2.3, -3.50; p=0.02, 0.003, for age and PHQ-9, respectively). By contrast, none of the variables was associated with PC2 in the second regression model (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5C</ref>).</p><p>Post hoc zero-order correlations showed there was a positive association between PC1 and age (r=0.20, p=4.3e-4, uncorrected; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5D</ref>), a negative association with PHQ (r=-0.13, p=0.025, uncorrected; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5E</ref>). For completeness, we also illustrate the positive association between PC1 and response times in the Tower of London task (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5F</ref>), which was interestingly abolished when residualising by age. Considering the high correlation between offset and scaling behaviour (see above), these analyses meant that older adults (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5D</ref>) and those with lower depression scores (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5E</ref>) showed both a greater tendency to overstay and greater scaling to each reward condition. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>The present study investigated the structure of suboptimal behaviour in a foraging task, and the correlates of this structure with plausible task-and individual-related factors. Our results indicate that suboptimality in foraging behaviour does indeed have more structure than perhaps previously discussed. Specifically, the most significant form of task suboptimality was overstaying, which was highly correlated with condition-specific scaling or sensitivity.</p><p>People who overstayed longer also adjusted their stay durations more across reward conditions. Interestingly, the simpler heuristic, namely preference for the best (High-Slow) condition further contributed to suboptimality (in the sense of deviating from the use of consistent exit thresholds). Across participants, overstaying/scaling was increased with age and decreased with depressive symptoms, while we could not isolate contributors to the preference for the single best task condition.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Suboptimality in foraging</head><p>As also reported in previous research, we found that most participants tend to consistently overstay in a patch, beyond what is predicted by normative models such as the MVT <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Kendall &amp; Wikenheiser, 2022)</ref>. Cognitive and motor mechanisms have been suggested for why people overstay in a patch compared to normative models. First, temporal discounting <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Kane et al., 2019)</ref> can make individuals overstay because leaving one source of reward incurs a cost in the form of a time delay before the next source of reward becomes available. This time delay spent on 'travelling' reduces the value of the future reward <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Kane et al., 2019)</ref>. Second, sensitivity to costs or effort in the task may contribute to overstaying, specifically in relation to costs incurred during travel to a different patch or while extracting reward within a patch (i.e., harvesting). Although we did not directly manipulate the effort involved in harvesting or travelling <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bustamante et al., 2023)</ref>, individuals may perceive the effort of harvesting by holding down the button and monitoring the filling milk bucket differently. Those who are less sensitive to this effort would exhibit more overstaying behaviour. Third, foragers need to infer the structure of their environment and use the uncertainty about this inferred structure to adjust their strategies <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Harhen &amp; Bornstein, 2023)</ref>. This means that future reward value is discounted by uncertainty about the environment, leading to overstaying behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Harhen &amp; Bornstein, 2023)</ref>. Fourth, overstaying can be explained by perseveration -whether cognitive or motor <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Sombric &amp; Torres-Oviedo, 2021)</ref> that is, the inappropriate, or in this case suboptimal, prolongation of behaviours (sometimes termed 'continuous perseveration' <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Sandson &amp; Albert, 1984)</ref>).</p><p>Interestingly, we found that the tendency to overstay ('offset') was highly correlated with condition-specific exaggeration of stay durations ('scale'). In other words, participants who tended to overstay for longer, were also more sensitive to changes in the reward conditions. This suggests that overstaying tendency cannot be simply explained by a reduced attention to the task or general slowness, which was indeed not associated with this behavioural pattern in our study. Instead, people who tend to stay longer may place a greater subjective value on extracting reward from each condition, which also makes them more sensitive to differences between conditions. That is, people may suboptimally perceive (over)staying as persistence in the task, and hence those who are more engaged and reward-driven may counterproductively overstay in each patch. This interpretation is consistent with the negative association between overstay/scaling and depression (see below).</p><p>Another important observation in our study is the differential effects of initial reward rate and reward decay rate on stay durations. Classical theories like the Marginal Value Theorem (MVT) typically focus on optimal exit thresholds as a function of current reward rates relative to average environmental rewards, without considering the specific factors that contribute to the instantaneous reward rate. However, we found that the initial reward rate and decay rate have differential influence on suboptimality in foraging behaviour. Specifically, we found that participant exit thresholds were not only consistently lower than optimal across all conditions, but the extent of this deviance from suboptimally was dependent on the specific reward condition: participants were more suboptimal in the fast decay-rate conditions compared to the slow decay-rate conditions, while initial reward rate had no consistent effect on suboptimality.</p><p>This pattern suggests that participants did not effectively adapt to conditions with rapidly diminishing rewards. This may highlight a limitation in cognitive flexibility or suggest that individuals favour stability in their reward-seeking behaviours, even in environments that would benefit from more agile adjustments. Moreover, this finding aligns with research on reinforcement learning and decision-making, which suggests that individuals may rely on heuristics or learned expectations rather than constantly recalibrating their behaviour to account for rapid changes in reward contingencies <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Niv et al., 2007)</ref>. The adoption of simple heuristics is further supported by our finding that some variability of foraging behaviour in our task was explained by preference for the best condition or patch.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Age-related differences in foraging behaviour</head><p>Consistent with our expectations, older adults demonstrated a greater tendency to overstay in a patch compared to younger adults. This was evidenced by a reduced exit threshold and an increased baseline stay tendency after accounting for sensitivity to reward. These findings align with previous literature suggesting that ageing is associated with increased perseveration as seen in rule-switching tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Daigneault et al., 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Haaland et al., 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Head et al., 2009)</ref>. Such perseveration may reflect a resource rational response to increased computational costs associated with cognition in the ageing brain, which in other work have been shown to give rise to both perseverative and anchoring biases that are amplified in older adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bruckner et al., 2020)</ref>. Alternatively, a tendency to overstay in older adults can reflect age-related risk <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Mata et al., 2011)</ref> or loss aversion <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Guttman et al., 2021)</ref>, where it is perceived as 'safer' to stick to the same action. Relatedly, when learning the statistics of an environment, older adults are thought to underestimate uncertainty about outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Nassar et al., 2016)</ref>, which would, according to certain foraging models <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Harhen &amp; Bornstein, 2023)</ref>, lead to earlier switches rather than overstaying behaviour. Directly manipulating environmental reward uncertainty in a future study would resolve these alternative hypotheses.</p><p>The high correlation between overstaying and sensitivity to reward conditions in our task meant that although older adults generally waited longer until they decided to switch, they remained highly responsive to the declining value of a resource over time. This heightened sensitivity could be an adaptive response to their overall tendency to stay in a patch, allowing them to reach similar levels of reward to that of young adults over time. Moreover, increased sensitivity to reward decay speaks to a large body of literature looking at reward processing in ageing <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Cutler et al., 2022)</ref>. Previous research has shown that reward processing changes in the brain across the lifespan <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Dhingra et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Eppinger et al., 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Eppinger et al., , 2013))</ref>, but behaviourally, there are no clear age-related changes in reward sensitivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Chowdhury et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Cutler et al., 2022)</ref>. The lack of a consistent behavioural change could be related to the inconsistent age-related changes in dopamine <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Chowdhury et al., 2013)</ref>. Dopamine has been suggested to control responsiveness to reward in the decision to switch <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Constantino et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Le Heron et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Niv et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Raio et al., 2022)</ref>. Specifically, dopamine drives switching behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Constantino et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Raio et al., 2022)</ref>, particularly in low-reward or 'poor' environments <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Le Heron et al., 2020)</ref>, and it has been suggested that tonic levels of dopamine reflect average reward rate <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Niv et al., 2007)</ref>.</p><p>Thus, a simplistic interpretation of our finding could be that overstaying behaviour in older adults is related to lower tonic dopamine levels. However, this interpretation would need to be reconciled with the finding of increased sensitivity to reward decay rate in older adults, which is in turn thought to be more related to phasic dopamine levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Niv et al., 2007)</ref>.</p><p>Future studies could more specifically test these hypotheses, for example in groups of patients with Parkinson's disease where tonic dopamine is primarily affected <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Le Heron et al., 2020)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Relationship to apathy and depression</head><p>Contrary to one of our hypotheses, we did not find a significant correlation between overstaying/scaling behaviour and apathy, as measured using the AES. This is in contrast to previous research linking apathy to the opportunity cost of time <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Nair et al., 2021)</ref>; to temporal discounting and impulsivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Fellows &amp; Farah, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Lansdall et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Petitet et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Sinha et al., 2013)</ref>; to perseveration <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Kim et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Scholl et al., 2022)</ref>; and to an inflated sensitivity to effort <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Dalléry et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Husain &amp; Roiser, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Jurgelis et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Le Heron et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Müller et al., 2021)</ref> (but see <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Valton et al., 2024)</ref>).</p><p>Interestingly, another recent study found no significant relationship between task parameters in an effort foraging task and apathy, although measured using a different apathy scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bustamante et al., 2023)</ref>. Moreover, a second reported only a weak association between AES and choice bias in an effort-reward decision-making task, but no association between AES and effort or reward sensitivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Mehrhof &amp; Nord, 2024)</ref>. Still another study reported no association between AES and behavioural parameters in an effort-reward decision-making task <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Valton et al., 2024)</ref>.These studies raise the possibility that in the general population, where changes in apathy scores are more subtle than in clinical populations, and where the meaning and validation of clinical scales such as the AES are less established, associations with task parameters can be weak.</p><p>In contrast to the lack of association between foraging behaviour and apathy in our study, we found a negative association between overstaying/scaling and depressive symptoms, as measured by the PHQ-9. This association indicates that individuals with more depressive symptoms tended to stay in a patch for a shorter duration. This finding is consistent with our interpretation that overstaying in the task could be seen as persistence (see above). On this account, more depressed individuals experience lower subjective value for extracting reward in each patch, leading them to switch earlier and have lower exit thresholds than those with less depressive symptoms. This result is also consistent with theories of lower average reward expectations in depression <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bustamante et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Huys et al., 2015)</ref>. Moreover, a reduced scaling or reward sensitivity (tightly linked to overstaying in our task) aligns with existing research showing diminished reward sensitivity in individuals with depression <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Halahakoon et al., 2020)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Strengths and limitations</head><p>The strengths of our study include the use of a new time-constrained foraging task, together with cognitive tasks looking at processing speed and executive function. When measuring more complex behaviours with new tasks, and especially when testing differences between different populations, such as older adults or patient groups, it is crucial to consider new tasks in conjunction with well-established measures of robustly identified cognitive traits, as we did here. However, our study has several notable limitations. First, the study was crosssectional, and our age-related results could not assess longitudinal changes with age.</p><p>Moreover, we used a simple foraging task that could potentially be applied to clinical populations with varying degrees of cognitive impairments. However, this meant that the task was more limited in what it could measure, as for example only one environment was included, and we did not manipulate effort or background reward rate as has been elegantly done before <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bustamante et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Le Heron et al., 2020)</ref>. Lastly, this study was largely descriptive, and a more mechanistic account of task-related behavioural differences would, of course, be preferable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>Our principal findings indicate that suboptimal foraging behaviour arises from multiple behavioural factors, including a general tendency to overstay in a patch, difficulties adapting to rapid changes in reward rate, and the use of simple heuristics, such as a preference for a single best patch. Moreover, age and less depressive symptoms were associated with a tendency to overstay, suggesting that overstaying may reflect heightened engagement with reward extraction rather than simply suboptimal decision-making. further exclusions by computing robust z-scores of stay durations, response latencies, stay duration PCA scores, and total reward, then removing participants falling outside of 3 robust SDs on these measures (a robust SD being defined as 1.48 times the median absolute deviation). These exclusions are shown on rank-value plots in Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. Our exclusion criterion can be considered lenient, because it translates into an average stay duration threshold of over 10 seconds and an average latency threshold of over 1 second.</p><p>Many of the participants who failed one of these tests also failed multiple of them, as can be seen in Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. Ultimately, our 3-SD outlier exclusion rule removed 31 participants from our foraging analyses, for a retention of 91% of the data, 317/350 participants for the main behavioural analyses.</p><p>For analysing the associations between task performance and age and mental health variables, we further excluded participants who either failed attention check questions on the AES or PHQ-9, or had implausible mean response times on the reaction time task. The implausible response times were also determined according to the 3-SD criterion, which translated into a threshold of approximately 1200 ms. Most participants failing this criterion had reaction times longer than 2.5 seconds, with some reaching 15 seconds. As a result, these set of analyses included 274 participants, comprising 78% of the original dataset.</p><p>In our analyses, we first computed the optimal policy for the task, by using the SciPy optimisation package, maximising reward with respect to stay durations. We defined a reward function mirroring that used in the task, which was parameterised by a fixed total experiment time of 6e5 ms, an inter-patch travel time of 4000 ms, the experimental rates of return for each condition, and a fixed response latency of 650 ms across all patches (roughly the median participant latency, which has no effect the optimal policy within reasonable bounds, as opposed to the total reward). Optimisation used an initial policy estimate with stay durations of 6 s, 5 s, 4.5 s and 3.5 s, and was robust to changes in this initialisation.</p><p>To examine the structure of foraging behaviour, we conducted Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on stay durations and exit thresholds, where exit thresholds were the patch reward rate at the time people switched patches. The first two principal components (PC1 and PC2) were used in subsequent analyses. We decomposed PC1 into 1) baseline stay duration offset, measuring how much longer a participant stayed compared to optimal durations. This was calculated as the mean stay duration across all conditions; 2) condition-difference scaling, measuring how much a participant exaggerated the differences between conditions. This was calculated as the projection of mean-subtracted stay durations onto the normalised optimal policy.</p><p>To assess task measure stability, we computed split-half reliability by comparing PCAs and exit deviations between first and second halves of the experiment. Correlations between halves were calculated using Pearson's r for PC scores and rank correlations for exit deviations.</p><p>Finally, we investigated the relationships between foraging behaviour and age, AES, and PHQ-9, while controlling for cognitive variables. We first residualised task exogenous variables against age, before entering them into two separate linear regression models, predicting PC1 and PC2. This allowed us to identify independent contributions of each variable, while controlling for cognitive performance. Statistical significance was assessed at α=0.05, with specific p-values reported for key comparisons. Effect sizes were reported as Cohen's d for group comparisons and Pearson's r for correlations.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Schematic of foraging in the milkman task.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>We recruited participants through the Prolific platform (https://www.prolific.co/). Screening criteria included age of 18-45 years for the young adult group and 65+ years for the older adult group, no chronic condition/illness, and no ongoing mental health/illness/condition.</p><p>Participants also had to pass a colour-blind test. All participants were asked to read the study information pages and to confirm they are eligible to participate and their consent to participate in the experiment. Participants were paid £4.50 (approximately £9 an hour rate), which included a fixed £1 bonus (see below). The study was approved by the Tel Aviv University local ethics committee <ref type="bibr">(ref: 0003132)</ref>.</p><p>Power analysis showed that with a 2:1 young-to-older adult group ratio, and a sample size of 230 young adults and 115 older adults, the study would have &gt;95% powered to detect significant associations between foraging performance and the variables of interest: age, depression and apathy in two regression analyses (see below), while controlling for the three cognitive variables (see below), with f2=0.15, ɑ=0.05/2. We therefore recruited 235 young adult participants (96 female) with a mean age = 30.81 years and SD = 5.79 years (age range 19-42 years) and 120 older adult participants (54 female) with a mean age = 69.26 years and SD = 3.81 years (age range 65-80 years).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental procedures</head><p>Participants performed three behavioural tasks and two questionnaires. The tasks examined foraging behaviour (milkman task), basic processing speed (choice reaction time task), and executive function or planning abilities (Tower of London task).</p><p>Milkman task: Inspired by <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Le Heron et al., 2020)</ref>, we developed a task that operationalises the decision to switch in a time constrained experiment (Fig. <ref type="figure">1A</ref>). Participants were asked to collect as much milk as possible in a 10-minute experiment. To incentivise them, they were informed that only those ranked in the top third in terms of total amount of milk collected would receive a bonus payment of £1.</p><p>To milk a cow, participants held down the spacebar key while a bucket, representing the accumulating milk, was displayed on the screen ('milking screen'). They were informed that as milking continued, it would become increasingly difficult to obtain milk from a cow. In reality, the milk accumulation rate followed an exponential function (Fig. <ref type="figure">1B</ref>) of the form:</p><p>Where 𝑁 (") is milk accumulation rate at time t, and 𝑁 0 is the initial accumulation rate and 𝜆 is the milk accumulation decay rate. The total milk accumulated (Fig. <ref type="figure">1C</ref>), as shown in the bucket, reflected the closed-form integral of this function. 𝑁 0 was taken from the set {0.01, 0.02} and 𝜆 from the set {2e -4 , 4e -4 }, creating a 2x2 design and four cows 'types' or conditions with high/low initial reward rate and fast/slow reward decay rate: High-Slow, High-Fast, Low-Slow, Low-Fast. Conditions were interleaved and pseudorandomly presented, such that each cycle of four consecutive trials contained each condition.</p><p>After releasing the spacebar, participants saw a 'travel screen', where they were told the next cow was being prepared for milking. Travel time was fixed at 4 s, and a progress bar was displayed showing the remaining time for the travel screen. On the travel screen, participants could see how much milk was added to their total. Participants were discouraged from pressing the spacebar key during the travel screen, and if premature pressing occurred, they received a warning on the screen which appeared for 2 s.</p><p>Throughout the experiment (during both milking and travel screen), time remaining was displayed as a countdown timer, as well as the total milk acquired so far. The experiment began with a 1-minute practice to familiarise participants with the task.</p><p>Mental health scale. To investigate the relationship between foraging, depression, and apathy, in addition to the foraging task, participants completed two scales: Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES) <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Marin et al., 1991)</ref> was used to examine individual differences in apathy symptoms. In addition, we evaluated depressive symptoms to control for depression, which typically correlates with apathy, by using the nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Kroenke et al., 2001)</ref>. We included two attention check items per questionnaire in the format of nonsensical or 'infrequency' items <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Zorowitz et al., 2023)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Control cognitive tasks. Choice reaction time task:</head><p>In the choice reaction time task, two empty circles were displayed horizontally on the screen. After a pseudorandom interval of 1-5 s (drawn from uniform distribution), one of the circles turned black, and participants were asked to press the left or right arrow key as fast as they can, if the left or right circles turned black, respectively. There were 50 trials overall, and the task took approximately 5 minutes.</p><p>The measure of interest for each participant was median reaction time in ms, as overall accuracy (whether the button pressed corresponded to the circle turning black) was at ceiling (minimum 89% across individuals, with median accuracy of 100% across individuals).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Tower of London task:</head><p>In the Tower of London task <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Shallice et al., 1997)</ref>, participants were instructed to move coloured discs, one by one, from a 'start state' depicted in one image, to match a 'goal state' depicted in another image. The discs are stacked vertically across three positions, with different configurations in each trial. During three practice trials, participants indicated the required number of moves to reach the goal state and then demonstrated these moves using a mouse. Only after correctly indicating and performing the moves did participants proceed to the experimental trials. In the 20 experimental trials, participants had 20 seconds to indicate the number of moves needed, without having to demonstrate the moves. The task was designed similarly to that in the Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Keefe et al., 2008)</ref>: It was terminated after five incorrect responses, and conversely, participants who were correct on all 20 trials completed two additional trials. The measure of interest was the total number of correct responses in the experimental trials.</p></div>
