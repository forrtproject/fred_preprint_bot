<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Over the last decades, policymakers in Europe and across the globe have grappled with major displacement crises that have resulted in a significant increase in the number of refugees fleeing conflict and persecution. Western destination countries face a significant challenge in designing policies and programs that facilitate the integration of refugees into the host country's economy and society <ref type="bibr">(OECD, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">UNHCR, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Council of the European Union, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">The Economist, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Degler and Liebig, 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Given that refugees are often unfamiliar with the host country's language, one of the key policy challenges involves the provision of language training programs <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Scholten et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Liebig, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Dumont et al., 2016)</ref>. Language acquisition is often the first step in the successful integration of refugees and serves as a vehicle for finding employment <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Dustmann and Fabbri, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Chiswick and Miller, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Cortes, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Dribe and Lundh, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">SchÃ¶nwÃ¤lder et al., 2005)</ref>. Proficiency in the host country's language can facilitate labor market integration through at least three channels. First, language is a fundamental element of human capital <ref type="bibr">(van Tubergen et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Dustmann and Fabbri, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Chiswick and Miller, 1995)</ref>. Second, language complements and enhances the transferability of skills obtained abroad in the host country labor market <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Berman et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Chiswick and Miller, 2001)</ref>. Third, employers and refugees in Europe often state that the lack of sufficient language skills is one of the main obstacles to employability, even for low-skilled jobs <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Degler and Liebig, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Fasani et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>These findings suggest that early investments in language courses for refugees shortly after arrival may subsequently yield substantial returns in terms of improved economic integration <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bach et al., 2017)</ref>. By improving economic integration, early language training might generate significant economic benefits, not only for refugees, who could more quickly find jobs that match their skill set but also for the host economy, in terms of higher tax contributions from employed refugees and lower welfare expenditures for unemployed refugees.</p><p>Between 2015 and 2017, nearly all OECD countries offered publicly financed language programs for refugees. Considerable variety existed, however, regarding the content of the programs and the number of instruction hours. As Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> shows, the maximum course hours ranged from 70 in Croatia to 4,800 or more in Scandinavian countries <ref type="bibr">(Denmark, Norway, and Sweden)</ref>. Programs also varied on several other dimensions, such as how soon after arrival refugees could enroll in the programs, whether instruction followed a standardized curriculum, whether certificates were offered, and whether there were national standards for course providers <ref type="bibr">(OECD, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Konle-Seidl, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Robert Bosch Stiftung, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">SchÃ¶nwÃ¤lder et al., 2005)</ref>.</p><p>Max. number of hours No data &lt;400 401-800 801-1200 1201-2400 2401-4800 No limit</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>: Maximum number of hours of public language courses in European countries around 2017. There is considerable heterogeneity in the maximum number of hours of language instruction refugees receive, ranging from 70 hours in Croatia to an unlimited number of hours in countries such as Denmark and Sweden. Data according to authors' communication with <ref type="bibr">UNHCR and OECD (2016)</ref>.</p><p>But do early language training programs for refugees actually improve their subsequent economic integration? And if so, what quantity and quality of instruction are required to achieve measurable improvements in economic integration? A sizable literature has documented strong links between language skills and improved labor market prospects for immigrants more generally <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Chiswick, 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Lubotsky, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Cohen and Haberfeld, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Berman et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Bleakley and Chin, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Delander et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Dustmann and Fabbri, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Hayfron, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Lochmann et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Chiswick and Miller, 2001)</ref>. However, there exists much less evidence on the impact of language training programs for refugees in particular.</p><p>Perhaps the studies closest to ours are <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Foged et al. (2022)</ref> and Foged and Van der Werf (2023), which both consider language programs for refugees that arrived in Denmark. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Foged et al. (2022)</ref> evaluate a policy reform that increased the number of hours of language training and made training mandatory for refugees who arrived in Denmark after January 1, 1999. The policy change was accompanied by some other features introduced with the same cutoff, including a temporary reduction in welfare benefits and a new scheme for placing refugees in municipalities. Using a regression discontinuity design the study finds that the policy as a whole increased the employment probabilities by around 4 percentage points and led to higher earnings. At the cutoff refugees accumulated around 200 hours of additional language training. Foged and Van der Werf (2023) leverages variation in the accessibility of local language training centers in Denmark to examine the impact of language classes for refugees on language fluency. The study finds that an additional 100 hours of language instruction improved refugees Danish language fluency by around 8-9 percent, looking at refugees who arrived from 2003 to 2013. The study also finds that language classes reduced the probability that refugees leave the localities in which they are initially placed.</p><p>Our study differs from previous work in that we examine the impact of language training programs on refugees labour market integration in Germany in the context of a major displacement crisis characterized by mass arrivals. In particular, we leverage register population data to provide evidence on the impact of a large-scale language training program that the German government rapidly developed and implemented in response to the large increase in refugees in 2015. We find no discernible effect of this program on refugee employment over the following 22 months. To shed light on the question whether language programs are generally ineffective during refugee crisis, we contrast this null finding with the impacts of a more comprehensive, preexisting yet smaller-scale program. Using a variety of difference-indifferences estimators, we find that this preexisting program increased refugee employment by about between 4-5 percentage points 12 months after enrollment. Our contrasting findings illuminate the nuanced impacts of early language training programs during a period when a large number of refugees arrived. Understanding these impacts is crucial for informing the design of language policies in Germany and beyond, and for preparing for future crises.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Language Training and Refugee Integration</head><p>Research has shown that refugees experience significant employment and wage gaps compared to other immigrant groups and the native population, even many years after arrival <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Fasani et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Cheng et al., 2021)</ref>. Studying early language training programs for refugees during times of crisis is important, as refugees face many additional challenges compared to immigrants who migrate voluntarily through mechanisms like family reunification or for study and work <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Becker and Ferrara, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Liebau and Schacht, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Robert Bosch Stiftung, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Beiser and Hou, 2000)</ref>.</p><p>First, refugee crises are marked by large numbers of arrivals, leading to prolonged asylum processing times. This results in extended uncertainty about the prospects of staying in the host country, overcrowded accommodations, overburdened support programs, higher unemployment rates among refugees, and often, political backlash against new arrivals <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Hainmueller et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Fasani et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Hangartner et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Pecoraro et al., 2022)</ref>.</p><p>Second, many refugees have endured traumatic events in their home countries or during their journey to safety. The psychological impact of these experiences can impede their ability to focus on learning a new language, and the stress of resettlement and adjusting to a new culture can further hinder language acquisition <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Bjertrup et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Schlaudt et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Third, the language of the host country may be vastly different from the refugees' native languages, presenting a significant learning barrier <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Asfar et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Cheng et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>Fourth, refugees often have limited opportunities to practice the language outside formal learning settings. They may reside in reception centers where their native language predominates, or they may face discrimination or social isolation, which can further impede their engagement with the new language (Van Tubergen, 2010).</p><p>These factors can significantly obstruct both language acquisition and labor market integration for refugees, underscoring the importance of studying the returns to language training for this group. Early language training might be especially critical given the existing evidence of a formative early window for integration. Studies have demonstrated that interventions shortly after arrival-such as early access to labor markets, voting rights, shorter asylum wait times, or better matching between refugee characteristics and host communities-can durably improve immigrants' subsequent integration trajectory <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Hainmueller et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Marbach et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Ferwerda et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bansak et al., 2018)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Setting</head><p>In 2015/2016, Germany received over one million asylum seekers, a stark contrast to an average of 71,000 asylum applications per year during the period from 1995 to 2014 <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(BAMF, 2018)</ref>. A significant portion of these refugees were escaping conflict and persecution in countries such as Syria, Afghanistan, and Iraq. It is important to note that for the purposes of this study, we use the terms "refugees" and "asylum seekers" interchangeably. Within our estimation sample, most individuals initially enter as asylum seekers but later receive some form of humanitarian protection, thereby transitioning into refugee status.</p><p>Prior to the 2015 crisis, Germany relied on a language program offered by the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF). This program, called Integration Course (Integrationskurs) has been in operation since 2005 and is rather comprehensive in scope, covering up to 600 hours of instruction with a standardized curriculum. Between January 2015 and January 2017, approximately 500,000 individuals participated in the BAMF courses <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Deutscher Bundestag, 2016)</ref>. However, in the context of the mass arrivals of refugees during the same time period, this preexisting program struggled to meet the demand during the refugee crisis. Since scaling up the preexisting program proved challenging, policymakers established a novel, ad hoc language training program called Introductory German Language Course (Einstiegskurs zur DeutschfÃ¶rderung), administered by the Federal Employment Agency (BA).</p><p>This program was ambitious in scale and designed to promptly accommodate a large number of eligible participants from Syria, Iraq, Iran, and Eritrea. It took a less intensive approach, covering only 320 hours of instruction and lacking a standardized curriculum, and was rolled out rapidly. The first course began less than four weeks after announcement, in late October 2015. In total, about 230,000 refugees, approximately 38% of the eligible arrival population in 2015, enrolled in this program <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Bundesrechnungshof, 2017)</ref>, see Figure 2. The cost amounted to about 400 million Euros, or approximately 4.8 Euros per participant per training hour. Additional details on the two language training programs are provided in the Supplementary Materials (SM).</p><p>Comparing the ad hoc program to the distribution of course hours in other European countries (see Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>), we observe that the ad hoc program, with 320 hours, ranks towards the bottom of the distribution. In contrast, the preexisting course falls within the modal category of 600 hours. Despite being less intensive than the preexisting language course, the ad hoc program shared the goal of integrating refugees into the labor market <ref type="bibr">(BA Presseteam, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">BAMF, 2015)</ref>. However, there is scant evidence that this shift in design and delivery of language programs succeeded.</p><p>0 50 100 150 Jan-15 Jul-15 Jan-16 Jul-16 Jan-17 Total (in 1000) A: Refugee arrivals Jan-15 Jul-15 Jan-16 Jul-16 Jan-17 Program new ad hoc pre-existing B: Number of refugees starting language courses Figure 2: The left panel displays monthly registrations of refugee arrivals from Syria, Iraq, Iran, and Eritrea via the EASY-System (Erstverteilung der Asylbegehrenden-System) between January 2015 and January 2017. The right panel shows the number of refugees participating in the ad hoc language training program (orange bars). The vertical dashed line marks the cutoff date (December 31, 2015) for ad hoc program eligibility. For comparison, total enrollment in the preexisting language program is also displayed (green bars), with the last six months estimated based on the total number of courses starting. Sources: Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF) and Federal Employment Agency (BA). 4 Data, Measures, and Statistical Analysis 4.1 Data</p><p>We use monthly panel data compiled from the Integrated Employment Biographies (IEB) to study the impact of both programs on labour market integration. We combine the IEB data with another administrative individual data Statushistorik Zuwanderung (SHZ) that contains detailed information on socio-demographic characteristics and important migration-related information. This data is based on administrative records from the BA and allows us to cover almost all refugees who arrived in Germany.</p><p>We focus on refugees from Syria, Iran, Iraq, and Eritrea, with a observed and registered arrival date between June 2015 and June 2016, and ages 18 -35 at the time of arrival. Note that at the time refugees from these four origin countries who applied for asylum in Germany were considered to have a high probability of getting protection status and therefore eligible to participate in the language training programs and eligible to work.</p><p>To examine the effects of the ad hoc language training program we leverage the data on 210,369 refugees which we observe over approximately two years for a total of 5,487,256 person-months. Note that for about 96.8% of all refugees in the data, we have a record up until the last month in the panel, but about 3.2% drop before the end of the panel. In the robustness section below we examine the sensitivity of our results to this panel attrition.</p><p>To examine the effects of the comprehensive training program we use a random person sample of the population which includes 50,000 refugees <ref type="bibr">(1,335,073 person-months)</ref>. To enhance the comparability of estimates between the preexisting and the ad hoc programs we restrict this random sample to individuals who were eligible for the ad hoc program (i.e., individuals who arrived before <ref type="bibr">December 31, 2015)</ref>. The reason why we use a random sample is to reduce computational burden for the panel models.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Measures</head><p>Our main outcome measure of labor market integration is the binary variable 'Has job' which measures employment status. It is coded as one for refugees when they are in full-time or marginal employment in a given month and zero otherwise. Note that marginal employment includes all part-time, low-wage jobs (including low-paying "minijobs," apprenticeships, and paid internships). We also use two alternative outcomes. 'Has job (w/o minijob)' focuses only on full time employment and does not include any marginal employment. 'Has minijob' focuses only on marginal employment, respectively.</p><p>We also observe a limited set of covariates, including the age at arrival, a binary variable measuring education that takes the value of one if the individual completed more than primary school and zero otherwise, origin, and gender. More details on the data and measures is provided in the SM.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Descriptive Statistics</head><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">1</ref> shows descriptive statistics for the estimation samples. The columns on the left show the full population we use to examine the effects of the ad hoc program. The average refugee is 25 years old, the share of females is 25%, and the nationality shares are 73% Syrian, 16% Iraqi, 6% Iranian, and 5% Eritrean. 60% have some schooling.</p><p>The mean of the variable measuring enrollment in the preexisting language training program is only 2%. This low participation rate in the preexisting program demonstrates the limited capacity of this program to serve the large refugee population at the time and was the motivation for creating the large scale ad hoc program.</p><p>The mean for the 'has job' outcome is only 7% indicating that most refugees are unemployed. The columns on the right show the random person sample of the population eligible for the ad-hoc program we use to examine the effects of the preexisting program. This sample mirrors the full population we use to examine the effects of the ad hoc program with only very limited differences across covariates.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Identification and Estimation Strategy</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.1">RDD for Ad Hoc Program</head><p>To identify the effects of the ad hoc program, we leverage a regression discontinuity design (RDD) based on the criterion that only refugees from Syria, Iran, Iraq, and Eritrea who received their registration on or before December 31, 2015, were eligible to participate. This allows us to isolate the effect of program eligibility by comparing otherwise similar refugees who arrived just before this cutoff date to those who arrived just afterward in January 2016 and were ineligible. Note that refugees in our sample all had a strong incentive to register as soon as possible after their arrival in Germany in order to start the asylum application review and get access to rights and benefits. Therefore it seems unlikely that refugees would try to manipulate their arrival date around the cutoff. Indeed, results from placebo tests indicate that the covariates are well balanced at the threshold, consistent with a quasirandom assignment of eligibility around the cutoff date (see <ref type="bibr">SM Table S.2 and Figure S.1)</ref>.</p><p>To estimate the effect of the ad hoc program, we use a local linear regression with a triangular kernel of the form:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Y it = Î± + Î² 1 Z i + Î´D i + Î² 2 (D i * Z i ) + it</formula><p>where Y it measures the employment of refugee i in a specific month t after arrival, Z i is the running variable that measures the distance between the day of arrival and the eligibility cutoff date <ref type="bibr">(December 31, 2015)</ref>, D i is a treatment indicator coded one if the arrival was before the cutoff date and zero otherwise, and it is the error term.

In this model, Î³ i and Î¾ t are refugee and calendar month fixed effects that control for time-invariant refugee characteristics (such as education, employment experience acquired in the origin country, or time-invariant cognitive skills and personality traits) and common shocks that vary at the month level. The model also includes an interactive fixed effects component given by Î» i f t , where f t = [f t,1 , ..., f t,r ] is a (r Ã 1) vector of unobserved common factors and Î» i = [Î» i,1 , ..., Î» i,r ] is a (r Ã 1) vector of unknown factor loadings <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bai, 2009)</ref>.</p><p>The idea of the interactive fixed effects component is to capture time-varying unobserved confounders by allowing a set of refugee-specific fixed effects to interact with time-varying factors. For example, an unobserved common shock is allowed to have a heterogeneous impact on each refugee or alternatively, the effects of unobserved time-invariant refugee confounders can change over time. We allow for two factors (r = 2), such that the interactive fixed component is modeled by Î» i,1 f t,1 +Î» i,2 f t,2 . Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bai (2009)</ref>, we estimate this model using an iterative algorithm that applies a factor analysis to the residuals from a linear model and then re-estimates the linear model while incorporating the influence from a fixed number of the most important factors.

Let G i,g be a cohort indicator, coded as 1 if refugee i is first treated at time g, and zero otherwise. Cohorts are defined as groups of refugees who enroll in the same month. Let C be an indicator for a never-treated group, coded as 1 for refugees who never enroll and zero otherwise.

Panel A of Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> shows the average employment rates as a function of the distance between the arrival date and the program eligibility cutoff of December 31, 2015. If participation in the ad hoc language program led to increased employment, we would expect a higher rate of employment among those refugees who arrived right before the cutoff date and were therefore eligible for the ad hoc courses compared to those refugees who arrived right after that date and were therefore not eligible. However, we find that there is no drop in the average employment rates among those who arrived right after the cutoff date compared to those who arrived right before. This indicates that the ad hoc program had no discernible positive effect on enhancing the labor market participation of refugees for up to 22 months after arrival. Note that this null finding is not due to low program take-up among the eligible refugees. Indeed, as we show in the SM, the estimated program participation rate drops sharply by about 21 percentage points at the cutoff (see Figure <ref type="figure">S</ref>.2). Panel B in Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> shows the estimation results from the local linear regression, which identifies the employment effects of the ad hoc program at the cutoff date, measured from six to up to 22 months after arrival. The estimated optimal bandwidth is on average 28 days around the cutoff date (the underlying estimates are also presented in Table <ref type="table">S</ref>.3 in the SM). Consistent with the graphs in Panel A, we find that the program had no discernible positive effect on average employment rates. The point estimate for the effect 7 months after arrival is 0.03 with a narrow 95% confidence interval ranging from -0.34 to 0.40. For 12 months after arrival, the effect estimate is -0.00 with a 95% confidence interval of -0.75 to 0.75. For longer follow-up periods, the effects, if anything, turn more negative but also less precise. For month 17, the estimate is -0.92 with a 95% confidence interval from -2.17 to 0.33, and for month 22, the estimate is -2.01 with a confidence interval from -4.14 to 0.12. Note that for two of the months, 19 and 20, the effect estimates are negative and significant at the 95% confidence level, but the confidence intervals for those two months overlap with those of the null effect estimates for the other months, and this negative effect is also not robust across alternative specifications (see below).

Together, these tests suggest that we can rule out all but very small benefits of the program.</p><p>In the SM, we present results from various robustness checks that corroborate the main findings. First, we replicate the models to estimate the effects by employment type: all jobs, marginal employment, and jobs excluding marginal employment. We find no discernible effects across all employment types <ref type="bibr">(Figure S.4)</ref>. Second, we replicate the models but also adjust for covariates (age, nationality, schooling, and sex), and the estimates are similar, as expected given that they are balanced across the eligibility threshold <ref type="bibr">(Figure S.5)</ref>. Third, we check if the estimates are affected by attrition and replicate the main models while imputing a zero for all years post-arrival without an observed employment outcome (e.g. due to emigration out of Germany or death). The idea behind this imputation strategy is that any form of formal employment should be observed in our register data. We again find that the null effects are robust to this adjustment <ref type="bibr">(Figure S.6)</ref>. Fourth, we find that the null findings are not the result of a specific bandwidth or model specification <ref type="bibr">(Figure S.7)</ref>. Fifth, we find that the effects are robust when we use a (one-sided) donut regression discontinuity design that excludes observations to the left of the threshold <ref type="bibr">(Figure S.8)</ref>. Sixth, we check whether the null findings might be driven by the fact that those who are ineligible for the ad hoc program may subsequently enroll in the preexisting comprehensive training program. To do so, we replicate the models while excluding all individuals that at some point during our study period (also) enroll in the pre-existing program. Again, we find no discernible effects for the ad hoc program (Figure S.9). We also find no significant effect of the eligibility for the ad hoc program on the probability of enrolling in the pre-existing program <ref type="bibr">(Figure S.10)</ref>. Seventh, we estimate the results separately for men and women, and the results are similar, with slightly more variability for men <ref type="bibr">(Figure S.11)</ref>. Eighth, we estimate the ad hoc program broken down by refugees' state of residence at arrival. We find that there is some heterogeneity, but the distribution of effects is centered on zero and the null effects are robust across the large majority of states (Figure S.12). Lastly, we replicate the models broken down by refugees' education levels; we find some limited heterogeneity but the distribution of estimates centered on zero <ref type="bibr">(Figure S.13)</ref>.</p><p>The results so far have shown that the ad hoc, large-scale language training program rapidly established by the German government in response to the surge in refugees did not have any discernible impacts on the labor market integration of refugees on average. This raises two important questions: Are these null effects a consequence of specific features of this ad hoc program? Or do these findings indicate more general and systemic limitations of language programs' potential to foster economic integration during a large scale displacement crisis? To begin addressing these questions, we contrast the estimates from the ad hoc program with the effects of the much smaller scale preexisting language program during the same time period and in the same context.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Results: Effects of Preexisting Language Program</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref> displays the effect estimates for two estimators: the difference-in-differences imputation estimator with interactive fixed effect (top panel) and the doubly robust CS DR difference-in-differences estimator (bottom panel). The effects are shown for three outcomes: all jobs (left), all jobs but minijobs (middle), and minijobs (right). The underlying estimates are also presented in Table <ref type="table">S</ref>.4 and S.5 in the SM.</p><p>The results indicate that enrolling in the preexisting language course significantly increased employment following the six-month course duration. This result holds across both estimators. For instance, at month 12 following enrollment in the course, the estimated effect from the imputation estimator on the 'all jobs' outcome is an increase of 4.8 percentage points with a standard error of 0.9. The corresponding estimate from the CS DR estimator is an increase of 4.4 percentage points with a standard error of 0.9. The results in the middle and left panels suggest that the increase in employment in later periods is not primarily driven by minijobs. While the point estimates are similar up until month 14 (imputation estimator) and 15 (CS DR estimator) for the minijob outcome and the all jobs but minijobs outcome, the effects for the all jobs but minijob outcome continues to grow while it declines for the minijob outcome.</p><p>Consistent with the parallel trends assumption, there are no large differences in employment rates in the months prior to enrollment for all three outcomes. In Table <ref type="table">S</ref>.6 in the SM, we present F-tests for three selected pre-treatment periods (3 to 1 month before enrollment, 9 to 1 month, and 29 to 1 month) and all three employment outcomes. We observe one statistically significant difference in pre-treatment estimates across the three employment outcomes but the substantive magnitude of this difference is small, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>.</p><p>In the SM, we present several robustness checks that corroborate the main results. First, we re-estimate the CS DR estimator using the not-yet and the never-treated units as controls, and the estimates are very similar <ref type="bibr">(Figure S.14)</ref>. Second, we examine whether the results are affected by panel attrition by re-estimating the models while imputing any missing outcomes as zero, and the results are again similar <ref type="bibr">(Figure S.15)</ref>. Third, we re-estimate the models separately for male and female refugees. The effects are roughly similar across both males and females, with the estimates for women being somewhat elevated in magnitude but with larger confidence intervals due to the reduced estimation sample size <ref type="bibr">(Figure S.16</ref>). Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>: Top panel: Estimates of the effects of the preexisting language training program from difference-in-differences imputation estimator with interactive fixed effects for three outcomes: all jobs (left), all jobs but minijobs (middle), minijobs (right).

Overall the estimates suggest that the preexisting language program increased employment following the six months course duration.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Discussion</head><p>The results indicate that while the large-scale ad hoc program had no discernible effects on employment, the smaller-scale preexisting program led to considerable increases in employment. This latter finding refutes the hypothesis that language courses are generally ineffective in facilitating economic integration during times of large-scale displacement crises. However, the contrasting results raise a new question: Which program features account for their differential effectiveness? Without randomizing the different features of the programs, it is difficult to disentangle their individual contributions to the overall effect. Nonetheless, the two programs can be distinguished along several dimensions that past research has shown to be important for effectiveness, including the duration of the course <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Rolstad et al., 2005)</ref>, the provision of skill certificates <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Desiderio, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Pecoraro and Wanner, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Tani, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">BrÃ¼cker et al., 2021)</ref>, and the classroom composition <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Sprietsma and Pfeil, 2015)</ref>.</p><p>While the maximum class size was fairly similar between the two programs, the preexisting program was much longer, with 600 hours compared to only 320 hours in the ad hoc program. In addition, the preexisting program had a consistent curriculum, set standards for course providers, and provided successful course participants with a certificate they can show to potential employers. The ad hoc program lacked these features (see SM Table <ref type="table">S</ref>.1 for details).</p><p>Given these differences, it appears likely that the ad hoc program lacked the quality and quantity of instruction necessary for participants to acquire sufficient German proficiency that would translate into more success in the labor market. An alternative interpretation is that the program did lead to improved language skills, but the lack of certification meant that participants could not credibly signal those skills to potential employers. We hope that future research will be able to shed light on the relative impact of these and other program features.</p><p>It is also important to recognize that selection of refugees into the two programs may have contributed to the heterogeneous effects we find. When comparing the characteristics of the participants in the preexisting program with the rest of the sample, we observe that the participants in the preexisting program had a slightly higher share of Syrians and refugees with some education (SM Table <ref type="table">S</ref>.5). To the extent that the courses had a greater effect on refugees who are positively selected, this could partly explain why the preexisting program had more positive effects.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">Conclusion</head><p>Our findings carry important implications for the design of language policies and programs during periods of mass refugee displacement. Over the past decades, millions of displaced individuals have arrived in Europe and been granted refugee status and subsidiary protection. Mastering the host country's language is typically the first, and potentially most crucial, step toward successful integration into the host country's economy and society. While virtually all European host countries offer language programs, it remains unclear how best to expand their capacity during crises and periods of high demand.</p><p>Our results suggest that the ambitious initiative by policymakers in Germany to establish a large-scale, ad hoc language program meant that many refugees received basic language training shortly after arrival. However, ultimately, this program proved ineffective in improving their employment prospects. To investigate whether these null effects stem from particular features of the ad hoc program or arise from the general challenge of delivering effective language programs during refugee crises, we contrast our analysis with a preexisting, more comprehensive language course. We find that this program nearly doubled refugees' chances of employment. This indicates that more comprehensive programs can successfully facilitate labor market integration even during periods of large refugee arrivals and associated pressures on the asylum system and host communities.</p><p>Our findings regarding the divergent effects of the two programs highlight a significant trade-off in designing an effective response to refugee crises. While the preexisting program yielded high returns, it served far fewer refugees, whereas the ad hoc program reached more refugees but failed to generate discernible employment benefits. Ultimately, the null finding from the ad hoc program suggests that it prioritized quantity over quality in an effort to swiftly assist the maximum number of individuals. It appears that a more promising approach would involve investing in scaling up comprehensive programs that provide at least some employment benefits to participants, even if it means not everyone can be served immediately. Determining the optimal level of comprehensiveness for such investments remains an open and crucial question for future research.</p><p>Last but not least, it is important to recognize two limitations of the study. First, since there was no variation in the participation in the different components of the two programs, we could only evaluate the effects of the programs as they were rolled out in reality. While this evidence is of first-order policy importance, it does not quantify the relative returns to the different components of each program (e.g., course duration, certification, quality of instruction). Future research on this question would be important to help design optimal programs. Second, given our data limitations, we could only examine effects on employment outcomes. It is well understood that immigrant integration is a multi-dimensional concept that goes beyond economic success. To better inform policy debates, future research should examine the impacts on other important dimensions of refugee integration, such as linguistic, psychological, political, or social integration <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Harder et al., 2018)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">van Tubergen, F., I.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background on the Data</head><p>Our dataset is an individual-level monthly panel data of refugees and asylum-seekers. This dataset was constructed from the Integrated Employment Biographies (IEB) data of the Institute for Employment Research (IAB). The IEB draws on administrative sources of the German Federal Employment Agency (BA) and includes all individuals in Germany who either have an employment status subject to social security, a marginal part-time employment status, or are benefit recipients, officially registered as unemployed, or participants in active labor market programs. The data excludes employees of the state and self-employed individuals but since refugees are largely not allowed to become self-employed or unlikely to be employed by the state, this is of little consequence for our study. Based on an additional dataset, the Statushistorik Zuwanderung-SHZ, we also have information on the immigration status of all individuals in our data. Since states are reimbursed for some of the costs that they incur for hosting asylum-seekers, the Federal Employment Agency strives for a high data quality also for the immigration-related data that we use <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[3]</ref>.</p><p>Our analysis dataset consists of asylum seekers from Syria, Iran, Iraq, and Eritrea who arrived (and registered) between June 2015 and June 2016 and were 18-35 years old at the time of arrival. Since the date of arrival is only recorded for individuals that live outside of Optionskommunen, we exclude everyone living in any of these 104 counties and focus on individuals living in the remaining 297 counties. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> We also remove all refugees arriving on the first day of a month as the records of refugees whose exact arrival date was unknown were typically assigned the first of the month by default. Our main outcome measure of labor market integration is employment status (including marginal employment, apprenticeships and paid internships) in a given month. Marginal employment includes all part-time, low-wage jobs (GeringfÃ¼gig entlohnte BeschÃ¤ftigte, Kurzfristig BeschÃ¤ftigte and Niedriglohn in Gleitzone, 400-800 Euro).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background on Language Training Programs</head><p>At the core of the analysis are two public language training programs for refugees. The first language program refers to the ad hoc language course provided by the BA. After the federal government passed the legal amendment of the Article 421 of Social Code III ( Â§421 Sozialgesetzbuch III ) to allow the BA to provide quick and unbureaucratic language support for refugees, the BA introduced a temporary, basic language program for refugees (called Einstiegskurs zur DeutschfÃ¶rderung) <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[2]</ref>.</p><p>Access to the ad hoc language program was limited to asylum-seekers with valid proof of registration at course start (e.g., BÃ¼MA, Ankunftsnachweis or Aufenthaltsgestattung)<ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">foot_2</ref> and limited to persons from Syria, Eritrea, Iraq and Iraq (because they had a high probability of getting protection status). By law, course providers had to start the course before December 31, 2015 to receive reimbursement.</p><p>The second language training program refers to the preexisting and more comprehensive language course (Integrationskurs) offered by the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF). The comprehensive language program was introduced with the Immigration Act (Zuwanderungsgesetz ) in 2005 and includes language training (600 teaching hours) and training of German cultural and values (100 teaching hours). Refugees from Eritrea, Iran, Iraq, Syria or Somalia are allowed to participate in these courses while their asylum application is reviewed. After receiving some form of protection, refugees are typically required to participate in these courses if they have not already done so.</p><p>Table <ref type="table">S</ref>.1 details the content and the structure of both the ad hoc program and the preexisting language program. There are several differences between the two courses. The ad hoc program offered 320 hours of instruction compared to 600 hours in the preexisting program. The preexisting program also had a standardized curriculum developed by the Goethe-Institute and a final examination according to the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR). Successful participants obtained a language certificate for B1 language competency in writing, reading, speaking and conversation according to CEFR. In contrast, the ad hoc courses had no standardized curriculum and offered no certification.</p></div>

However, for the latter program, we received additional data based on paper records from the BA. This data includes the number of participants per course, information about when each course started, and which of the 40 local branches of the BA managed the paperwork. Yet, this data does not provide information on the arrival and registration dates of the participating refugees. Therefore, we collected a sample of 500 course registration records from participants in April 2018. This sample was randomly drawn from scanned course registration records available at the BA (In 61 of the sampled records, the paperwork was incomplete or unreadable, and the participant's registered arrival date could not be determined). To estimate the participation rate, we first use raking to post-stratify the random sample of participants by managing office and the week of course start. Next, we combine the estimated monthly participant counts with population data on the number of refugee arrivals from Syria, Iraq, Iran, and Eritrea in the EASY-System (Erstverteilung der Asylbegehrenden-System). Figure S.2 shows the estimated participation rates in the ad hoc program by refugees' date of registration in Germany. We find that the estimated program participation rate drops sharply by about 21 percentage points at the cutoff. Figure S.3 shows a binned scatter plot with the average waiting period (number of days between the beginning of the course and the registration date) by calendar week when the course starts. To estimate the average waiting period for each week, we use the post-stratified data. The fitted linear regression line suggests that the average waiting period does not systematically vary with the week when the course starts.</p><p>â¢ Main Effects for the RDD by Employment Type: Figure S.4 shows the estimates of the ad hoc program broken down by employment type: all jobs, marginal employment, and jobs excluding marginal employment. We see that the estimated effects are statistically insignificant across all employment types and months of residency. This holds regardless of whether we use the conventional or bias-corrected regression discontinuity estimator (with a common MSE-optimal bandwidth) <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">4]</ref>. This indicates that the null-finding is not an artifact of choosing a specific estimator.</p><p>â¢ Main Effects for the RDD Adding Covariates: Figure S.5 shows that there are also few differences between estimates adjusted for observed demographic covariates and unadjusted estimates. The covariates include: Age <ref type="bibr">(18-20, 21-25, 26-30, 31-35)</ref>, nationality (Syrian, Iraqi, Iranian, Eritrean), schooling (no, yes, missing), sex (female, male). This lack of sensitivity to the inclusion of covariates supports the identification assumption of the RDD.</p><p>â¢ Main Effects for the RDD Imputing for Attrition: In Figure S.6, we show the same estimates using the observed outcomes as well as imputed outcomes. The latter outcomes are constructed by imputing a zero for all years post-arrival without an observed employment outcome. The motivation for this imputation strategy is that any form of formal employment (other than self-employment) should be observed in the data. Unobserved outcome values could be, for example, due to emigration out of Germany or death. This indicates that the null-finding is not an artifact of panel attrition.</p><p>â¢ Main Effects for the RDD Varying the Bandwidth: Figure S.7 shows the main estimates for the employment effect of the ad hoc program on refugee employment by varying the bandwidth for the RDD and including polynomials of the running variable. We find that the null effect is similar across all specifications. If anything, we observe a negative effect of ad hoc program eligibility on employment for some of the specifications. This indicates that the null-finding is not an artifact of choosing a specific specification or bandwidth.</p><p>â¢ Main Effects for the RDD with Donut Exclusion: Figure S.8 shows the estimates of the ad hoc program when we apply a (one-sided) donut RDD <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">7]</ref> and exclude observations to the left of the threshold (i.e., before December 31). For example, a donut size of 30 days in the figure means that we estimate the effect using a regression discontinuity design that compares refugees who arrived on December 1, 2015 with refugees who arrived on January 1, 2016, excluding all observations between December 2 and December 31. We see that the estimated effect is close to zero and far from statistical significance for all donut sizes. This indicates that the null-finding is not an artifact of choosing a specific donut period.</p><p>â¢ Main Effects for the RDD Excluding Refugees who Also Participated in the Preexisting Program: Figure S.9 displays the effects of the ad hoc program when excluding individuals who, at some point during our study period, enrolled in the preexisting program. Once again, we find no discernible differences. This suggests that our null finding is not influenced by refugees who were ineligible for the ad hoc program but later participated in the pre-existing program. It is important to note that this test conditions on a post-treatment variable and should therefore be interpreted with caution. As an additional verification, we replicated the models to estimate the effect of eligibility for the ad hoc program on the probability of enrolling in the preexisting program. As shown in Figure <ref type="figure">S</ref>.10, we observe a small decline in the participation probability for the preexisting program at the cutoff for the ad hoc program but the estimates are statistically different from zero in only 6 out of 17 months.</p><p>â¢ Main Effects for the RDD by Gender: Figure S.11 shows the effects of the ad hoc program separately for men and women. We observe that the estimates for women are concentrated around zero, while there is more variability for men. As for the pooled estimates, we tend, if anything, to observe negative employment effects for men for selected months after arrival.</p><p>â¢ Main Effects for the RDD by Refugees' State of Residence at Arrival: Figure S.12 shows the effects of the ad hoc program broken down by refugees' state of residence at arrival. For this estimation, we pool the sample across residency months and adjust for residency month fixed effects. We find that there is some heterogeneity, but the distribution of effects is centered around zero. This indicates that the null effects are not driven by particular geographic areas or the results of large treatment effect heterogeneity that averages out to zero.</p><p>â¢ Main Effects for the RDD by Refugees' Education: Figure S.13 shows the effects of the ad hoc program broken down by refugees' education levels and for the pooled sample. Again, we find that there is some heterogeneity, but the distribution of effects is centered around zero. However, it is worth noting that information on education is only implicitly recorded as part of the CV, particularly for job seekers and participants in active labor market programs from the administrative system career path.</p><p>The data quality of the education field can therefore be classified as poor. Therefore, this test should be interpreted cautiously. Covariate Coef. S.E. p(&gt;|z|) Obs.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Supplementary Materials for</head><p>â¢ Tests for Pre-treatment Differences: Table <ref type="table">S</ref>.6 reports formal F-tests for three selected pretreatment periods (3 to 1 month before enrollment, 9 to 1 month before enrollment, and 29 to 1 month before enrollment) and all three employment outcomes based on the twodimensional IFEct estimator. We observe one statistically significant difference in the pretreatment estimates across the three employment outcomes but the substantive magnitude of this difference is small, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref> of the main text. Overall, this indicates support for the identification assumption.</p><p>â¢ Estimates from the CS DR estimator when varying the control group: Figure S.14 presents the estimates from the CS DR estimator using the not-yet-treated and the never-treated units as controls. Although the numerical estimates differ slightly, the pattern remains identical across all three employment outcomes. This consistency indicates that the results are robust across both control groups.</p><p>â¢ Main Effect Estimates Imputing for Attrition: Figure S.15 shows the estimates when imputing a zero for all years post-arrival without an observed employment outcome. The results are very similar, indicating that findings are not an artifact of panel attrition.</p><p>â¢ Main Effect Estimates by Gender: Figure S.16 shows the estimates for samples of men and women separately. Although the estimates for women are somewhat elevated in magnitude (and come with larger confidence intervals due to the reduced estimation sample size), the pattern is similar to that observed for men across all three employment outcomes.</p><p>â¢ Correlates of Enrollment: Table <ref type="table">S</ref>.7 describes the correlates of preexisting program enrollment. Although we find no pronounced differences across age groups, Syrians tend to be more likely to participate in the preexisting program compared to Iraqis, Iranians, and Eritreans. Those reported to have at least some schooling and those without any schooling information are somewhat less likely to participate than those with no reported schooling. Women are less likely to participate compared to men. There are also differences across states: in the city states of Berlin, Hamburg, and Bremen, the propensity for enrollment is lower compared to Saarland and Hesse. </p></div>			</div>
