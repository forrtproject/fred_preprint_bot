<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Most conservation policies and management primarily focus on vertebrate animals. However, considering the high demand for invertebrate species in the exotic pet markets, it is crucial to give them great consideration. This research explores Coenobita purpureus, a land hermit crab newly recorded in Taiwan in 2017. We noticed that it has gained popularity in the online pet market recently, despite limited studies confirming its population. To mitigate the potential risks associated with this species, our study investigated online wildlife trade markets, conducted field surveys for its distribution, and scrutinized relevant regulations in Taiwan. The median price of the species significantly increased after its description. This suggests a growing demand in the exotic pet market, potentially leading to unsustainable trade. Besides, the online platform and coloration of individuals also influenced the price. Furthermore, we discovered that C. purpureus is more widely distributed in Taiwan than initially described in the literature, confirming its native status, though the population may be small. We also identified limitations in current Taiwanese regulations and policies regarding the risk of unsustainable trade in potentially threatened invertebrate species. Moreover, we found evidence of individuals being smuggled from China through e-commerce channels. Regulatory measures addressing the smuggling of small amounts of wildlife are also insufficient, potentially posing invasion risks from alien species. Finally, we drew upon the conclusions from these aspects to provide integrated and practical management implications for policymakers. Additionally, we aim to offer this valuable case study to spotlight the state of the global invertebrate trade.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Land hermit crabs belong to the family Coenobitidae, which comprises about 20 species distributed in tropical coastal areas <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Burggren &amp; McMahon, 1988)</ref>. Their larval stages occur in the ocean, and they migrate from the ocean to land only at the megalopa stage, becoming what are socalled "marine creatures on land." Land hermit crabs, as a type of land crab, play crucial roles in nutrient cycling, serving as a food source for predators, and seed dispersal for coastal forest ecosystems <ref type="bibr">(Alexander et al., 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Burggren &amp; McMahon, 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Huang &amp; Hsu, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Lindquist et al., 2009)</ref>. Coastal forests are part of the green infrastructure that helps protect humans against natural hazards, such as storm surges and tsunamis <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Hoque et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Tanaka et al., 2007)</ref>. Addressing these issues is crucial for conserving these unique creatures and their ecosystem services. Due to habitat loss and overconsumption, their populations are declining. Regarding overconsumption, only coconut crabs (Birgus latro) are considered a food source for humans; other species are kept as exotic pets worldwide <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Hsu, 2021)</ref>. Thus, in the IUCN Red List, only coconut crabs are listed as "Vulnerable" <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Cumberlidge, 2020)</ref>, while other Coenobita species are not evaluated. Understanding their populations, regulations, and market conditions is imperative for conservation management.</p><p>Illegal or unsustainable wildlife trades significantly impact wildlife populations <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Cardoso et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Hinsley et al., 2023)</ref>. However, the evaluation and regulation for invertebrate species are relatively less compared to vertebrates <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Caldas et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Cardoso et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Caro, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Eisenhauer et al., 2019)</ref>. Land hermit crabs (Coenobita sp.) are popular pets worldwide <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bundhitwongrut, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Marnell, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Sasaki, 2014)</ref>. Some reports have highlighted the unsustainable trade of land hermit crabs, e.g., PETA investigation (https://reurl.cc/nDg8g2), Thailand <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bundhitwongrut, 2018)</ref>, and Taiwan <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Hsu &amp; Choi, 2016)</ref>. Furthermore, a recent wildlife smuggling event involving the attempted illegal trafficking of 682 individuals was uncovered in Okinawa, Japan <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Hsu, Wang, et al., 2023</ref>; Okinawa Times: https://reurl.cc/y7V9oq). Considering that consumers' demand for rare and exotic pets is a major driving force behind the wildlife trade <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bush et al., 2014)</ref>, adopting a multiple-dimensional approach in wildlife conservation research for invertebrates is crucial.</p><p>Unlike certain insect pets, the captive breeding of land hermit crabs for commercial marketing remains challenging, primarily due to the high mortality rate during the larvae stage <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Brodie &amp; Harvey, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Liu et al., 2021)</ref>. Consequently, most land hermit crabs available in the market are sourced through wild capture. This unregulated collection of significant numbers of wild crabs for the pet trade has raised serious concerns. Such practices could lead to the unsustainability of land hermit crab populations <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bundhitwongrut, 2018)</ref>.</p><p>This study was initiated based on the observation of peculiar phenomena within the community of land hermit crab enthusiasts on Facebook. In Taiwan, selling land hermit crabs as pets has a long history. In the past, people could easily buy land hermit crabs in markets near coastal areas or even at night markets. However, we believe that due to rising conservation awareness, sellers now tend to sell crabs more discreetly, often using the internet. Most of the species sold are common in Taiwan, such as C. brevimanus, C. cavipes, C. rugosus, and C. violascens. Recently, we have noticed a significant increase in popularity of the land hermit crab species C. purpureus, which is rare in Taiwan, among enthusiasts on Facebook and in the Taiwanese pet market. After the publication of this new record, we observed lively discussions among people regarding the finding. There was a growing number of individuals trying to locate this species around Taiwan, and more people showcasing their pets of this species.</p><p>The combination of the high market price and the potential for a low population in the wild in Taiwan <ref type="bibr">(Chia-Hsuan Hsu, personal observation)</ref> gives rise to a significant concern known as the Anthropogenic Allee Effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Courchamp et al., 2006)</ref>. This effect suggests a positive feedback loop between rarity and price across diverse taxa and geographic regions <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Holden &amp; McDonald-Madden, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Siriwat et al., 2019)</ref>. This interplay ultimately leads to the value rising of a species with its rarity, consequently generating motives for increased exploitation. The impact could worsen by the rise of the Internet, which significantly facilitates the exotic pet trade through extensive advertising and transportation of traded species <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Fink et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Stringham et al., 2021)</ref>. The market conditions of C. purpureus and identify any advertising effects that may have emerged since the publication of new records <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Hsu &amp; Soong, 2017</ref><ref type="bibr">) (i.e., post-2017)</ref>. We also aimed to evaluate any observed price increases for this species.</p><p>Additionally, we explored whether other factors, such as the trading platform or the characteristics of individual crabs, influenced the price of C. purpureus.</p><p>Although C. purpureus is becoming popular in Taiwan's pet market, little is known about their current population distribution in Taiwan. Such uncertainty will cause great challenges for their subsequent conservation and management. Coenobita purpureus was previously considered an endemic species in Japan <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Sanda et al., 2019)</ref>. However, <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Hsu &amp; Soong (2017)</ref> published the first scientific record of C. purpureus, which described a male individual with a light-blue coloration, from Dongji Island in Taiwan. In 2019, an ovigerous female and two male individuals were discovered on Dongsha Island, Taiwan <ref type="bibr">(Hsu et al., 2019)</ref>. These findings are important because they suggest that C. purpureus does inhabit the surrounding islands of Taiwan and they can breed there. However, there are no other further records regarding the distribution of this hermit crab species in mainland Taiwan. Therefore, our second research objective is to confirm the distribution of this species in Taiwan, as a basis for future conservation and management.</p><p>Regulations concerning invertebrates have received limited attention worldwide <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Cardoso et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Caro, 2022)</ref>. Legal regulation is a crucial aspect of conservation <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Oldfield, 2003)</ref>. Legislation aimed at controlling the exploitation and trade of land hermit crabs from natural habitats is currently limited to only a few countries (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). Therefore, the third objective of this study was to conduct an inventory of the relevant laws and regulations about all land hermit crabs and other invertebrates in Taiwan. This is particularly important due to their increasing popularity as pets worldwide <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bundhitwongrut, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Sasaki, 2014)</ref>, despite the current inability to commercially breed them. In the absence of pertinent regulations for conserving land hermit crabs or other invertebrates, a significant gap in conservation management could emerge. Besides, due to the popularity of C. purpureus in the pet market and its high price, there may be smuggling of this species from other countries into Taiwan. Thus, we also documented cases of animal smuggling and presented relevant regulations in Taiwan.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Hsu, 2018)</ref> Wildlife trade research should be cross-disciplinary, combining various variables to provide management recommendations for policymakers <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Blair et al., 2017)</ref>. Our research objectives encompass the following disciplines: (1) Market: Investigating market conditions, such as price disparities before and after the publication of the new record (advertising effect), across different platforms, and among individuals with varying coloration scales; (2) Ecology: Gaining an understanding of the distribution of C. purpureus and ascertaining their settlement in Taiwan;</p><p>(3) Regulation: Making an inventory of the relevant laws and regulations applicable to our case. Ultimately, the paramount goal is to offer management implications that can help policymakers in advancing effective conservation strategies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">METHOD</head><p>The methodology for the study consisted of three main aspects: using the online platforms to understand trading conditions (market aspect), conducting field surveys to investigate the population distribution (ecology aspect) and compiling an inventory of the relevant laws and regulations applicable to our case. The details of each methodology are as follows.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Market aspect: Prices and numbers of C. purpureus in online platform</head><p>To explore the trade conditions of C. purpureus, we followed the guidelines for internet monitoring and quantification of wildlife trade provided by <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Stringham et al., 2021)</ref>. We manually examined the prices and counted the number of individuals of the species listed on popular ecommerce platforms such as Yahoo, Shopee, and Ruten in Taiwan, as well as on the social media platform such as Facebook. We used keywords such as "日日日日日日日", "日日日日日", and "C. purpureus". The manual data collection took place from June 1st to July 30th, 2023. However, we observed that some sellers were offering the species for sale on Facebook without specifying the price. To gather pricing information in such cases, we utilized anonymous accounts to inquire about the prices. Furthermore, due to the rarity and uniqueness of C. purpureus in the past, some of the sale posts with photos and prices were captured and stored as screenshots by one of the authors (Choi). Finally, we recorded the number of individuals, prices, and colors from both sold and unsold crab individuals. We acknowledge that collecting data in this manner may introduce certain biases because some sellers might delete their sales posts after the land hermit crabs are sold, which may lead to underestimations of the sales count.</p><p>To analyze all the factors influencing the price of C. purpureus, we employed a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) with a Gaussian family distribution, appropriate for continuous dependent variables. The dependent variable in our model was "Price," while the independent variables included "Body size," "Color," "Pub," and "Year." The model fitting was conducted using standard statistical software, ensuring that the assumptions of the GLM were checked and validated. The results from the GLM provided insights into how each independent variable affects the price, allowing us to interpret the significance and magnitude of these effects.</p><p>The GLM was formulated as follows:</p><p>Where:</p><p> is the dependent variable representing the price of the crabs.</p><p> is a continuous variable measuring the size of the crabs.</p><p> is a categorical variable with levels indicating the color of the crabs (e.g., dark, light).</p><p> is a categorical variable representing different selling platforms.</p><p> is a continuous variable indicating the year of the sale.</p><p> β0, β1, β2, β3, β4 are the coefficients estimated by the model.  ϵ is the error term.</p><p>To assess the impact of the publication of the new record of C. purpureus on January 1st, 2017, on market pricing, we conducted a statistical test comparing prices before and after that specific point in time. Before performing the statistical test, we checked the normality of the data using the Shapiro-Wilk test. If the data were normally distributed, we proceeded with the t-test. However, if the data did not follow a normal distribution, we used non-parametric tests instead. We also compared the different platforms (Facebook and Shopee) to understand whether the prices differ across various online platforms. Additionally, the sellers provided photos of each individual, allowing us to identify the colors. Two researchers then examined the photos and recorded the colors to ensure consistency. If discrepancies arose between researchers' identifications, they discussed them together to ensure consistency, a process that can be considered a form of triangulation. Subsequently, we compared the price between different coloration scales of individuals (Light color and dark color).</p><p>Fisher's exact test was employed to assess whether the sale of C.</p><p>purpureus individuals before and after 2017 was related to the publication of the new record of the species on January 1st, 2017, and the platforms (i.e., Shopee and Facebook). Additionally, we also utilized Fisher's exact test to investigate the potential association between publication time (i.e., the publication of the new record of the species) and the coloration scale (dark and light colors) of the crab individuals. Furthermore, we utilized Fisher's exact test to explore whether distinct platforms exhibited variations in the coloration scale of the individuals for sale.</p><p>In this section, all the statistical tests were conducted using R 4.2.1(R Core Team, 2022) for analysis. Additionally, R was also utilized for the visualization of the results, providing a comprehensive and coherent representation of the findings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Ecology aspect: Distribution survey of C. purpureus in Taiwan</head><p>To determine the extent of C. purpureus distribution in Taiwan, we conducted an unsystematic survey to investigate settled populations of C.</p><p>purpureus between 2018 and 2023. Due to the unsystematic nature of the surveys, the selection of survey locations and times was non-randomized.</p><p>Consequently, the survey efforts, timing, and locations may lack standardization, making it challenging to directly compare abundance and density across different sites. When encountering the target species, we temporarily placed them in a box due to the small number of individuals.</p><p>After counting and double-checking the species, we released them and recorded the numbers. Species identification was done by referencing previous literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Yukio, 1988)</ref>, and the distinct characteristics of C.</p><p>purpureus made them easy to recognize. Any uncertainty was addressed by taking photos and confirming with other team members. We identified C. purpureus on beaches through visual examination.</p><p>Considering the potential risk of poaching, we chose not to disclose the exact locations in this paper, as recommended by <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Lindenmayer &amp; Scheele (2017)</ref>. Instead, we present descriptive statistics and maps at the city, county, or island level to illustrate the number of individuals observed at each location.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Law and Regulation Aspect: Regulations and Cases about C. purpureus in Taiwan</head><p>To understand the regulations related to this case, we provided some relevant regulations and previous cases associated with our target species for this study. As our target species is not a protected species in Taiwan, noteworthy that the price exhibited a significant increase compared to the price prior to the publication of the new record, with the median price being five times higher than that before 2017 (p &lt; 0.001, Mann-Whitney test) (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>; Table <ref type="table">3</ref>). In terms of the platform effect, because no crab individuals were sold on Shopee before the new record was published in 2017, we only compared the prices on different platforms after 2017. The prices of C. purpureus showed significant differences (p = 0.012, Mann-Whitney test), with the median price being 33% higher on Facebook than on Shopee (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>; Table <ref type="table">3</ref>). Furthermore, when comparing the prices of C. purpureus with different colorations, the prices of dark-colored individuals were significantly higher than those of their light-colored counterparts, with the median price of dark-colored individuals being 1.5 and 3.7 times higher than that of light-colored ones before 2017 and after 2017, respectively (p &lt; 0.001, Mann-Whitney test) (Figure . 3; Table <ref type="table">3</ref>).    <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>). Furthermore, a significant dependence was noted between the publication time and the color scale of the specimens, indicating that the proportion of dark-colored individuals being sold increased after 2017 ( p &lt; 0.001, Fisher's exact test, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>). However, no statistically significant dependence was observed between the selling platforms and the color scale (p = 1, Fisher's exact test,  <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">5</ref>). Following the discovery sequence, subsequent locations included Lanyu, New Taipei City, Keelung, Yilan County, Green Island, and Kaohsiung City. We have also integrated the prior discovery sites identified by our team, namely Dongji Island <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Hsu &amp; Soong, 2017)</ref> and Dongsha Island <ref type="bibr">(Hsu et al., 2019)</ref> (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>; Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>).</p><p>Due to variations in survey efforts at each location, determining the exact population size is not feasible; however, we have provided this information as a reference in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>.  USD) to NT$300,000 (10,000 USD). Additionally, according to the Directions for Fines for Cases of Violation of the National Park Law, for those who hunt animals or catch fish, the fine for the first offense is NT$3000 (100 USD), and for subsequent offenses, the fine remains at NT$3000. Some real cases of people being fined under the National Park Law for catching land hermit crabs. For instance, in 2020, a man was fined NT$3000 for catching 30 individuals of land hermit crabs (News: https://reurl.cc/mDQeoG).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.4">Smuggling from other countries</head><p>In conclusion, our study has identified two laws that may be relevant to our research. The first is the Smuggling Penalty Act, which deals with criminal penalties for smuggling activities. The second is the Wildlife Conservation Act, which imposes administrative sanctions for violations related to wildlife conservation. In the next section, we will delve into a detailed discussion of these two laws and their implications for the management of land hermit crabs in Taiwan.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">DISCUSSION</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Wildlife trade of C. purpureus</head><p>We confirmed a significant rise in the price of C. purpureus for sale on platforms, notably following the year 2017, which coincides with the publication of the new record in Taiwan during that same year. This suggests that the publication of this new record may have triggered an "advertising effect", potentially leading to increased public notice and interest. Such an effect can be further supported by other aspects that we found the publication in 2017 did ignite discussions within various hermit crab enthusiast communities in Taiwan (personal observation). We attempted to conduct text or content analysis using communities' discussion posts. However, we encountered challenges as some of the communities changed or closed, resulting in the disappearance of discussion posts. Consequently, we could only rely on "Personal observation" to describe this phenomenon. The advertising effect has not only occurred in C. purpureus but has been documented in other taxa, e.g., spiders <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Henriques, 2020)</ref> and amphibians <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Gluszek et al., 2021)</ref>, that they become targets for poaching in the pet market after their publication as new species. The substantial rising prices strongly suggest a continued upward trend in species demand. Policymakers should direct their attention toward the decline in local populations and occurrences of smuggling.</p><p>We found a significant dependence between the selling platform and publication time (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>), with the proportion of C. purpureus individuals for sale on Shopee increasing after 2017, whereas no such increase was observed on Facebook. This discrepancy could potentially be attributed to the fact that the Shopee company was established in 2015 and gained more popularity by 2017. Consequently, sellers predominantly utilized Shopee as a selling platform only after 2017. In contrast, with Facebook, sellers used it as a selling platform irrespective of whether it was before or after 2017. In the realm of e-commerce wildlife trade, Taiwan's renowned shopping website, Shopee, has made a declaration that prohibits sellers from vending live animals on their platform. However, sellers have adopted the strategy of labeling their offerings as "models" or "toys" to evade detection by the website's policies and still sell live species. We recommend that the company and policymakers devise strategies to counteract sellers who exploit these loopholes.</p><p>Regarding the price of body coloration, we discovered that the price of dark-colored individuals was significantly higher than that of light-colored individuals. This discrepancy is logically understandable, as dark-colored individuals tend to be more vivid and attractive, thus commanding a higher selling price. However, it's important to take into account that darkcolored individuals also tend to exhibit larger body sizes [personal observation for C. purpureus and evidence for marine hermit crab Clibanarius virescens <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Yoshikawa et al., 2020)</ref>], and consequently, their higher pricing can also be attributed to their larger size. In Table <ref type="table">3</ref>, we found a significant dependence between publication time and coloration, highlighting a prevalence of dark-colored individuals post-2017. This finding suggests that following the publication of the new record, there was a preference for darker and larger individuals. Consequently, policymakers should pay more attention to larger-sized individuals, as they tend to exhibit greater fecundity potential, similar to other crustaceans <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Hamasaki et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Mantelatto et al., 2002)</ref>. Moreover, land hermit crabs are long-lived and slow-maturing animals. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Liu et al. (2021)</ref> revealed that C. rugosus takes 8 years to reach maturity in captivity. If larger and older individuals are caught, this could potentially have a severe impact on the population, similar to the situation with coconut crabs. While we acknowledge that the time factor might influence the price analysis when considering the coloration of individuals, it does not affect the outcome that darker and larger individuals tend to command higher prices in this study.</p><p>In terms of statistical methods in this study, we acknowledge that Fisher's exact test does not account for the temporal sequence of events.</p><p>Establishing causality often requires demonstrating that changes in one variable precede changes in another, a consideration not addressed by Fisher's exact test. Furthermore, this test does not ascertain the direction of the relationship between variables; it merely indicates whether an association exists. Without knowledge of the direction of the relationship, inferring causality becomes challenging.</p><p>In addition, we found an intriguing phenomenon on these e-commerce platforms involves the sale of species not native to Taiwan, such as C.</p><p>clypeatus and C. lila, which raises smuggling concerns related to C.</p><p>purpureus on these platforms. We searched the database of the Taiwanese Bureau of Foreign Trade and found no records of legally imported land hermit crabs. Therefore, species sold online in Taiwan but not naturally distributed here must be the result of smuggling. Our target species, C.</p><p>purpureus, also carries a significant potential for smuggling, either directly or indirectly from Japan (Environmental Information Center News:</p><p>https://e-info.org.tw/node/77197), given the limited populations found in Taiwan. We noted numerous sellers offering C. purpureus on Taobao, the largest online shopping platform in China. The current event involved a couple who were land hermit crab sellers on Taobao in China, and they intended to smuggle 682 individuals of C. purpureus from Okinawa, Japan <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Hsu, Wang, et al., 2023</ref>; Okinawa Times: https://reurl.cc/y7V9oq). We gathered information from sellers on Taobao who admitted to smuggling live land hermit crabs into Taiwan from Hong Kong and mainland China through messages on online platforms. Furthermore, the smuggling event may not just occur directly from Okinawa to China; a local person told us that she had been asked to catch the C. purpureus from Okinawa and send them to mainland Japan by Chinese people. Thus, we provided the potential smuggling path of C. purpureus can be found in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5</ref>. We suggest that managers take the issue of illegal wildlife trade seriously, since land hermit crabs are relatively small and cold-blooded, which increases the difficulty of detecting smuggling <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Fukushima et al., 2021)</ref>. While land hermit crabs are not classified as an invasive species in Taiwan, we recommend that policymakers focus on regulating animal smuggling, particularly for invertebrates. This is crucial to prevent other potentially invasive species from negatively impacting local ecosystems, such as the case of crayfish <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Chucholl, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Faulkes, 2010)</ref> and the spider <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Shivambu et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Furthermore, not only C. purpureus but also other species of land hermit crab, C. perlatus and C. pseudorugosus, have been newly recorded in Taiwan <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Chen et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Hsu et al., 2022)</ref>. Especially, the population of C. perlatus is much smaller than that of C. purpureus, it is also popular on online shopping platforms (Personal observation). Hence, a similar situation might potentially occur with C. perlatus, warranting further attention and concern.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Distribution of C. purpureus in Taiwan</head><p>We conducted unsystematic surveys focusing on C. purpureus, spanning the years 2018 to 2023, across the main island and neighboring islands of Taiwan. To our surprise, the presence of C. purpureus encompasses New Taipei, Yilan, and Kaohsiung, along with adjacent islands like Lanyu, Green</p><p>Island, and Dongsha Island. As a result, we can definitively affirm the natural distribution of C. purpureus in Taiwan.</p><p>Although C. purpureus can be found in Taiwan, information regarding its population size remains limited. It appears that the population is higher in Northern Taiwan; however, this observation might be biased because the surveyors reside in Northern Taiwan. It is not possible to directly compare the population sizes among survey locations due to variations in survey efforts. Nevertheless, it seems that the population of C. purpureus is relatively limited when compared to the sympatric land hermit crab species, C. rugosus (personal observation). From 2018 to 2023, there are some systematic survey studies about land hermit crabs in Taiwan, including Kenting <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Hsu et al., 2018)</ref>, Wang-An Island <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Hsu, Fang, Jiang, et al., 2023)</ref>, Dongsha Island <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Hsu, Liang, et al., 2019)</ref>, and Yilan Dakenggu Community <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Hsu, Fang, Chiu, et al., 2023)</ref>. Nevertheless, only three individuals of C. purpureus were found on Donsha Island <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Hsu, Liang, et al., 2019)</ref>. This indicates that the population size of C. purpureus is quite low in Taiwan.</p><p>As C. purpureus has gained significant popularity among the Taiwanese hermit crab enthusiast community, conducting further ecological research to comprehensively understand the population dynamics and distribution patterns of C. purpureus. This is imperative for accurately assessing the conservation status of this species. Notably, the commercial captive breeding of land hermit crabs remains an unachieved feat at present <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Liu et al., 2021)</ref>. Given this circumstance, any involvement of this species in the wildlife trade could potentially result in overexploitation, further exacerbating the risk of regional extinction. Besides, Thus, the relevant regulation and management strategy should be imperative.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Laws and regulations related to our case</head><p>In terms of improper methods to catch land hermit crabs, it is known that most of the land hermit crab poaching is done using food bait or direct capture, and not by using methods prohibited by the law, such as  unsustainable wildlife trades <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Hsu, 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Van Song, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Wellsmith, 2011)</ref>, which is believed to be a significant reason for the frequent occurrence of such trades. However, we don't know if higher penalties can increase the deterrent effect. At least, a higher fine can be used as funding for wildlife conservation and restoration.</p><p>In terms of smuggling, we believe that constituting a criminal penalty under the Smuggling Penalty Act for smuggling land hermit crabs is extremely difficult, almost impossible, due to the requirement of a large quantity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">MANAGEMENT IMPLICATION</head><p>According to our study, we offer some suggestions for policymakers.</p><p>First, ecological information is crucial. We need to conduct further research to understand habitat preferences, hotspots, population sizes, and more. The significance of scientific knowledge is evident in Aichi Target 19, which emphasizes enhancing "scientific knowledge about biodiversity and its applicability in decision-making" as a fundamental factor for shaping the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity's development <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Marques et al., 2014)</ref>. With this information, we can determine the conservation status of C. purpureus or establish wildlife refuges as needed.</p><p>Based on our preliminary findings, we believe that the population of C.</p><p>purpureus is low in Taiwan. Conducting an ecological study requires a certain amount of time; however, the capturing and wildlife trading of this species is still ongoing. Thus, we suggest considering referencing the Japanese policy applied to certain species, which involves one giant centipede (Scolopendra alcyona), two cockroaches (Eucorydia donanensis and Eucorydia miyakoensis), and one damselfly (Platycnemis phyllopoda).</p><p>This policy involves the implementation of a temporary ban on capturing, importing, exporting, transferring, and displaying or advertising the species after its discovery, to ensure its conservation status (From Ministry of Environment, Japan:</p><p>https://www.env.go.jp/nature/kisho/kinkyushiteishu.html). Besides, there is another Japanese policy known as the "Specified Type 2 Domestic Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora," which allows individuals to use the species for research, environmental education, breeding, and other non-commercial purposes, while imposing restrictions on their transfer, display, or advertisement. This policy involves 13 salamander species belonging to the Family Hynobiidae, one freshwater fish (Hemigrammocypris neglectus), and one insect (Kirkaldyia deyrolli) (From Ministry of Environment, Japan: https://www.env.go.jp/page_00707.html).</p><p>We believe that this regulation is reasonable and recommend its reference, as introducing a species to the market could lead to a higher demand than personal small-scale catching.</p><p>Regarding the risk of potential smuggling, we propose that policymakers establish regulations for wildlife smuggling, even in the case of small quantities. This precaution is crucial due to the possible introduction of invasive species into Taiwan. Furthermore, we suggest the revision of wildlife conservation regulations to suit current requirements better, particularly emphasizing the importance of invertebrates and ensuring that these regulations carry a robust deterrent effect.</p><p>Additionally, a focus on enhancing technological advancements in detection and enforcement is necessary to effectively combat illegal wildlife smuggling.</p><p>Preserving intact habitats for land hermit crabs is of utmost importance.</p><p>These crab species inhabit coastal forests and migrate to the seashore during the breeding season. However, numerous coastal forests are under threat due to tourism development, solar panel installations, road construction, and unnecessary building projects. An encouraging example comes from the Dakenggu community in Yilan County, where residentsinitiated surveys and restoration efforts for the coastal forest. They aim to bolster the population of land crabs for environmental education and ecotourism purposes <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Hsu, Fang, Chiu, et al., 2023)</ref>. Collaboration with residents and developing a citizen science project for long-term monitoring and guarding against poaching are essential for effective conservation <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Hsu, Chang, et al., 2019)</ref>.</p><p>Education plays a crucial role in raising public conservation awareness.</p><p>We firmly believe that the ecology of land hermit crabs offers valuable material for environmental education. Their life cycle spans both the ocean and land, providing insights into marine and coastal forest ecosystems.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>FIGURE 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>FIGURE 1.

How do we know it's from China and not Japan? We asked several online sellers in China if they had experience shipping C. purpureus to Taiwan. Some of them responded affirmatively, stating a success rate of 50%. That's why we have to include the relevant laws related to smuggling in our study. Article 2, paragraph 1 of the Smuggling Penalty Act states: "Offenders of illegally import or export controlled articles are subject to a fixed-term imprisonment of 7 years maximum, and may be fined no more than three million New Taiwan Dollars (approximately 100,000 USD)." Constituent elements: a. The customs taxable value must exceed one hundred thousand New Taiwan Dollars or the weight must exceed one thousand kilograms. b. The goods are smuggled from Mainland China in a single shipment.c. The items, rice, rice flour, peanuts, tea leaves, or seeds (bulbs) have not been allowed for import by the competent authority.In these criminal penalties of smuggling cases, the verdicts are as follows: Clams (Mercenaria mercenarius) (total weight 9,808.9 kilograms, 836 bags) resulted in a 5-month imprisonment. 154 various breeds of cats led to a sentence of 6 months of imprisonment with probation. As for the smuggling of 8,086 kilograms of clams (M. mercenaria), the sentence was 7 months of imprisonment. Another related to smuggling belongs to administrative sanction is Article 51, Subparagraph 3 of the Wildlife Conservation Act states: Violation of Article 24, Paragraph 1 by import or export of General Wildlife without the approval of the National Principal Authority (NPA), shall be subjected to a fine of not less than NT$10,000 and not more than NT$50,000 (approximately 333 to 1667 USD).
