<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, some American states had transitioned to universal voting-by-mail, where all registered voters receive a mail ballot. But due to the pandemic, universal voting-by-mail was suddenly used in a larger number of states in 2020. Here we study a unique situation in which registered voters in some legislative districts in Los Angeles County were subjected to universal voting-by-mail in the March 2020 primary. Using difference-in-differences and geographic boundary-based designs on individual-level records, we take advantage of this within-jurisdiction situation to estimate the causal effects of universal voting-by-mail on voter turnout and on who votes. Our results indicate that voter turnout increased by 3 to 4 percentage points for voters who do not automatically receive a mail ballot, and the increase is generally larger for registered partisan voters than those without a party affiliation.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Research on voting by mail in the United States has generally concentrated on two important questions. First, does offering eligible voters the opportunity to obtain and return their ballot by mail increase the likelihood that they will cast a ballot? Second, does offering a voting-by-mail option alter the demographic or political composition of the electorate? We consider both of these questions in this paper, taking advantage of a novel situation that arose in the 2020 March statewide primary in Southern California.</p><p>Voting by mail in American elections is generally implemented in one of two ways. The first is what we call absentee voting -which is an opt-in process, whereby a registered voter needs to request that they receive a ballot in the mail, and in some jurisdictions the requesting voter needs to meet some conditions to be eligible to receive the mail ballot. The second approach is what we call universal voting by mail (UVBM), where all registered voters in a jurisdiction automatically receive a ballot in the mail. We focus on UVMB in this paper, and discuss the UVMB process specifically in the next section. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref>Regarding whether voting by mail in general stimulates turnout, past academic research has produced mixed results. On the one hand, a number of studies have indicated that voting by mail (whether absentee voting or UVBM) might increase voter turnout modestly; for example, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Southwell and Burchett (2000)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Richey (2008)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">or Gerber, Huber and Hill (2013)</ref>. On the other hand, competing studies have argued that voting by mail does not boost turnout <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Gronke and Miller, 2012)</ref>, and may even depress turnout <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Kousser and Mullin, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bergman and Yates, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Keele and Titiunik, 2018)</ref>. For an excellent review of this literature, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Gronke et al. (2008)</ref>.</p><p>Perhaps not surprisingly, as studies have produced mixed results about whether voting by mail boosts turnout (and when it appears to boost turnout, the effects are slight or modest), most academic research on voting by mail has also concluded that it does not change the composition of the electorate. This has particularly been the case for partisan and politically consequential changes in the composition of the electorate. Early research found that making registration and voting more convenient did not have strong partisan consequences <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Wolfinger and Rosenstone, 1980)</ref>, with early studies of absentee voting arguing that it only seems to boost partisan vote shares in places where a particular political party is already strong <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Patterson and Caldeira, 1985)</ref>. This has generally been confirmed in more recent research <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Gerber, Huber and Hill, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Thompson et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Barber and Holbein, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Bonica et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>A critical problem with past studies on the behavioral implications of voting by mail is that most (though not all) of the studies have been observational. Typically the observational studies have used ecological or survey data, not individual micro-level data, and have not used methods that are appropriate for causal inference. Exceptions are a number of more recent studies, which typically take advantage of staggering adoption of universal voting by mail across counties where transitions to voting by mail have occurred gradually within or across a number of western states (Washington, Utah, and California in particular) <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Gerber, Huber and Hill, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Thompson et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Barber and Holbein, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Bonica et al., 2021)</ref>. We provide a summary of the research literature on universal voting by mail in the paper's Supplementary Information, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">SI</ref>.1.</p><p>Our study advances research on the turnout and electoral composition effects of universal voting by mail, as we estimate the causal effects within a single jurisdiction. We apply appropriate causal inference techniques (difference-in-differences and geographic boundary-based designs) to individual-level data from Los Angeles County's March 2, 2020 primary election (conducted before the COVID-19 pandemic altered California election administration), where voters in some legislative districts received ballots in the mail while voters in neighboring areas in the county did not. Our focus on this limited geographic area is what differentiates our study from past research, which has examined how universal voting by mail affects individual voters across different election administration jurisdictions, namely different counties or states. 2   First, even within states like Washington, Utah, and California, there is considerable variation across counties in terms of election administration, political competition and culture, and their social and demographic composition. For example, county election officials are often allowed to decide the number of polling places, set precinct boundaries, and enforce voter identification laws <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Brady and McNulty, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Atkeson et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">White, Nathan and Faller, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Merivaki and Suttmann-Lea, 2023)</ref>. These county-bycounty differences produce unobserved confounders, which could bias their estimates of the electoral effects of universal voting by mail.</p><p>Moreover, since counties usually have discretion over when or whether to opt to implement universal voting by mail, the implementation is correlated with observable and unobservable county characteristics and past turnout. For example, five rural counties (of 39 total counties) were the first to implement universal voting by mail in Washington State <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Gerber, Huber and Hill, 2013)</ref>. The counties' self-selection into treatment could lead to endogeneity bias if the selection is in part based on turnout history, or omitted variable bias if the selection is correlated with county characteristics that are unobservable or not subject to control. 3   Another important issue is how universal voting by mail was typically implemented in these states, usually as part of a package of different reforms, including the elimination of neighborhood polling places and the use of an extended period of pre-election voting opportunities. The elimination of polling places that accompanied universal voting by mail as cost-saving measures in several states' election reforms may reduce turnout <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Gerber, Huber and Hill, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Keele and Titiunik, 2018)</ref> and therefore explain the null or 2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Barber and Holbein (2020)</ref> noted the violation of the parallel trends assumption in the cross-county study (page 3). <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Thompson et al. (2020)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Barber and Holbein (2020)</ref> address this violation by making parametric assumptions about the underlying turnout trends (linear or quadratic) absent the policy. By contrast, our research design directly addresses the underlying issues. 3 As <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Keele and Titiunik (2018)</ref> noted, "given that voter administration is conducted by county governments, counties may choose their mode of voting to try to accomplish their specific voter turnout goals. This type of strategic decision-making may complicate naive statistical inferences that simply compare all-mail counties to in-person counties." negative effects on turnout found in previous studies. Those compounding treatments make it difficult for these studies to isolate the treatment effect of universal voting by mail.</p><p>In comparison, our study takes advantage of within-county variation between universal vote-by-mail districts and non-universal vote-by-mail districts. Our within-jurisdiction design mitigates potential confounding factors that exist in earlier cross-county and cross-state studies. Counties in California are the basic unit of election jurisdiction, and in terms of the administration of the 2020 primary election, there was little other than universal voting by mail that varied across the districts in our analysis. By focusing on a single jurisdiction, our analysis avoids confounding factors that are present in previous cross-jurisdictional studies (for example, a transition to vote centers or a substantial reduction of in-person voting opportunities, as studied by <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Stein and Vonnahme (2008)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Brady and McNulty (2011)</ref>). And while Los Angeles County has considerable demographic diversity, we take that into consideration in our analyses discussed below. In particular, recognizing that registered voters are not uniformly distributed throughout Los Angeles County, we account for that heterogeneity by incorporating demographic and socioeconomic characteristics into our difference-in-differences and geographic boundary-based designs. Thus our study has strong internal validity, in particular relative to previous studies employing cross-county or cross-state variation.</p><p>In addition to leveraging within-county variation, our research design has two other advantages. First, we make a crucial distinction between permanent and non-permanent absentee voters and separately estimate the effects of the universal vote-by-mail on these two groups of voters. Since permanent absentee voters automatically receive a mail ballot regardless of the policy, estimating the effects on all registered voters conflates how many voters are affected by the policy and how much they are affected. Secondly, our study is the first to use a geographic boundary-based design within a jurisdiction to estimate the effects of universal vote-by-mail on voter turnout. By focusing on the local average treatment effects, the geographic boundary-based design provides a way to control for unobservable confounders that may remain in the difference-in-differences design. 4   In the next section, we discuss universal voting by mail, and the particular situation pertinent to our research design, in more detail and argue that our design has especially strong internal validity. Then we discuss the data and methods that we employ, and thereafter we present the results of our analysis. We conclude by discussing the implications of our work for the national conversation about universal voting by mail.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Universal Mail Elections</head><p>Conventional wisdom about election administration in the United States (including much of the debate that occurred prior to the 2020 presidential election) seems to assume that allowing eligible citizens to obtain and cast ballots remotely is a new and untested voting procedure. Quite the contrary is the case -for example, since the American Civil War, military personnel have been able to obtain and cast ballots from where they are stationed or deployed, whether by using a remote polling process, the mail, or some electronic method <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Alvarez, Hall and Roberts, 2007)</ref>. Different forms of remote voting have been available in most states in the more contemporary period; by the 1980s, most states allowed excuse-backed absentee voting, with three states allowing no-excuse absentee voting and one state allowing in-person early voting <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Gronke et al., 2008)</ref>.</p><p>The first state to implement the universal mail voting model was Oregon, which piloted universal mail elections in 1995 and 1996, with statewide implementation in 1998.</p><p>The Oregon model has been widely studied, though whether sending every registered 4 Geographic boundary-based designs including regression discontinuity designs have proven to be a useful tool in the study of voter turnout. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Gerber, Kessler and Meredith (2011)</ref> estimated the effect of a partisan campaign activity on voter turnout, while <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Keele, Titiunik and Zubizarreta (2015)</ref> estimated the effect of a ballot initiative on voter turnout, both using regression discontinuity designs. voter a ballot in the mail has boosted turnout in Oregon elections has been debated <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Southwell and Burchett, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Gronke and Miller, 2012)</ref>. The universal mail election model has been more recently adopted by Washington and Colorado <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Gerber, Huber and Hill, 2013)</ref>, and was used in other states during the 2020 general election due to the COVID-19 pandemic <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Kamarck et al., 2020)</ref>. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">5</ref> Recent changes in California's election laws mandate that future elections in the state follow the universal voting by mail model.</p><p>In the pre-pandemic era, California began to experiment with universal mail elections through the Voter's Choice Act (VCA). In the 2018 election cycle, five California counties implemented the VCA (Madera, Napa, Nevada, Sacramento, and San Mateo). Research has found that voter turnout increased by about three percent in the VCA counties in the 2018 primaries and general elections <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(McGhee et al., 2020)</ref>. Ten additional counties implemented the VCA in the 2020 election cycle for their statewide primary and general elections (Amador, Butte, Calaveras, El Dorado, Fresno, Los Angeles, Mariposa, Orange, Santa Clara, and Tuolumne). Unlike other California counties transitioning to the full VCA, Los Angeles County was exempted from the provision that required sending to all registered voters countywide a vote-by-mail ballot for the March 2020 primary election.</p><p>However, to ensure uniformity of voting experience within a congressional or state legislative district, Los Angeles County was required to send mail ballots to voters who live in districts that span Los Angeles and other neighboring VCA counties.</p><p>How does universal voting by mail increase turnout? Here the theory of the calculus of voting provides support for the general argument that the areas of Los Angeles County that received the universal voting by mail treatment should show higher levels of voter turnout <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Riker and Ordeshook, 1968)</ref>. The calculus of voting posits that registering to vote, finding out where to vote, learning about the candidates and issues on the ballot, and taking the time to vote on Election Day, are all costly actions. As the returns from voting are not typically great, the costs of these actions may at the margin lead many eligible citizens to not participate, which has been confirmed by many studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Rosenstone and Wolfinger, 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Leighley and Nagler, 2013)</ref>. Universal voting by email eliminates some of these costs of voting, and may also give registered voters a subtle "nudge" to make sure they participate <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Kim, 2023)</ref>. Thus, based on the theory of the calculus of voting, we expect that voters residing in the areas of Los Angeles County treated by universal voting by mail in the March 2020 primary should be more likely to turn out in the election.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Data and Methods</head><p>Pertinent to this research is Section 4007 of the VCA, which required Los Angeles County to send mail ballots to Los Angeles County voters who live in state legislative or federal congressional districts that span Los Angeles and other neighboring VCA counties. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">6</ref>Since Orange County was the only VCA county adjacent to Los Angeles County in the 2020 election cycle, Los Angeles County voters residing in districts spanning Los Angeles County and Orange County automatically received a mail ballot for the March 2020 presidential primary elections, regardless of their permanent absentee status. We call these districts universal vote-by-mail districts. Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> provides a congressional district map in Los Angeles County with the universal vote-by-mail districts in orange and non-universal vote-by-mail districts in blue. In summary, the UVBM treatments in this election occurred:</p><p>• In three Congressional districts <ref type="bibr">(CA 38,</ref><ref type="bibr">CA 39,</ref><ref type="bibr">and CA 47)</ref>  we demonstrate that our results continue to hold while incorporating these variables in our analyses.</p><p>Our analysis proceeds in three stages. We start by examining the aggregate voter turnout in universal and non-universal vote-by-mail districts from 2012 to 2020. Using precinct-level and individual-level voter turnout, we test the validity of the parallel trends assumption for our difference-in-differences design.</p><p>In the second stage, using a difference-in-differences design on individual records, we estimate the effects of sending mail ballots to all registered voters, on turnout and the composition of the electorate. 7 Specifically in our difference-in-differences analyses we compare voters residing in universal vote-by-mail districts (the treatment group)</p><p>to those living in non-universal vote-by-mail districts (the control group), in terms of their turnout in 2020 (after the policy was implemented) relative to 2016 (before the policy was implemented). Crucially, we conduct the difference-in-difference analysis for non-permanent absentee voters and permanent absentee voters separately. 8 For nonpermanent absentee voters (the main focus of this paper), mail ballots were automatically sent to them only if they resided in universal vote-by-mail districts and only in 2020.</p><p>Therefore the difference in differences in turnout yields an estimate of the desired causal effect. By contrast, since permanent absentee voters received mail ballots automatically regardless of the policy under consideration, the policy should not directly affect them but may have indirect effects. 9 We use a voter's permanent absentee status as of the 2018 7 We also examined whether sending mail ballots to all registered voters affected voter registration numbers by taking advantage of the fact that the overwhelming majority of mail ballots were sent out to registered voters on February 3, a month before the election. We find that 0.86% of registered voters in universal vote-by-mail districts were newly registered between February 3 and the election day, and 0.94% of registered voters in non-universal vote-by-mail districts were newly registered during the same period. These numbers indicate that registered voters receiving their ballots automatically in the mail did not induce other eligible voters to register. 8 We include in the category permanent absentee all registered voters designated as being covered by the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act (UOCAVA voters). UOCAVA voters account for less than 1% of permanent absentee voters. 9 One channel through which permanent absentee voters may be indirectly affected is the spillover effect. For example, it may occur in situations where permanent absentee voters reside in a household with non-permanent absentee voters; one resident receiving a ballot in the mail could affect the other resident's likelihood of turning out to vote. Our research design does not allow us to distinguish the different channels of these indirect effects, but as we show in the results section, the estimated effects on permanent absentee voters are statistically indistinguishable from zero.</p><p>general election--before the policy was implemented--in our analyses. 10   The difference-in-differences design estimates the average treatment effect on the treated. In addition to the average effect, policymakers may also be interested in the treatment effects on different subgroups. To this end, we explore the heterogeneity of treatment effects by demographics and neighborhood socioeconomic characteristics.</p><p>Moreover, we incorporate these covariates in our difference-in-differences design following <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Callaway and Sant'Anna (2021)</ref>. Their approach allows for covariate-specific trends in turnout between universal and non-universal vote-by-mail districts, which is particularly useful in situations where the distribution of covariates varies across groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Callaway and Sant'Anna, 2021)</ref>.</p><p>In the third stage, we estimate the causal effects of sending mail ballots to all registered voters using geographic boundary-based designs on geo-coded individual records. Specifically for our geographic boundary-based designs, we geo-locate all registered voters in Los Angeles County using a combination of the Census API and the Google Maps API, and calculate the distances of their residential addresses to the boundary of universal and non-universal vote-by-mail districts. 11 Using the distances to the boundary, we conduct a geographic boundary-based regression discontinuity analysis using the distance to the boundary as the running variable. The geographic boundary-based regression discontinuity analysis allows us to estimate the local average treatment effect of the policy on voters residing near the boundary of universal and non-universal vote-by-mail districts. By focusing on the causal effects on voters residing close to the boundary, the regression discontinuity analysis provides us a way to control for remaining confounding 10 A voter's permanent absentee status as of the 2018 general election is pre-treatment and hence avoids potential post-treatment bias from using the permanent absentee status as of the 2020 primary election. Moreover, non-permanent absentee voters in non-universal vote-by-mail districts could still sign up for the permanent absentee status before the 2020 primary election to automatically receive their ballots in the mail, providing the desired counterfactual for non-permanent absentee voters in universal vote-by-mail districts absent the policy.</p><p>11 Neither the Census API nor the Google Maps API work for 100% of the addresses due to compatibility issues between addresses in the voter file and addresses in the Census or Google Maps databases. To make sure that we do not systematically miss any subset of voters due to these issues, we manually checked and resolved all street names that appeared ten times or more in the voter file. factors in our difference-in-differences analysis.</p><p>The key identification assumption of a regression discontinuity design is the continuity assumption, which requires the potential outcome to change continuously at the cutoff. We examine this assumption by a series of placebo designs with past election turnout information and look at the distribution of demographic and neighborhood socioeconomic characteristics in the vicinity of the boundary of universal and nonuniversal vote-by-mail districts. Research designs based on geographic boundaries often face unique challenges <ref type="bibr">(Keele and Titiunik, 2015)</ref>, and in our case, such challenges come from the fact that district lines in California were drawn by the California Citizens Redistricting Commission in accordance with federal and state regulations and often follow community boundaries. In light of the challenges, we also conduct additional analyses where we match registered voters in universal and non-universal vote-by-mail districts near the boundary based on their demographics, neighborhood socioeconomic characteristics, as well as school districts, and conduct difference-in-differences analyses on the matched subset of registered voters near the boundary. 12</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Aggregate Results</head><p>Before diving into results from our individual-level analyses, we examine aggregate voter turnout in universal and non-universal vote-by-mail districts. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref> shows the voter turnout among all registered voters in universal vote-by-mail districts (blue) and nonuniversal vote-by-mail districts (orange) in primary elections from 2012 to 2020. 13 We 12 For methodological discussions on using matching in geographic boundary-based designs and other applications, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Keele, Titiunik and Zubizarreta (2015)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Keele et al.

Researchers may also be interested in turnout among eligible voters, a population for which we do not have individual-level or high-quality granular data. The best estimate we can get is the 5-year American Community Survey data on citizen voting-age population (CVAP) from the U.S. Census Bureau. According to our best estimate based on Census data, turnout among the citizen voting-age population increased by half a percentage point in Note: Universal VBM Districts refer to congressional districts and state legislative districts where all registered voters automatically received a ballot in the mail in the 2020 primary elections, shown in orange in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Difference in Differences</head><p>We begin by looking at the effects of sending mail ballots to all registered voters on the percentage of voters voting by mail, separately for permanent absentee voters and non-permanent absentee voters (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>, left panel). For permanent absentee voters, sending mail ballots to all registered voters does not directly impact them because they automatically receive a mail ballot for each election. We find that permanent absentee voters in universal vote-by-mail districts and non-universal vote-by-mail districts cast Note: Universal VBM Districts refer to congressional districts and state legislative districts where all registered voters automatically received a mail ballot in the 2020 primary elections. The lines trace the turnout of the same group of voters in the previous primary election. The y-axes are on different scales. The estimated effect on turnout is 3.2 percentage points (s.e. = 0.88 p.p.) for non-permanent VBM voters and 0.7 percentage points (s.e. = 0.86 p.p.) for permanent VBM voters. Complete results are in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">SI</ref>.5 and Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">SI</ref>.6.</p><p>their vote by mail in substantively similar percentages in both the 2016 and 2020 elections.</p><p>For non-permanent absentee voters, however, the policy has a direct impact on them because they automatically receive a mail ballot only if they reside in a universal voteby-mail district. Those residing in a non-universal vote-by-mail district need to request a mail ballot before the request deadline to vote by mail. While more voters cast their ballots by mail over time, the increase in the percentage of voters voting by mail is much larger in universal vote-by-mail districts (37.6%) than in non-universal vote-by-mail districts (11.5%), in 2020 compared to 2016.</p><p>We now look at the effects of sending mail ballots to all registered voters on voter turnout (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>, right panel). For non-permanent absentee voters, turnout in nonuniversal vote-by-mail districts is 3.2 percentage points lower in 2020 compared to 2016, while turnout in universal vote-by-mail districts remains the same. The result indicates a boost of 3.2 percentage points in turnout across Los Angeles County attributable to the policy, according to our difference-in-differences estimate.

In terms of voter demographics, we find that older voters, female voters, and White voters are much more likely to turn out to vote compared to younger voters, male voters, and racial minority voters, respectively. Regarding neighborhood socioeconomic characteristics, we find that less educated neighborhoods and less affluent neighborhoods have lower voter turnout compared to their more educated and affluent counterparts. There is also heterogeneity in treatment effects by these demographics and neighborhood socioeconomic characteristics, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>. While turnout among female voters and turnout among male voters are equally boosted by universal voting by mail, the policy has a larger effect on older voters than younger voters, and a larger effect on racial minority voters, especially Hispanic voters and Asian voters, than White voters. Regarding neighborhood socioeconomic characteristics, the effect on voter turnout is larger in more affluent neighborhoods than their less affluent counterparts.</p><p>Neighborhoods with various levels of education attainments all receive a boost in voter turnout due to the policy.</p><p>We further incorporate voter demographics and neighborhood (Census block group) socioeconomic characteristics in our difference-in-differences design following Callaway Note: The three figures on the left display the difference-in-differences estimates by age group, gender, and race/ethnicity, respectively.

In this section, we take advantage of individual-level administrative records with geo-locations to conduct further analysis using geographic boundary-based designs.</p><p>We Results from this geographic boundary-based analysis are presented in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref> for non-permanent absentee voters and Figure SI.12 for permanent absentee voters.</p><p>Similar to the difference-in-differences results, sending mail ballots to all registered voters dramatically increased the likelihood of voting by mail for non-permanent absentee voters, who are directly impacted by the policy. Moreover, we find that non-permanent 14 In the previous version of this paper, we were only able to geo-locate registered voters residing within 2 kilometers of the boundary due to resource constraints. We also run the analyses with various radii as robustness checks below, and the results are similar. 15 Table SI.9 and Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">SI</ref>.10 show the demographic and socioeconomic composition of registered voters residing near the boundary of universal and non-universal vote-by-mail districts compared to the county at large. There is a higher concentration of Hispanic voters living in these areas, and more houses are valued at a lower price close to the boundary compared to other parts of the county. absentee voters are more likely to turn out in universal vote-by-mail districts than nonuniversal vote-by-mail districts, by 3.7 percentage points. By contrast, the difference in turnout between universal vote-by-mail districts and non-universal vote-by-mail districts is substantively smaller (1.6 percentage points) and statistically indistinguishable from zero for permanent absentee voters.</p><p>We conducted a few additional analyses in the Supplementary Information. First, we vary the distance from the boundary within which registered voters were included in the analysis. As Figure SI.13 shows, the estimates for non-permanent absentee voters stay around the same across different distances. Second, we exclude a varying number of registered voters who reside closest to the boundary in "donut" regression discontinuity designs <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Eggers et al., 2015)</ref>. As elections under the same district map, the estimates for non-permanent absentee voters are statistically indistinguishable from zero and substantively small. 16   We also look at whether sending mail ballots to all registered voters has different effects on voters of different party registrations (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7</ref>). We find that the boost in turnout among non-permanent absentee voters is larger for registered Democrats and registered Republicans than voters registered without a party affiliation, with the point estimate for registered Democrats (5.2%) close to registered Republicans (4.7%).</p><p>There are, however, still imbalances in voter characteristics in the vicinity of the boundary of universal and non-universal vote-by-mail districts (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">SI</ref>.12), which is perhaps unsurprising given that district lines in California, like in many states, are drawn in a way that often (but not always) respects community boundaries. In light of the challenges, we conduct a series of analyses where we match registered voters close to the boundary on observable characteristics and conduct a series of difference-in-differences analyses on the matched sets of voters. After matching on demographics including age, gender, and race/ethnicity, the estimated effects on non-permanent absentee voters within various distances to the boundary range from 3.5 to 4.3 percentage points. We further match on neighborhood median house value (via coarsened exact matching, with balances after matching in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">SI</ref>.13), our main covariate capturing neighborhood 16 And the only exception is a negative estimate for the 2016 primary election.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Discussion</head><p>Past research examining the implications of universal voting-by-mail on voter turnout has generally been conducted across election jurisdictions, sometimes across states, sometimes within states but across counties. But since counties in these states are the unit of election administration, this means that across-jurisdiction studies may have potential confounding factors that might have biased their results. Also, in many of the places where universal voting-by-mail has been implemented, the transition was accompanied by other important changes in election administration that are difficult or impossible to account for in any analysis of how universal voting-by-mail might affect voter turnout.</p><p>In contrast, our study is the first that examines how universal voting-by-mail affects voter turnout within a jurisdiction. We do this by taking advantage of a unique aspect of election administration in the 2020 primary elections in Southern California. As Of course, the use of data from primary elections in a single jurisdiction raises questions about generalizability. Primary elections are known to be lower-turnout affairs, in which the costs of voting and of obtaining information are greater than in general elections <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Gerber et al., 2017)</ref>. However, previous studies (e.g., McGhee et al. 2020) have found similar effects of universal voting by mail for primary and general elections. Also, research has not come to a clear consensus on whether primary election systems like California's top-two induce changes in voter turnout <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Kousser, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Bonneau and Zaleski, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Hill, 2022)</ref>. Whether or not the results reported here generalize to general elections nationwide and to primary elections in jurisdictions with closed and partisan primaries awaits additional research. Second, our studies use data from Los Angeles County, a large and diverse election jurisdiction in Southern California, and these two election cycles had their own particular characteristics. While we recognize these potential questions, we also note that the size and diversity of Los Angeles County are comparable to (or exceed)</p><p>the size and diversity of many other American states. 17 So in our opinion, between the within-jurisdiction design of our study and the size and diversity of the election jurisdic-17 According to the U.S. Census, Los Angeles County has a total population of over 10 million as of April 2020. There are over 6 million eligible voters and 5.5 million registered voters in Los Angeles County as of February 18, 2020, two weeks before the March 2020 primary elections, according to the California Secretary of State. See SI Section 2 for further discussion of Los Angeles County and SI Section 3 for a detailed analysis of how the treatment areas compare to other congressional districts in California. tion we study, our results have external validity and thus provide important guidance for other election jurisdictions considering changing to universal voting by mail.</p><p>While we have argued strongly for the utility of a within-jurisdiction design to study convenience voting reforms (especially when the jurisdiction is large and diverse), we believe that reforms like universal voting by mail need to be studied with both withinand across-jurisdiction designs. We have argued that the within-jurisdiction design has strong internal validity, while the cross-jurisdiction design has strong external validity.</p><p>Our study is the only one that we are aware of that takes this within-jurisdiction approach to study voter turnout and universal voting by mail, and we argue that other scholars should consider similar approaches that have strong internal validity. But the crossjurisdiction design's strength (the many ways that the jurisdictions differ, thus allowing for the results from such a study to be generalized to other situations) also raises complicated methodological issues, in particular how to account for all of the differences across jurisdictions while estimating treatment effects, because the demographic, political, and administrative covariates that vary across jurisdictions are likely to be correlated with the outcomes of interest. Future research might pursue the use of causal or experimental methods to evaluate how administrative covariates might enhance the turnout effects of universal voting by mail that we estimate here. 18 In the end, because each approach has strengths relative to the other, we argue that the field of election science needs to utilize both types of research design to best make policy recommendations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusion</head><p>We have consistently shown in our paper that the use of universal voting-by-mail in the 2020 primary election in Southern California had three implications. One of the 18 For example, recent observational research on mail ballots has studied administrative differences in rejection rates <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Baringer, Herron and Smith, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Shino, Suttmann-Lea and Smith, 2022)</ref>. Future research on UVBM might try to estimate the causal effects of different UVBM administrative procedures on voter turnout.</p><p>implications is perhaps unsurprising, but among non-permanent voters in the universal voting-by-mail areas, they were much more likely to vote by mail in the 2020 primary. Thus, sending these registered voters a ballot in the mail made it more likely that they would return their ballot by mail.</p><p>Second, and of more importance to researchers and policymakers, we have found that for non-permanent registered voters in the universal voting-by-mail areas, sending them a ballot in the mail increased their likelihood of turning out to vote in the primary election. The estimated increase in turnout varied slightly across our various analyses, but was consistently positive and statistically significant, at around 3 to 4 percentage points. This is a considerable boost in voter turnout.</p><p>Third, when we looked for partisan heterogeneity in the effects of universal voting-bymail on turnout, we found that turnout increased for registered Democrats, Republicans, and those with No Party Preference; generally, we found that turnout increased greater for registered partisans, especially Republicans, than for registered non-partisans (No Party Preference). This is consistent with some previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Berinsky, Burns and Traugott, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Berinsky, 2005</ref>) that find higher-propensity voters are more likely to be affected by voting-by-mail reforms. Moreover, we found that in our countywide analyses, registered Republicans who were subjected to the policy were more likely to turn out to vote than were registered Democrats. Our results also indicate that there is heterogeneity among different demographic and socioeconomic groups in the effects of the policy. Additional studies with strong internal validity need to unpack the mechanisms underlying these heterogeneous effects.</p><p>During the 2020 presidential general election, many states, like California, shifted to universal voting-by-mail as a means to conduct large-scale elections during the COVID-19 pandemic. California will continue to use universal voting-by-mail in future statewide elections, and other states may do the same. In 2020, some states that did not shift to universal voting-by-mail did make the process of voting by mail easier for registered voters.</p><p>But we have seen other states move to restrict many "convenience" voting measures. Our results indicate that universal voting-by-mail is generally likely to produce an increase in voter turnout, meaning that states desiring to boost turnout may consider moving towards universal voting-by-mail. Our results also show that turnout rises for both Democratic and Republican voters, and perhaps that it increases slightly more for registered Republicans -a result that should be of interest to legislators and policymakers on both sides of the aisle.</p><p>Finally, while we have shown that universal voting-by-mail increased turnout in the 2020 primary election, voting-by-mail has other consequences. Past research has indicated that ballots cast by mail may lead to a higher residual vote rate, meaning that they may be more likely to have undervotes or overvotes <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Alvarez, Beckett and Stewart, 2013)</ref>. Voters returning their ballots by mail cannot take advantage of error-checking technologies that in-person voters can use. Also, some ballots sent by mail may reach election officials after the deadline, or may be lost, mis-delivered, or damaged <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Stewart, 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Stewart, , 2011))</ref>. Depending on the state law governing the process and a jurisdiction's ballot processing capacity, ballots cast by mail may take longer to process and lead to vote share shifts after Election Day <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Li, Hyun and Alvarez, 2022)</ref>. Policymakers considering universal voting-by-mail should also examine how to mitigate or eliminate these potential issues with the expansion of voting-by-mail. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Gerber, Huber, and Hill (2013)</ref> is the first paper with a clear causal design; Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref> in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Gerber, Huber, and Hill (2013)</ref> provides a nice summary of the earlier literature.

March 2020 Primary in Los Angeles County</head><p>Typically California holds statewide primaries in June of evenly-numbered years, but in 2020 the state moved the primary to early March to be one of the Super Tuesday states. The Democratic presidential primary was quite competitive in February 2020, but after the South Carolina primary on February 29, 2020, the Democratic race largely consolidated to one between Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders. Sanders ran a spirited campaign in California, and in the end, he beat Biden statewide. On the Republican side, the presidential primary was won by Donald Trump. In addition to the presidential primaries, the March 2020 primary election had the U.S. House of Representatives, State Assembly and Senate, and various local races on the ballot. Turnout statewide for this presidential primary election was 46.89% of registered voters, in the general range of turnout in recent presidential primaries in <ref type="bibr">California (47.72% in 2016 and</ref><ref type="bibr">46.78% in 2012)</ref>.</p><p>In both the 2016 and 2020 primaries, the presidential race was the biggest contest on the ballot, with 91-96% of voters who received a party ballot voting in the presidential races. A slightly smaller percentage of voters voted in the down-ballot House races (mostly in the high eighties in 2016 and low nineties in 2020 across different congressional districts in Los Angeles County). In Los Angeles County, three congressional races (two in control areas and one split between control and treated areas) in 2016 and one congressional race (in treated areas) in 2020 had no Republican candidate running, and hence slightly lower voter participation, but still 78-85% of voters voted in these races.</p><p>Overall, we see no evidence to suggest that differences in congressional races across congressional districts drive our result. It's important for our purposes to note that the VSAP innovations were implemented county-wide in the March 2020 primary, with the exception of universal voting by mail.</p></div>

The primary manifestation of these problems was that there were longer lines than anticipated in some voting locations and that some voters were unexpectedly asked to use the provisional balloting process. These issues were generally attributed to issues with the electronic pollbooks and their connectivity with the electronic voter registry. 1 These problems were generally evenly distributed throughout the county, though there were some clusters in west Los Angeles, downtown Los Angeles, and Southern Los Angeles County -in both treated and control areas with respect to universal voting by mail. 2 We have no reason to believe that these issues serve as a confounder in our analysis.</p><p>1 See the County's report on these issues, https://lavote.gov/docs/rrcc/board-correspondence/ VSAP-Board-Report.pdf?v=2 and report by researchers at Caltech and American University https://bit.ly/ 3u9sSdf.</p><p>2 See Figure <ref type="figure">9</ref>, page 17, https://bit.ly/3u9sSdf.

Congressional Districts Containing Treatment Areas</head><p>In addition to the particular context of the election that generated our observational data, the treatment was applied in specific congressional and state legislative districts in Southern California. In this section we present data about the political and demographic characteristics of the treatment areas, focusing on the five congressional districts that contain treatment areas and comparing them to the other congressional districts in California.</p><p>The argument that we make in this section using the available political and demographic data by California congressional district in 2020 is that the treatment areas in Southern California are indeed diverse in quite a number of ways. We also show that in most cases the congressional districts with treatment areas are not outliers among California congressional districts.</p><p>We  Here we do not see anything unusual about these five districts, while four of them are in the upper part of the turnout distribution they do not seem wildly atypical.    We provide summary statistics in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">SI</ref>.2. The table gives median and mean statistics for the percent Biden vote, the percent Trump vote, and the turnout among registered voters, for congressional districts with treatment areas and other other congressional districts in California. In terms of these three political features the table shows that there are no substantively significant differences between congressional districts with and without treatment areas. The mean Biden vote in congressional districts containing treatment areas is slightly higher than elsewhere in California, while the mean Trump vote is slightly lower. Turnout in the 2000 presidential general election is slightly lower in congressional districts containing treatment areas than in the other congressional districts in California.</p><p>For demographic information we use data from the California Department of Finance      </p></div>

Since almost all registered voters living in universal vote-by-mail districts reside within 10 kilometers of the boundary (Figure SI.8), we focus on the estimates from analyses on registered voters residing within 10 kilometers of the boundary. 14 Compared to the difference-in-differences design, the geographic boundarybased regression discontinuity design focuses on voters residing near the boundary of universal and non-universal vote-by-mail districts and yields a local average treatment effect. The local average treatment effect may differ from the average treatment effect for the entire county as the demographic and socioeconomic composition of the population differ.15 The geographic boundary-based regression discontinuity design offers a way to control for confounders that may remain despite leveraging only within-county variations in the difference-in-differences design.</figDesc></figure>

Our use of micro-level data, different causal inference techniques, and the examination of our data across different congressional districts help further underscore the robustness of our results. Also, our study uses data from before the time that the COVID-19 pandemic led to changes in state and county election administration later in 2020. The pandemic led many election jurisdictions (including Los Angeles County and the State of California) to change voting procedures to minimize in-person contact, and also led Los Angeles County and the state to launch new voter outreach campaigns to inform eligible citizens about safe registration and voting procedures during the general election. With the easing of pandemic restrictions, and with concerns in some states about the integrity of the voting by mail process, it is likely that in future elections we will see many of those jurisdictions alter voting procedures. While we believe our results should hold as election administration returns to normal, future research needs to revisit it once we reach a more stable situation with respect to election administration in the post-COVID environment.</figDesc></figure>

As discussed in the main text of this paper, unlike other California counties transitioning to the VCA, Los Angeles County was exempted from the provision that required sending to all registered voters countywide a mail ballot for the March 2020 primary election, even though the county did transition to the vote center/early voting model in this primary election. As part of this transition, in the 2020 March primary Los Angeles County also implemented a voting technology transition, in which in-person voters were given the option to use a new type of ballot marking device. Many other innovations in the election administration process were implemented in March 2020, part of the county's "Voting Solutions for All People" (VSAP) initiative -like redesigned mail balloting materials.</figDesc></figure>

These data compare the 53 2020 California congressional districts using the 2020 Census Redistricting File). Here we examine population density as well as the percentage white, non-Hispanics, the percentage Black, non-Hispanics, the percentage Asian, non-Hispanics, and the percentage Hispanic/Latino.InFigure SI.3 we show the distribution of California congressional districts by 2020 population density. Here we see that the congressional districts containing treatment areas are generally among the higher population density congressional districts in the state, though the range of population density among the treatment districts is considerable. As these districts are located in the more densely-populated Southern California region, this is not surprising. The next series of figures focus on race and ethnicity. In Figure SI.4 we show the distribution of 2020 California congressional districts by the percentage of their population that is white, non-Hispanic. Two congressional districts containing treatment areas (CA-47 and CA-39) have medium percentages of non-Hispanic whites in California, two congressional districts containing treatment areas (CA-38 and CA-32) have smaller percentages, and one congressional district (CA-40) has the smallest percentage of non-Hispanic whites in the state. Next in Figure SI.5 we provide the distribution of congressional districts by the percentage of their population that is Black, non-Hispanic; note that the five congressional districts containing treatment areas are scattered through the middle of this distribution. Figure SI.6 gives the distribution of 2020 California districts by the percentage of their population that is Asian, non-Hispanic. Here CA-40 is at one end of the distribution (the district with the smallest fraction of its population being Asian, non-Hispanic) while the other congressional districts containing treatment areas have above-state-median Asian, non-Hispanic populations. We see in Figure SI.7 that in terms of the percentage of each district's population that is Hispanic/Latino, the pattern is the reverse of that for non-Hispanic whites. In particular, two congressional districts containing treatment areas (CA-47 and CA-39) have medium percentages of Hispanics in California, two congressional districts containing treatment areas (CA-38 and CA-32) have larger percentages, and CA-40 has the largest percentage of Hispanics in the state. The overall pattern in terms of race and ethnicity is unsurprising given the overall population diversity in Los Angeles and the heterogeneity across the county.</figDesc></figure>

Standard errors are clustered at the (congressional and state legislative) district level. and non-universal vote-by-mail districts, and add school districts to our matching algorithms.
