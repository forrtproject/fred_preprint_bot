<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Conflict forecasting has attracted considerable attention from scholars and increasingly policymakers alike. Efforts such as a recent prediction competition sought to gather new ideas and approaches to advance the discipline, identify lessons learned, and outline avenues to improve forecasting best practices. This paper addresses three of these avenues: 1) the need to find useful ways to estimate and present uncertainty surrounding point estimate forecasts, 2) the further exploitation of latent information in conflict variables by modeling spatio-temporal dependencies and nonlinearities more directly, and 3) increased interpretability despite using complex algorithms which achieve high accuracy <ref type="bibr">(Hegre, Vesco &amp; Colaresi 2022)</ref>. This paper is a contribution to the second such competition and the wider conflict forecasting literature which introduces temporal fusion transformer models (TFTs) to predict conflict fatalities.<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> TFTs have several desirable properties: they can 1) extract more temporal and nonlinear information from the data, 2) incorporate time-invariant covariates, known past and future inputs such as elections and holidays, and other exogenous time series, 3) produce sequential forecasts over the entire prediction horizon simultaneously rather than iteratively, and 4) model prediction distributions to fully present the uncertainty of forecasts <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Lim, Arık, Loeff &amp; Pfister 2021)</ref>. As a result, TFTs are a valuable addition to a forecaster's toolkit well beyond conflict forecasting.</p><p>Previous conflict prediction efforts have mostly supplied point estimate forecasts, although there are examples going beyond that <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Brandt, Freeman &amp; Schrodt 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">, Brandt, D'Orazio, Khan, Li, Osorio &amp; Sianan 2022)</ref>. However, different audiences of conflict forecasts are interested in different aspects. Some may be interested in the most likely outcome, which corresponds to a point estimate or mean of a predictive distribution, whereas others might be interested in the range of possible outcomes and the probabilities of the most extreme outcomes, i.e. at the tails of the predictive distribution. The former can help answer questions such as how many fatalities are likely in country x at time y while the latter helps answer questions such as how likely is a drastic conflict escalation in country x at time y. Combining these approaches results in more nuanced and balanced forecasts with uncertainty such that users know both what the most likely outcome is, how likely it actually is, and what the range of plausible outcomes is <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Gleditsch 2022)</ref>. This is important information for researchers, decision-makers, or any consumer of forecasts beyond conflict.</p><p>Novel and sophisticated algorithms have been used recently to improve our collective ability to predict conflict intensity <ref type="bibr">(Hegre, Vesco &amp; Colaresi 2022</ref>). However, these oftentimes complex models tend to perform quite well individually at the expense of interpretability <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Vesco, Hegre, Colaresi, Jansen, Lo, Reisch &amp; Weidmann 2022)</ref>. Some users or consumers of conflict forecasts might be more interested in knowing which factors influence forecasts most rather than having highly accurate forecasts without interpretability <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Gleditsch 2022)</ref>. After all, early warning can only work well if we know what change or action is required to prevent or mitigate escalation. We provide evidence for several forecasting windows to evaluate the performance of the TFT model and demonstrate that TFTs predict conflict intensity with high accuracy while enabling interpretability. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">2</ref>The paper is structured as follows. First, we briefly review recent efforts to forecast conflict intensity and the particular challenges involved. We subsequently describe transformer models in general and the temporal fusion transformer model in particular. After presenting the data and providing more technical details about the modeling approach, we discuss the results on the country-and grid cell-month level as units of analysis. We conclude by outlining limitations and avenues for future research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Conflict forecasting (and its limits)</head><p>Recent efforts to forecast conflict intensity have introduced both novel data sources and algorithms. Information from newspaper articles <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Mueller &amp; Rauh 2022)</ref> or internet searches <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Oswald &amp; Ohrenhofer 2022)</ref> for example have the potential to pick up early signs of tensions before escalation due to their fast-changing nature <ref type="bibr">(Hegre, Vesco &amp; Colaresi 2022)</ref>. Furthermore, algorithms such as recurrent neural networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Radford 2022</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">, Malone 2022)</ref> or dynamic time warping <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Chadefaux 2022</ref>) have shown promising predictive performance. However, the overarching challenge is that complex algorithms tend to perform well and quite accurately but oftentimes provide little interpretability <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Vesco et al. 2022)</ref>. Meanwhile, consumers of conflict forecasts are at least as interested in knowing which factors contribute to changes in conflict intensity as they are in having accurate forecasts <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Gleditsch 2022</ref>). It may be of higher value for decision-makers to know which factors contribute to an increased conflict intensity risk since it provides them with actionable information on which prevention and mitigation strategies might be more or less effective.</p><p>Part of the modeling approach is a need to extract more latent information from conflict variables such as spatial and temporal dependencies and nonlinear relationships <ref type="bibr">(Hegre, Vesco &amp; Colaresi 2022)</ref>. Conflict variables are by and large the best and most reliable predictors for future intensity <ref type="bibr">(Hegre, Bell, Colaresi, Croicu, Hoyles, Jansen, Leis, Lindqvist-McGowan, Randahl, Rød &amp; Vesco 2021</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">, Bazzi, Blair, Blattman, Dube, Gudgeon &amp; Peck 2022)</ref>. Finding algorithms which are able to exploit nonlinearities and dependencies in these conflict variables are, in the absence of new data sources and improved quality of existing data sources, the forecaster's best bet to improve predictive performance. However, this added layer of complexity should not come at the expense of interpretability.</p><p>Lastly, there are only few previous studies which supplied conflict forecasts with measures of uncertainty <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Brandt, Freeman &amp; Schrodt 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">, Brandt et al. 2022)</ref>. Providing uncertainty around point estimates is useful for researchers and consumers of forecasts alike and has to be reported in clear ways <ref type="bibr">(Hegre, Vesco &amp; Colaresi 2022)</ref>. Practicioners and decision-makers would not only like to know the most likely outcome, i.e. the point estimate of predicted fatalities, but also how likely this most likely outcome is, how likely more extreme outcomes are, and what the range of plausible outcomes is <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Gleditsch 2022)</ref>. It is also of interest to producers and consumers of forecasts to evaluate with how much confidence the models were on or off target. In sum, conflict forecasts will be more valuable for consumers if they can exploit spatial or temporal dependencies and nonlinearities from conflict variables, and provide measures of uncertainty and some level of interpretability while upholding accuracy levels. The temporal fusion transformer can provide all of these at no expense to accuracy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">The temporal fusion transformer model</head><p>A transformer model is a neural network, a deep learning approach, which can learn context and meaning by observing connections in sequential data such as time series. The attention mechanism characterizing transformer models is capable of discovering influences and dependencies between variables and data points. A transformer model consists of encoder/decoder blocks which process data. These positional encoders mark data points going through the network and attention units follow these markers to create a map of relationships between elements <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Vaswani, Shazeer, Parmar, Uszkoreit, Jones, Gomez, Kaiser &amp; Polosukhin 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Temporal fusion transformers (TFTs) are attention-based deep neural networks designed to provide both good performance and interpretability. The main characteristic differentiating them from standard transformer models is that they specifically utilize the selfattention mechanism to identify complex temporal patterns in multiple time series. TFTs have additional desirable features for conflict forecasting and beyond. First, a model can be trained on multiple multivariate time series. Second, TFTs provide multi-horizon forecasts with prediction intervals. Third, they support different types of features such as time-variant and -invariant exogenous variables. Fourth, they provide interpretability via variable importance, seasonality, and extreme event detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Lim et al. 2021)</ref>. Lastly, TFTs, and transformer models more generally, have been shown to outperform statistical, machine learning and other deep learning models, including, for example, gradientboosted trees and Deep Space-State Models <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Elsayed, Thyssens, Rashed, Jomaa &amp; Schmidt-Thieme 2021</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">, Lim et al. 2021</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">, Makridakis, Spiliotis, Assimakopoulos, Semenoglou, Mulder &amp; Nikolopoulos 2023)</ref>.</p><p>Incorporating different types of features distinguishes TFTs from other well-known deep learning time-series models such as Deep AR <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Salinas, Flunkert, Gasthaus &amp; Januschowski 2020)</ref>. More specifically, it can include known and unknown time-varying and real and categorical time-invariant features. Known features refer to for example holidays or election dates which are known for both the past and the future. Unknown features are e.g. the number of violent events or deaths in the past which we do not know for the prediction period. Examples of time-invariant real, meaning numerical, features can be country or gridcell identifiers. Time-invariant categorical features may include variables such as geographic region or continent <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Lim et al. 2021)</ref>.</p><p>Models producing multi-horizon forecasts can generally be grouped into two categories: iterated and direct approaches. Iterated approaches use autoregressive models and forecast one step into the future to subsequently feed this prediction into the model to generate the forecast two steps into the future and so forth. Deep AR as a Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) network and Deep State-Space Models fall into this category. In contrast, direct approaches are rooted in sequence-to-sequence models and produce all forecasts for the defined prediction horizon simultaneously. TFTs fall in this category of direct approaches. The main advantage of direct approaches, and the TFT in particular, is that they can incorporate past and future time-varying inputs easily whereas iterated approaches rest on the assumption that all feature values are known for the future such that only the outcome needs to be fed into the model again repeatedly <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Lim et al. 2021)</ref>. The ability to incorporate different types of features and to produce direct forecasts go hand in hand for TFTs.</p><p>A common criticism of so-called black-box models is that they are overly complex and contain nonlinear interactions between numerous parameters, which is one reason for limited interpretability <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Lim et al. 2021)</ref>. At its core, a TFT consists of four individual components: a Gated Residual Network (GRN), a Variable Selection Network (VSN), a LSTM Encoder Decoder Layer, and an Interpretable Multi-Head Attention mechanism. In addition, a fifth component in the form of quantile regression can be added to estimate prediction intervals alongside point predictions. The GRN controls if and to what extent we allow nonlinearities to enter the modeling process. Put differently, TFTs have the ability and flexibility to decide whether it is necessary with the data at hand to introduce nonlinear relationships or whether it is better to keep the model simple and suppress nonlinear contributions. It thus enables complexity to enter the modeling process while keeping all desirable features mentioned above, in contrast to introducing complexity by default <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Lim et al. 2021)</ref>.</p><p>The main task of any forecasting model is to predict a point estimate of the target variable. However, we are oftentimes as much or even more interested in the uncertainty of predictions in the form of prediction intervals. Forecasts have to convey the uncertainty surrounding point predictions if we want research to be useful for decision-makers or international organizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Gleditsch 2022)</ref>. TFTs can use quantile regression, an extension of the standard linear regression, which estimates the conditional median of the target variable and for example the 0.25 and 0.75 quantiles, or any percentiles we want, such that the model can deliver a prediction interval around the actual point prediction. We can choose whether to minimize the quantile loss function or other functions such as the mean squared error or the mean absolute percentage error <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Lim et al. 2021)</ref>. TFTs thus provide several options to convey uncertainty and compute prediction intervals.</p><p>Lastly, interpretability and explainability have received increased attention lately. Many complex algorithms tend to achieve high accuracy at the expense of explainability <ref type="bibr">(Hegre, Vesco &amp; Colaresi 2022)</ref>. However, especially in early warning settings, it might be more useful for decision-makers to know which variables or factors are more important than others to get a better idea of what can be done to prevent or mitigate conflicts from intensifying rather than having highly accurate forecasts but not knowing which factors were most influential in producing these forecasts <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Gleditsch 2022)</ref>. TFTs provide interpretability for features, seasonality, and extreme events. The integrated Variable Selection Network can compute feature importance scores by analyzing weights attached to them in the test set. Seasonality is taken into consideration by identifying persistent temporal patterns via attention weight patterns to identify more important past time steps which influence the forecasts. Lastly, time series are vulnerable to sudden shocks caused by rare events, and oftentimes we do not know whether there are hidden persistent patterns in the data which a model cannot identify or whether it is simply random noise. TFTs provide the option of analyzing each feature across its entire distribution of values to check the robustness of the model and reveal whether hidden patterns might be present <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Lim et al. 2021</ref>). There are thus several layers of interpretability and explainability directly tied to the model. In sum, a TFT is well positioned to contribute to our collective conflict forecasting efforts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Data and methods</head><p>The outcome of interest is the count of fatalities resulting from state-based armed conflict, i.e. from violence between a government and an organized rebel group which leads to at least 25 battle-related deaths per year. Data from 1990 until April 2024 come from the Uppsala Conflict Data Program (UCDP)'s Georeferenced Event and Candidate Events Datasets <ref type="bibr">(Davies, Pettersson &amp; Öberg 2023</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">, Hegre, Croicu, Eck &amp; Högbladh 2020)</ref>. We forecast the outcome for country-and PRIO-GRID cell-months as units of analysis. Countries are defined per the updated and revised Gleditsch-Ward list of independent states <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Gleditsch &amp; Ward 1999)</ref>. PRIO-GRID is a standardized and static spatial grid structure of the world which consists of quadratic cells at a resolution of 0.5 x 0.5 decimal degrees <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Tollefsen, Strand &amp; Buhaug 2012)</ref>. Analyses on the country-month level have global coverage whereas analyses on the PRIO-GRID-month level are restricted to Africa and the Middle East.</p><p>We forecast the number of fatalities twelve months into the future based on data up until and including October of the preceding year. We repeat this for six individual years from 2018 through 2023 and evaluate the TFT against benchmark models from the awardwinning Violence and Impacts Early-Warning System <ref type="bibr">(Hegre et al. 2021)</ref>. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">3</ref> We mostly rely on data provided by VIEWS as part of the prediction challenge to train models. However, we add three custom features: 1) rolling 6-month z-Scores of the lagged target variable, 2) the rolling 6-month median of the lagged target variable, and 3) the rolling 6-month mean of the lagged target variable. We furthermore include information about past and future elections from the National Democratic Institute (NDI) Global Election Calendar in our countrymonth models. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_3">4</ref> The variable produced is a binary variable, indicating whether there is an election in a given country-month (CM). We also experimented with including this feature on the PRIO-GRID-month (PGM) level but found that it does not help increase predictive performance, however. We were, unfortunately, unable to include the election data for the true forecast, as NDI had not released upcoming election data for 2025.</p><p>We rely on the NeuralForecast python package provided by Nixtla (Olivares, Challú, Garza, Canseco &amp; Dubrawski 2022) to implement TFTs. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_4">5</ref> The package provides a number of convenience functions, including automatic hyperparameter tuning and various probabilistic loss functions. We train a TFT model for each test window <ref type="bibr">(2018)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2019)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2020)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2021)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2022)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2023)</ref> and level of analysis (CM and PGM). We use a Huberized Multi-Quantile loss <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Huber 1964</ref>) which is used frequently in regression tasks with outliers or heavy tails for training our models. We use the same loss function to conduct our Optuna-based hyperparameter tuning <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Akiba, Sano, Yanase, Ohta &amp; Koyama 2019)</ref>. We optimize ten model parameters: the hidden layer size, number of attention heads, learning rate, scaler type, maximum number of steps, batch size, windows batch size, random seed, input size, and step size. We obtain predictions for differing levels of uncertainty in the form of prediction intervals of 50, 60, 70, 80, and 90%. We use these intervals to sample 1000 draws from a normal distribution for each level and investigate which one produces the most performant forecasts. We find that wider confidence bands produce better performance scores at the CM level, the 80% CI producing the best results, and tighter confidence bands, e.g. 50% intervals, at the PGM level.</p><p>We evaluate model performance with three metrics: the Continuous Rank Probability Score (CRPS), the log or ignorance score (IGN), and Mean Interval Scores (MIS). CRPS measures accuracy and can be thought of as the mean absolute error equivalent for predictive distributions. Values get closer to 0 if the prediction distribution has low variance and is centered around the actual values. IGN is the log of the predictive density evaluated at the actual observation and complements CRPS. It is less concerned with the uncertainty around a prediction or the distance between prediction and observation but with the probability attributed to the actual event. Lastly, MIS strikes a balance between having fairly narrow prediction intervals and a good coverage rate. It focuses on the most likely values, penalizes increasing prediction interval size and rewards coverage <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Gneiting &amp; Raftery 2007)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Metric Calibration Sharpness Focus Nearness Propriety</head><formula xml:id="formula_0">CRPS X X - x X IGN - X X - x MIS X X - - X</formula><p>Table <ref type="table">1</ref>: Performance metrics overview These metrics capture, to varying degrees, five qualities of probabilistic forecasting systems: calibration, sharpness, focus, nearness, and propriety. Calibration captures how well the predicted frequency of y-values matches the observed frequency of y in unseen data. Sharpness refers to the concentration of the predictive distribution around the true value. Focus captures the aim of having distinctive peak(s) or high-density regions in the predictive distributions for unseen data, i.e. high probability density for events which materialize. Nearness refers to how "near", both in time and space, predictive distributions are to actual values. Lastly, propriety means that predictive distributions represent the honest beliefs of a model which is ensured by using proper scoring rules, in contrast to improper scoring rules which might reward increased certainty. Table <ref type="table">1</ref>, reproduced from <ref type="bibr">Hegre et al. (Forthcoming)</ref>, gives an overview to what extent the three metrics capture these five qualities, where X means to a large extent and x to a small extent.<ref type="foot" target="#foot_5">6</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Results</head><p>We provide results for both the country-month (CM) and PRIO-GRID cell-month (PGM) levels for six test windows from 2018 through 2023. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_6">7</ref> We compare the TFT to several VIEWS-provided benchmark models. These include on the country-month level 1) a model that bootstraps predictions from the last 20 years (Bootstrap), 2) a model that predicts from a Poisson distribution centered around the last observed values for each unit of analysis (Poisson), 3) a model that predicts zero fatalities (Zero), and 4) a model that uses the previous 12 lags of the target variable for each unit of analysis as the basis of its predictive distribution (Conflictology). On the PGM level, these benchmarks are complemented by another model which extends the Conflictology model to also include observed values from neighbouring grid cells (Conflictology N ). The main evaluation metric is the Continuous Rank Probability Score (CRPS), while the Ignorance Score (IGN) and Mean Interval Score (MIS) are used as supplementary metrics. We present results for all three metrics. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_7">8</ref>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">2</ref> shows that the TFT outperforms the benchmarks on average, as well as for almost all years when looking at the CRPS for the CM predictions. Only in 2019, where Conflictology is marginally better, and in 2022, where the Bootstrap and Zero models reach a slightly lower CRPS, does the TFT not perform best. This pattern is similar or even better when looking at the IGN and MIS evaluation. The TFT is outperforming the benchmark models across all years and on average quite considerably for the Ignorance Score and has the lowest MIS for all years except 2022. However, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">2</ref> also shows that the differences between the TFT and the best-performing benchmarks are at times not large. There are, furthermore, significant differences in performance across all models for individual months and between countries as further exemplified in the supplemental information. Still, there is substantial evidence that the TFT does perform well on the country-month level and helps improve our collective ability to forecast conflict fatalities with uncertainty.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> shows the annual aggregation evaluation scores for the TFT and benchmark us about the TFT's performance. The CRPS is the mean absolute error equivalent for probabilistic predictions and tells us how accurate forecasts are. It tells us that the TFT is among the best calibrated, sharpest, nearest, and most honest models on the PGM and even more so on the CM level. This means that the frequency of predicted and observed outcome values matches well, and that the predictive distribution is both around the true value in time and space (nearness) and concentrated around the true value (sharpness).<ref type="foot" target="#foot_8">9</ref> The Ignorance Score likewise measures sharpness and, as the only evaluation metric, focus, which tells us whether a predictive distribution has distinct high probability densities for materialized events, or in other words whether the prediction is on target with some observable level of certainty. The  Overall, the TFT produces consistently good and solid results on the CM level, with a particular advantage when evaluated using the Ignorance Score. The TFT likewise almost always performs best regarding the CRPS and MIS scores and has the lowest average score across all test windows. The results are less dominant on the PGM level, although the TFT scores best again when evaluated against the Ignorance Score across all test windows. Unlike on the CM level, it only has the best average score for the CRPS and is very narrowly beaten by one benchmark model for the MIS. This also indicates that the TFT performs close to, or at times better, than the benchmark models on the PGM level as well. While we expected the TFT to benefit from the higher disaggregation of input data on the PGM level and reach higher performance levels, the possible performance gain from more granular data may have been truncated by the problem of exceedingly high zero-inflation on the grid-cell level. useful forecasts for researchers and practitioners alike <ref type="bibr">(Hegre et al. Forthcoming)</ref>. Building on some lessons learned from the first prediction competition <ref type="bibr">(Hegre, Vesco &amp; Colaresi 2022</ref><ref type="bibr">, Vesco et al. 2022)</ref>, we contribute to these efforts by introducing the novel Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) model to predict armed conflict fatalities with uncertainty. The TFT exhibits several desirable characteristics suitable to the prediction task at hand. TFTs can be trained on multiple multivariate time series and provide probabilistic multi-horizon forecasts. They also support different types of features such as time-variant and -invariant exogenous variables as well as known future inputs, such as future election dates or holidays. Finally, they also provide interpretability via variable importance, seasonality, and extreme event detection, an important characteristic for prevention efforts. These characteristics, coupled with the TFTs ability to model linear and complex non-linear relationships, make it a promising tool for forecasting conflict and any other social phenomena.</p><p>Results for the six test windows underscore that the TFT is indeed a suitable algorithm for conflict prediction. The TFT outperforms all benchmark models for almost all years at the country-month level across all evaluation metrics. The TFT likewise shows a strong performance on the grid cell-month level, although it is less dominant compared to the country-month level. Still, there are only marginal differences to the best-performing benchmark models and it performs best on average for two out of three metrics, the third being a very close tie. It is worth noting again that the TFT dominates regarding the Ignorance Score across all levels of analysis and years, which means it was the most on-target model with some level of certainty. Overall, the TFT has theoretically desirable qualities which produce promising results in a true prediction task with real-world data. These results further underline the need to continuously evaluate a diverse set of models for conflict forecasting. We also hope to have demonstrated that the Temporal Fusion Transformer model can be an important tool for forecasting beyond armed conflict and that researchers will find our paper convincing to implement the TFT for their substantive interests in political or social science more generally.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0"><head>Table 2 :</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Full results for TFT and VIEWS benchmark models -country-month level models at the PGM level. It outperforms all benchmark models on average regarding the CRPS and IGN scores and gets only marginally beaten by Conflictology N with regards to the MIS score. The TFT also dominates all benchmark models for the individual years on the IGN score again. It is slightly different regarding the CRPS score for individual years, where the TFT performs best just once but is mostly quite close to the best-performing model to achieve the best averaged score across all test windows. Results are similar for the MIS score, where the TFT performs best in one year and is close to the best-performing models for other years.It is important to reiterate what the different metrics capture and what it tells</figDesc><table><row><cell>Metric</cell><cell>2018</cell><cell>2019</cell><cell>2020</cell><cell>2021</cell><cell>2022</cell><cell>2023</cell><cell>Avg.</cell></row><row><cell>CRPS</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>TFT</cell><cell>12.874</cell><cell>9.186</cell><cell>20.890</cell><cell>75.938</cell><cell>122.191</cell><cell>46.342</cell><cell>47.903</cell></row><row><cell>Bootstrap</cell><cell>23.577</cell><cell>22.458</cell><cell>31.417</cell><cell>86.626</cell><cell>120.249</cell><cell>52.722</cell><cell>56.175</cell></row><row><cell>Poisson</cell><cell>20.173</cell><cell>9.480</cell><cell>23.698</cell><cell>85.605</cell><cell>131.017</cell><cell>678.960</cell><cell>158.156</cell></row><row><cell>Zero</cell><cell>24.130</cell><cell>23.019</cell><cell>32.041</cell><cell>87.339</cell><cell>120.968</cell><cell>53.543</cell><cell>56.840</cell></row><row><cell>Conflictology</cell><cell>14.483</cell><cell>9.146</cell><cell>21.339</cell><cell>76.849</cell><cell>123.995</cell><cell>50.357</cell><cell>49.362</cell></row><row><cell>IGN</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>TFT</cell><cell>0.657</cell><cell>0.687</cell><cell>0.746</cell><cell>0.714</cell><cell>0.740</cell><cell>0.878</cell><cell>0.737</cell></row><row><cell>Bootstrap</cell><cell>1.123</cell><cell>1.111</cell><cell>1.115</cell><cell>1.152</cell><cell>1.155</cell><cell>1.154</cell><cell>1.135</cell></row><row><cell>Poisson</cell><cell>1.198</cell><cell>1.046</cell><cell>1.110</cell><cell>1.228</cell><cell>1.124</cell><cell>1.125</cell><cell>1.139</cell></row><row><cell>Zero</cell><cell>1.558</cell><cell>1.558</cell><cell>1.549</cell><cell>1.615</cell><cell>1.632</cell><cell>1.615</cell><cell>1.588</cell></row><row><cell>Conflictology</cell><cell>1.237</cell><cell>1.212</cell><cell>1.193</cell><cell>1.224</cell><cell>1.238</cell><cell>1.241</cell><cell>1.224</cell></row><row><cell>MIS</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>TFT</cell><cell cols="4">102.325 80.716 318.659 1381.931</cell><cell>2296.786</cell><cell cols="2">835.996 836.069</cell></row><row><cell>Bootstrap</cell><cell cols="2">454.090 426.006</cell><cell>606.003</cell><cell>1708.304</cell><cell>2380.744</cell><cell cols="2">1030.987 1101.022</cell></row><row><cell>Poisson</cell><cell cols="2">380.623 172.686</cell><cell>455.806</cell><cell>1690.711</cell><cell cols="3">2599.278 13523.463 3137.095</cell></row><row><cell>Zero</cell><cell cols="2">482.609 460.375</cell><cell>640.812</cell><cell>1746.780</cell><cell>2419.363</cell><cell cols="2">1070.864 1136.800</cell></row><row><cell>Conflictology</cell><cell>186.554</cell><cell>89.058</cell><cell>344.964</cell><cell cols="2">1435.555 2142.128</cell><cell>1042.916</cell><cell>873.529</cell></row></table></figure>
