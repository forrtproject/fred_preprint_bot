<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Active learning and sense of community in online classrooms have been linked to persistence, performance, and course satisfaction. A widely applied theoretical framework to describe communitybuilding through discourse and creation of meaningful learning in a classroom is the Community of Inquiry framework, which outlines relationships between social presence, teaching presence, and cognitive presence. Speaking specifically to cognitive presence, learning demands working memory resources to process information, referred to as cognitive load. Using Structural Equation Modeling, this study proposes a structural relationship between Community of Inquiry presences, cognitive load, and learner performance in asynchronous online discussions in undergraduate STEM courses. Data collected over 9 terms with over 2000 students validate the proposed structural model. By constructing a unifying model, instructors can estimate these mental constructs that cannot be directly quantified and can lead to improved outcomes for students. Future work will include developing machine learning classification techniques to further validate the model by examining presences as they occurred in the course rather than relying on students' perception of presences.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction 1.1 Active Learning Online</head><p>Recent years have seen continued growth in online undergraduate course offerings, including the asynchronous online modality (National Center for Education <ref type="bibr">Statistics, n.d.)</ref>. While not all teaching strategies are transferable to the asynchronous online modality, the online learning environment offers unique options for actively engaging students. For example, active learning, which is grounded in the constructivist theories of learning, is well-established as an andragogical strategy to promote active participation in the knowledge construction. Active learning activities include group discussions, case studies, problem-based learning, role-playing, peer review, and hands-on activities. Active learning has broad support in both the traditional learning environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Theobald et al., 2020)</ref> and the online learning environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Berssanette &amp; de Francisco, 2021)</ref>. However, some active learning tasks are better suited for synchronous engagement while others can be modified for the asynchronous modality, typically using technology tools.</p><p>In online learning, active learning has been shown to have multiple positive impacts on students, including increased course satisfaction, stronger motivation, improved mastery of learning outcomes, and development of transferable skills like critical thinking <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Berssanette &amp; de Francisco, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Rossi et al., 2021)</ref>. Students report positive views regarding the use of active learning in online courses <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Cole et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Koohang et al., 2016)</ref>. Active learning strategies that build community by engaging students with their peers and instructor can also help combat isolation that occurs in asynchronous online courses <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Croft et al., 2010)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">Online Learning Community</head><p>In the traditional classroom, active learning has been linked to improved persistence, particularly for non-traditional students <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Braxton et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Ellis, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Yu et al., 2020)</ref>. Similarly, active learning and community in online classrooms have been linked to persistence, performance, and course satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Armah et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Burch, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Jaggars &amp; Xu, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Joksimović et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Moore, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Sinclair, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Yu et al., 2020)</ref>. A widely applied theoretical framework to describe community-building through discourse and creation of meaningful learning in a classroom is the Community of Inquiry (CoI) framework, which outlines relationships between social presence, teaching presence, and cognitive presence <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Garrison &amp; Arbaugh, 2007)</ref>. The CoI framework encourages socialization (peer-to-peer and student-to-instructor) and collaborative construction of meaning through asking and answering questions, applying knowledge, defending conclusions, and more. The CoI framework has been used to promote engagement and active learning in online courses <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Irani &amp; Denaro, 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Social presence is the projection of the personality of learners and instructors into the community, with dimensions of affective responses (e.g. humor, expression of emotion, and use of paralanguage), interactive communication (e.g. reply to a peer or instructor), and cohesive responses (e.g. starting a new line of conversation and inviting a response) <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Swan &amp; Shih, 2005)</ref>. Teaching presence spans the design, direction, and facilitation of interactions (peer-to-peer and instructor-to-learner) in a course by the instructor <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Garrison &amp; Arbaugh, 2007)</ref>. Cognitive presence is the collaborative construction of meaning through discourse. Garrison contextualized the concept by describing cognitive presence as a "selfcorrecting process where members of the community challenge beliefs, suggest alternative perspectives for exploration, and negotiate understanding." <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Garrison, 2016)</ref>. Cognitive presence is operationalized through the practical inquiry model, described in four phases, with the lowest cognitive presence being triggering event (e.g. curiosity or seeking clarification), followed by exploration (e.g. stating unsubstantiated agreement/disagreement and sharing information or a content-relevant personal story) <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Garrison &amp; Arbaugh, 2007)</ref>. Next is integration, which includes building onto arguments of others, drawing conclusions, presenting justified hypotheses, or presenting a supported agreement/disagreement, followed by the highest level of cognitive presence of resolution (e.g. synthesizing, thought experiment, or application and testing of a new thought) <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Garrison &amp; Arbaugh, 2007)</ref>. In studies exploring cognitive presence in online discussions, students tend to demonstrate lower levels of cognitive presence <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Chen et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">Faulconer, Chamberlain Jr., &amp; Wood, 2022)</ref>. The presences are positively related to each other, with each presence affecting the other <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Kozan &amp; Richardson, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Lee, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Zhu, 2018)</ref>. Specifically, teaching presence and cognitive presence have shown strong correlations <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Alharbi, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Li, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Maranna et al., 2022)</ref>. Even the teaching presence of instructors who are not course designers correlate to learner cognitive presence <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Silva, 2018)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3">Drawbacks of Active Learning Online</head><p>While active learning, particularly activities grounded in CoI, may improve certain learner outcomes, this influence is not universal. Active learning in online classrooms may cause anxiety in some students <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(England et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Pilkington, 2018)</ref>. Anxiety in higher education is modified by external factors (e.g. status as an international students), internal factors (e.g. self-esteem, social anxiety and motivation), institutional factors (e.g. teaching methodology and classroom procedures) <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Eddy et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Khoshlessan &amp; Das, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Russell &amp; Topham, 2012)</ref>. Students with higher anxiety may be less likely to persist in a course and a major <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(England et al., 2017)</ref>. However, the anxiety induced in some students when engaging in collaborative active learning online may be more facilitative than debilitative and anxiety may decrease over time <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Hilliard et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>In online active learning activities, learning demands working memory resources to process information, referred to as cognitive load. Cognitive load can be described as intrinsic, extraneous, or germane. Intrinsic cognitive load is a result of the mental processing needed to understand a task, influenced by task complexity, interactivity, and the learning environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Kalyuga, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Mills, 2016)</ref>. Extraneous cognitive load is a result of how material is presented, not the learning process, and occurs when there are distractions <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Kalyuga, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Mills, 2016)</ref>. Germane cognitive load is the result of the intentional cognitive processing necessary for incorporating new information into schemata and transferring to long-term memory. High cognitive load, referred to as cognitive overload, can inhibit learning by reducing the processing of new information. Cognitive overload is typically the result of extraneous and intrinsic load <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Stiller &amp; Koster, 2016)</ref>.Germane cognitive load is considered "good" cognitive load. Intrinsic cognitive load is expected for learning tasks, but could be "bad" if the task complexity results in cognitive overload. Extraneous cognitive load is "bad" cognitive load and should be eliminated (or at least reduced) wherever possible <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Kalyuga, 2011)</ref>. Recent research suggests that teaching presence directly enhances learners' affective engagement, but also indirectly through a reduced extraneous cognitive load <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Zhang et al., 2023)</ref>.</p><p>Active learning has higher cognitive load, which may impact motivation, engagement, and selfregulation of learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Deslauriers et al., 2019)</ref>. Attrition has been correlated to cognitive load, especially when cognitive overload (often the result of extraneous and intrinsic load) occurs early in the online course <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Tyler-Smith, 2006)</ref>. Cognitive load may also influence performance in online courses <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Stachel et al., 2013)</ref>, though this relationship is complex <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Chang et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Wang et al., 2020)</ref>.Teaching presence may reduce extraneous cognitive load <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Kozan, 2015)</ref>. There is some evidence of a positive relationship between cognitive presence and cognitive load <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Kozan, 2015)</ref>, though this relationship is not reported in all studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Mills, 2016)</ref>. No studies reported a connection between learner/instructor social presence and cognitive load. Further research is needed to investigate possible relationships.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.4">Purpose</head><p>Asynchronous online courses often use online discussions to both build community and promote active learning and can be evaluated through the lens of Community of Inquiry, with each presence as distinct but interrelated <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Cho &amp; Kim, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Delaney &amp; Betts, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">deNoyelles et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Garrison, Anderson, et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Hamann et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Kozan &amp; Richardson, 2014)</ref>.

Students do value interactions with the instructor and their peers in the online classroom <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Joyner et al., 2014)</ref> but may not be engaging in the discussions with socialization as a primary reason <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bolliger &amp; Halupa, 2018)</ref>.</p><p>This study focuses on the relationship between extraneous cognitive load and community of inquiry on learner performance in asynchronous online discussions in undergraduate STEM courses. A hypothesized graph of the relations between these mental constructs, along with grades and persistence, are provided in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. However, these concepts are not discipline-specific and future work will explore these correlations in additional disciplines. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Methods 2.1 Research Site and Course Context</head><p>The population for this study consisted of students enrolled in introductory undergraduate physics and pre-calculus courses. The courses were offered at a United States medium-sized, private (not-forprofit) university with majority undergraduate enrollment, primarily nonresidential (geographically dispersed).</p><p>The courses studied were offered asynchronously online in a 9-week term, administered using a learning management system (LMS). Course templates were used, ensuring consistency across sections including course description, learning outcomes, learning objectives, textbook, multi-media resources, and student assignments and activities. This means that the primary distinction between sections of a course are human-centered, including the instructor of record and the student cohorts. Course instructors teaching the sections used in this study were both full-time faculty (of varying ranks) and contingent (adjunct) faculty.</p><p>In both courses, the discussion activities tasked students with crafting an initial post and providing thoughtful reply posts to two or more posts (instructor or student). Student participation in this course activity were graded using a rubric. In physics, 20 of 100 points were allocated to timeliness and participation, with the initial post worth 35 points and the reply posts earning 30 points. The final 15 points addressed professionalism, including spelling, grammar, organization, ethics, and netiquette. In math, 20 of 100 points were allocated to timeliness of the initial post, content of the post earns up to 40 points, at least two replies to classmates earns up to 30 points, and the remaining 10 points are for the professional writing, including the use of the Canvas equation editor for typing mathematics. In the physics course, the nine discussion activities in the course were worth 12% of the total course grade (1.33% each) while in the math course, the nine discussion activities were worth 30% of the total course grade (3.33% each).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>From the total population of students enrolled in the courses during the study time frame, the sample for survey data was determined through non-probability self-selection (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). Survey participants were recruited through LMS announcements. Participation was incentivized through a $5 ecard to a common online retailer. Census data (rather than self-selection) was used for LMS data (e.g. performance).</p><p>All data was collected confidentially, with anonymization prior to analysis through de-identification and assignment of a numeric identifier. All data were reported in aggregate with no individually identifying information. The study was reviewed by the Institutional Review Board and deemed "exempt" (#21-058). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Measures</head><p>This study used a quantitative methods approach, collecting survey data using two validated surveys as well as grade data from the Learning Management System. The first survey included 33 1 of the 34-item Community of Inquiry (CoI) instrument, which has three subscales: social, teaching, and cognitive presence <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Garrison et al., 1999</ref>). Garrison's CoI instrument has been validated, demonstrating high internal consistency and reliability <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Carlon et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Garrison, Cleveland-Innes, et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Garrison et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Shea &amp; Bidjerano, 2009)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Shea and Bidjerano (2009)</ref>   The second survey was the NASA Task Load Index instrument <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Faulconer, Bolch, et al., 2022)</ref>. The validated model for this instrument used five discrete tasks associated with engaging in asynchronous online discussions: understanding expectations, crafting an initial post, reading posts from instructors and peers, creating reply posts, and integrating instructor feedback. For each task, respondents were queried on cognitive load related to mental activity, time pressure, effort, and frustration. As illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>, Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) was used to verify the five discrete tasks could be considered as causal values on associated survey items about Mental Demand (MnA), Temporal Demand (TmP), Effort (Eff), and Frustration (Frs). Surveys were administered through Qualtrics. Academic performance data was collected from the LMS, including final course grade and individual performance on each of the nine discussions in a course.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Data Cleaning</head><p>After combining all 9 solicitations of the combined survey instrument, we had 292 respondents. We then removed all students who:</p><p>• Declined to have their data included for the study;</p><p>• Did not provide their name for anonymous linking of their survey with course grades;</p><p>• Completed less than 75% of the survey questions; and</p><p>• Completed the survey but withdrew from the course and thus we did not have course grade data available.</p><p>The remaining 278 participants were then linked with their course grades and then anonymized. All cleaning was performed in Python and scripts can be found in the GitHub (link not provided for blind review) associated with this project. Survey response columns were then renamed for descriptive clarity when visualizing the SEM models. Columns associated to the Community of Inquiry instrument were formatted as "XP_n", where X was either C (cognitive), S (social), or T (teaching) and the n represented the n th question of that presence type. For example, questions 14-22 in the Community of Inquiry instrument are theoretically caused by Social Presence and thus were written as SP_1 -SP_9. For the Cognitive Load instrument, abbreviations were formatted as "CL_XXX_n", where XXX was the cognitive load subscale abbreviated as: UE -Understanding Expectations, IP -Initial Post, RP -Reading Posts, RtP -Replying to Posts, and IF -Integrating Feedback, while the "n" represented a specific mental efforts: 1 -Mental Demand, 2 -Temporal Demand, 3 -Effort, 4 -Frustration. A full table for all abbreviations can be found in the Appendix.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Data Analysis 3.1 Structural Equation Modeling</head><p>The researchers used Structural Equation Modeling to further validate the structures of the individual instruments (Community of Inquiry instrument and the NASA-TLX). This was performed using the semopy (Structural Equation Modeling Optimization in PYthon) Python package <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Meshcheryakov et al., 2021)</ref>. Consider Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> again. The rectangular boxes are measurable values related to either the survey itself (questions 1-34) or measurable aspects about each participant (gender, age, academic level). These measurable values are assumed to be caused by the latent valuea value that cannot be measured directly. The numbers seen on arrows from the latent value (oval) to measurable values (rectangle) are the linear regression coefficient estimates. The circles are measurement errors related to each question, which is why they are perfectly correlated to each measurable value with a regression coefficient of 1. The goal of SEM is to create a linear mixed model of regression equations that can be used to estimate latent values. Thus, for each latent value, a linear regression is developed of the form:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑡 𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒 = (𝑚 1 𝑥 1 + 𝑒 1 ) + (𝑚 2 𝑥 2 + 𝑒 2 ) + ⋯ (𝑚 𝑛 𝑥 𝑛 + 𝑒 𝑛 )</formula><p>𝑥 1 , 𝑥 2 , … 𝑥 𝑛 are the measurable values assumed to be caused by the 𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑡 𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒 𝑚 𝑘 is the estimated coefficient for measurable value 𝑥 𝑘 𝑒 𝑘 is the estimated error for measurable value 𝑥 𝑘 An SEM model constructs a linear regression for each latent value based on the researcher-supplied assumptions on which measurable values are assumed to be caused by each latent value. These assumed relations form the structural model of linear regression equations. If a structural model is not known from the research literature, Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) can be performed to statistically extract the smallest number of latent values (also known as factors) that explain the covariance observed among the measurable values. Structural models can then be statistically tested to consider how well the model fits the data.</p><p>To evaluate the statistical fit of any SEM model, we use the evaluation metrics found in Table <ref type="table">2</ref> as they are calculated through semopy and are commonly used in the literature to evaluate the statistical fit of an SEM model <ref type="bibr">(Hoyle, 2012)</ref>. The exact meaning and calculation of each evaluation metric is beyond the scope of this paper. However, it is important to note that numerous authors caution against hard cutoffs for evaluation metrics as model and data characteristics can affect evaluation metrics <ref type="bibr">(Hoyle, 2012)</ref>. For example, the number of factors, when holding all else constant, tends to decrease <ref type="bibr">CFI and TLI (Kenny &amp; McCoach, 2003)</ref>. Therefore, we are willing to accept evaluation values slightly below target when the model provides a theoretically-sound structure, such as mirroring validated structural models in the literature using the same survey instrument to collect data.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Structural Equation Modeling for Community of Inquiry</head><p>An SEM model for Community of Inquiry was presented by <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Shea and Bidjerano (2009)</ref> in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>. We first replicated the same structure with our own data as seen in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref>. Evaluative metrics for the Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref> model are:</p><p>• RMSEA=0.15 (target &lt;0.1) • CFI=0.67 (target &gt;0.9) • GFI=0.64 (target &gt;0.9) • TLI=0.65 (target &gt;0.95) By all metrics, this was a poor structural model for our data. To determine a more appropriate structural model that fit our data, we conducted an Exploratory Factor Analysis which suggested intermediate latent factors as presented in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5</ref>. Evaluative metrics for the model are:</p><p>• RMSEA=0.08 (target &lt;0.1) • CFI=0.92 (target &gt;0.9) • GFI=0.88 (target &gt;0.9) • TLI=0.91 (target &gt;0.95) Noting the soft nature of our evaluation targets and that GFI and TLI in particular can be negatively influenced by number of factors (which we increased by adding intermediate latent factors), we find this model adequately fits our data. Of note are the regression coefficients for the intermediate teaching latent factors. While one latent factor is always fixed to 1, the others have negative regression coefficients. The intermediate factor latent_tp1 loads onto questions about instructor communication (e.g., clearly communicated course topics, goals, instructions on how to participate, and important due dates), latent_tp2 loads onto questions involving course participants in general (e.g., guiding class towards understanding, keeping course participants engaged and on task, and reinforcing sense of community), and latent_tp3 loads onto questions involving instructor feedback (e.g., feedback for understanding and in a timely fashion). Descriptive statistics provide some reasoning for the change in regression coefficient signs: latent_tp1 questions had mean scores of about 2.9 and standard deviation of about 1.6 while the other teaching presence questions had averages of at least 4 and standard deviation of about 1.2. Since the average scores that latent_tp2 and latent_tp3 were far higher than those of latent_tp1, the regression coefficients were negative to compensate for this difference.</p><p>SEM models also provide covariation between latent values (seen as dotted bi-directional arrows) as well as a hypothesis test p-value on whether the two latent values covary independently (null hypothesis) or jointly (alternatively hypothesis). Correlation is a normalized version of covariance. Like correlation, covariance near 0 means that the two latent factors do not relate to one another. Covariation and p-values for latent values of the model are:</p><p>• teaching and social: covariance = -0.127, p-value = 0.00</p><p>• teaching and cognitive: covariance = -0.186, p-value = 0.00</p><p>• social and cognitive: covariance = 0.498, p-value = 0.00 At all significance levels, we have statistically significant evidence to reject that each pair of latent values covary independently. For teaching and social/cognitive latent values, as teaching presence increases, social/cognitive presence decreases. Both covariances are near 0 though, so this would be described as a weak negative covariance. For social and cognitive latent values, we found a moderate positive covariance.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Structural Equation Modeling for Cognitive Load</head><p>To • RMSEA=0.13 (target &lt;0.1)</p><p>• CFI=0.87 (target &gt;0.9) • GFI=0.84 (target &gt;0.9) • TLI=0.84 (target &gt;0.95)</p><p>The factor analysis provides a marginal improvement to the CFI metric (+0.01) and otherwise no change in the evaluative metrics.

The evaluative metrics match the metrics for the Cognitive Load SEM model separately, which suggests it fits our data adequately. However, we recognize that Exploratory Factor Analysis does not provide layers of latent factors in its analysis. By combining the SEM models we identified separately for presence, cognitive_load, and grades, we may arrive at an SEM model that better fits our data. Unlike previous models, the GFI differs drastically from CFI and TLI. GFI (Goodness of Fit Index) is an absolute index, which describes the fit of data as compared to population covariance and assumes that the best-fit model accounts for all variance of factors. GFI is sensitive to variance in a small number of factors. In contrast, CFI and TLI are comparative indices, which describe the fit of variances in the data and compares the data fit to the assumption that there is no relationship among variables. The lower absolute index suggests there is covariance we are not accounting for with our model, but that the model does describe the variance of individual measurable values and latent factors well.</p><p>As covariation and p-values in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">11</ref> are impossible to read, they are provided in Table <ref type="table">7</ref>.</p><p>presence cognitive_load grades teaching -0.038 (0.05) -0.087 (0.04) 0.043 (0.07) social 0.167 (0.00) 0.255 (0.00) -0.152 (0.00) cognitive 0.851 (0.00) -0.316 (0.00) 0.229 (0.00) presence -0.320 (0.00) 0.209 (0.00) cognitive_load -0.320 (0.00) -0.227 (0.01) grades 0.209 (0.00) -0.227 (0.01)</p><p>Table 7: Covariation and p-value among top-level latent factors as well as intermediate Community of Inquiry factors.  Note that teaching does not provide statistically significant results to suggest it varies with total Community of Inquiry presence as well as grades. The teaching factor has low covariation with cognitive-_load as well. While teaching may influence other latent factors (as we saw when examining the Community of Inquiry SEM model separately), it does not covary with the other latent factors. This is not too surprising as teaching is the only latent factor related to the instructor directly and all other factors relate to the student directly. Cognitive load appears to have a mild negative relationship with all latent factors expect social presence. Social presence and cognitive load also have a mild negative relationship with grades while cognitive presence and total presence have a positive relationship with grades.

Thus, we should consider this as an oversimplified model for generally describing the overall SEM model and not for accurately estimating latent factors.

We found statistically significant evidence that total Community of Inquiry presence, Cognitive Load, and grades showed mild covariance with one another. When we investigated Community of Inquiry teaching, social, and cognitive presences, we found that teaching presence did not provide evidence of covarying with total presence nor with grades and only showed low negative covariance with cognitive load which does not match results from the literature <ref type="bibr">(Ice et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Lee, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Silva, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Zhu, 2018)</ref>.

As expected from the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Jo et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Stachel et al., 2013)</ref>, cognitive presence showed a mild negative covariance with cognitive load and mild positive covariance with grades. However, social presence showed a mild positive covariance with cognitive load and mild negative covariance with grades, again not matching results from the literature (Hostetter, 2013), which will require further exploration to definitively explain. One potential explanation for the mild negative covariance between grades and social presence may involve instructors not valuing or including social moves with a grade. Evaluative metrics for our integrated SEM model suggested a strong fit, with RMSEA=0.07 (target &lt;0.1), CFI=0.87 (target &gt;0.9), GFI=0.79 (target &gt;0.9), TLI=0.86 (target &gt;0.95).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Implications</head><p>Numerous studies have explored and confirmed relationships between Community of Inquiry presences as well as between presences and learner outcomes such as performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Maranna et al., 2022)</ref>. However, these relationships did not consider the role of cognitive load in this relationship between CoI presences and learner performance. Our results suggest teaching and cognitive presences have a negative covariance with cognitive load (e.g., as cognitive presence increases, cognitive load decreases) while social presence has a positive covariance with cognitive load (e.g., as social presence increases, cognitive load increases). The overall Community of Inquiry presence, as perceived by the student, negatively covaries with cognitive load (e.g., as CoI presence increases, cognitive load decreases). These results combined confirm that there are different types of cognitive load (germane, extraneous), that presence can both increase some cognitive load (germane) while decreasing other cognitive load (extraneous), and that CoI presences covary in complex ways with cognitive load and student performance. Potentially surprisingly, teaching presence was the only Community of Inquiry presence without statistical evidence to suggest it covaried with student performance. This provides evidence to further encourage active learning where students are the center of the learning experience as their social and cognitive presences more closely relate to outcomes that the instructor's interventions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations and Future Directions</head><p>This study presents a structural model to estimate Community of Inquiry and Cognitive Load in a unified method. However, there are numerous limitations to accepting this structural model as universal. Data was collected from a single university that is not representative of all college-level education. Data consisted of students' perceptions of Community of Inquiry presences and Cognitive Load subscales rather than measures of students' actions in a course, which may differ <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Ozogul, Zhu, &amp; Phillips, 2022)</ref>. The response rate for student participation was 13%, which was below our target rate of 20% and thus may not have been representative of our student population. Participation in the survey was voluntary, which may have introduced confirmation and other biases to the data. Participation in the survey was limited to two introductory-level courses in Physics and Mathematics, which may not be representative of all introductory-level STEM courses nor all undergraduate-level STEM courses. We acknowledge these limitations and plan to address them with future work. Specifically, we have two methods address the majority of these limitations: (1) qualitatively categorize discussion post sentences by students and instructors according to the Community of Inquiry framework as a direct measure of student actions to estimate Community of Inquiry presences and (2) conduct the same survey on an expanded participant poll in other introductory-level STEM courses both at the same institution and others to provide further evidence for the structural model. We also plan to employ machine learning classification methods, such as random decision forests, to scale-up the qualitative categorization of discussion post sentences for real-time estimates of Community of Inquiry presences that can be used to improve students' educational experiences.</p><p>q33 CP_11 Cognitive Presence 11 q34 CP_12 Cognitive Presence 12</p><p>Table 8: Abbreviations for Community of Inquiry and Cognitive Load Instruments.

For teaching and social/cognitive latent values, as teaching presence increases, social/cognitive presence decreases. Both covariances are near 0 though, so this would be described as a weak negative covariance. For social and cognitive latent values, we found a moderate positive covariance.

Evaluative metrics for our Cognitive Load SEM model suggested a fit, with RMSEA=0.13 (target &lt;0.1), CFI=0.87 (target &gt;0.9), GFI=0.84 (target &gt;0.9), TLI=0.84 (target &gt;0.95).</p></div>
