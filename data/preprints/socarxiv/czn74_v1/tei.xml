<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Across Europe, women receive on average substantially less pension income than men (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Tinios et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Hammerschmid and Rowold 2019)</ref>. In light of the ageing population, these Gender Pension Gaps (GPG) are a pressing matter not just for current cohorts but will increasingly affect a growing number of women in the future. While women might share financial resources on household level, household contexts have become more uncertain. For example, the divorce rates among the old age population increase (gray divorce revolution, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Brown and Wright 2017)</ref>, and the share of elderly women living in single-households is higher compared to men <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Ahonen and Kuivalainen 2024)</ref>. Consequently, a sufficient personal pension is becoming increasingly crucial to prevent women's currently higher vulnerability to old-age poverty compared to men in most European countries in the future <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Ahonen and Kuivalainen 2024)</ref>. Moreover, understanding the causes of gender inequalities in pension income is politically extremely relevant <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Kuitto et al. 2021)</ref>, especially with the rise of private pensions. This shift makes elderly individuals who rely on the redistribution of public pensions, predominantly women, more vulnerable.</p><p>Empirical studies predominantly apply decomposition methods and focus on women's lack of (full-time) employment as a driver of the GPG (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Frommert and Strauß 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Hänisch and Klos 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Cordova et al. 2022</ref>). However, the accumulation of pension entitlements is likely to be more complex, to go beyond gender differences in (full-time) employment and to differ by pension type.</p><p>The present study adds to the literature by examining underlying heterogeneities regarding gendered work-family life-course independences, the differences between public and private pensions, and the role of earnings over the life course. Its focus on West Germany provides a relevant context for high gender inequalities in the labour market and a comparatively high GPG with women receiving only about half of the average pension income of men <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Hammerschmid and Rowold 2019)</ref>. West Germany is the ideal context for contributing to the literature illustrating how high levels of gender inequalities in pre-retirement ages are reproduced by strongly earnings-related pension institutions across pension income types.</p><p>This article adopts a life-course perspective to examine how gendered work-family life-course patterns interact with different pension pillars in later life, and how these interactions contribute differently to gender gaps in public and private pensions. Specifically, I focus on two main questions:</p><p>To what extent are gendered work-family life courses, including earnings over the life course, associated with the Gender Pension Gap?</p><p>How do these associations vary between the gender gap in public compared to private pensions?</p><p>To address these questions, I use rich linked survey-register data, which provide a unique opportunity to study public and private pension income with detailed and reliable work-family life course information, including relative earnings, and make three main contributions.</p><p>First, the scientific discourses are criticised for focussing on employment mostly when it comes to old age income security <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Frericks 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Rowold et al. 2024</ref>) and neglect the theoretically important interdependences of employment and family life-course complexities for analysing Gender Pensions Gaps <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Allmendinger et al. 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Ginn et al. 2001)</ref>. Previous decomposition studies on GPGs do not consider family lives and life-course complexities in detail. They i) simplify life courses by only considering one-dimensional summary measures (most commonly the employment duration), ii) focus on a very limited number of employment lifecourse elements due to multicollinearity, and iii) do not consider the interaction between family and work lives <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Rowold et al. 2024)</ref>.</p><p>I address these shortcomings by applying the novel SA-KOB decomposition which quantifies the association of multidimensional life course patterns with the GPG, thereby overcoming the limitations of the standard approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Rowold et al. 2024</ref>). In the first step, Multichannel Sequence Analysis identifies common work-family life-course patterns, i.e., grouping life courses in which work and family states occur in a similar manner. In a second step, I decompose the GPG based on group membership in these life-course patterns revealing i) which part of the GPG is due to the gendered segregation on different work-family life courses and, ii) which part is due to unequal rewards for the same life-course pattern. This approach provides a comprehensive understanding of the complexities inherent in real-life situations, such as the interdependence between work and family, and their relationship to the GPG. It thereby helps to avoid overlooking the impact of certain lived realities.</p><p>Second, private (occupational and personal) pensions are identified as particularly disadvantageous for women, with gender gaps therein being particularly high (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Ginn 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Frommert 2020</ref>). However, the only studies that have assessed gendered private pension income have focused on the Beveridgean pension context of the UK and applied only lifecourse summary measures <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bardasi and Jenkins 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Gardiner et al. 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Ezeyi and Vujic 2017)</ref>. The current literature misses a clear empirical assessment of what the current pension privatisation in Europe <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Ebbinghaus 2011</ref>) means for GPGs in other pension systems and how gender inequalities in public and private pensions are differently related to gender inequalities in pre-retirement life courses from a holistic perspective. This study fills this gap by decomposing gender gaps in public and private pension income separately for the German context.</p><p>Third, previous literature was unable to consider earnings over the life course for decomposing GPGs. Consequently, it is currently unclear how gendered earnings inequalities, as they move over the life course, translate into gendered pension income inequalities in old age. This, however, is pressing given that the gender pay gap is at high levels in most European countries, especially in those with high female labour participation (Schmieder and Wrohlich 2021), suggesting that female full-time employment alone may not be sufficient to prevent high GPGs. This is particularly pertinent in Germany where the Gender Wage Gap persists at high levels over decades <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Schmieder and Wrohlich 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Schmitt and Auspurg 2022)</ref>. My approach represents a novel contribution to the literature, as it decomposes GPGs based on individuals' relative earnings positions over the life course and goes beyond the annual employment status that has been assessed predominantly in the literature so far. Earning differences over the life course likely play a particularly important role for the gender gap in private pensions since earnings determine access and endowment with occupational and personal pensions <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Geyer et al. 2021)</ref>.</p><p>In light of pension privatisation, it is crucial to understand how work-family life courses and earnings contribute to gender gaps in different pension types, enabling policymakers to effectively reduce gendered pension disparities in the future.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Theoretical and institutional background 2.1 Empirical evidence</head><p>The standard approach in the literature analyses the GPG directly by decomposing it into a part that is due to differences in endowments with characteristics (e.g., most commonly years spent in full-time employment) and a part that is due to different returns for the same characteristic (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Even and Macpherson 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bardasi and Jenkins 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Bonnet et al. 2020)</ref>. In line with the international literature, all decomposition studies in Germany found that the difference in years men and women have been full-time employed is the main reason for the GPG <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Frommert and Strauß 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Hänisch and Klos 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Cordova et al. 2022)</ref>. Some studies also highlight the relevance of income differences at varying points in the life course (e.g., mid-career earnings, salary in last job) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bonnet et al. 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Even and Macpherson 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Levine et al. 1999)</ref> or occupational segregation <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Levine et al. 1999)</ref>. However, the relation between earnings with GPGs or women's pensions has not been studied yet in Germany. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Cordova et al. (2022)</ref> find evidence that parts of the gender pension wealth gap in Germany are due to high levels of gender segregation on industries and company size. Furthermore, for Germany specifically, a large share of the GPG is reduced due to the sum of years women were part-time employed <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Frommert and Strauß 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Cordova et al. 2022)</ref>.</p><p>Studies on the gender gap in occupational and personal pensions are rare except in the UK. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bardasi and Jenkins (2010)</ref> found that only a small part of the GPG in private pensions is due to gender differences in time spent in various employment categories and that the gap is mainly due to differences in returns for these characteristics. They conclude that the gender gap in private pension might be predominantly driven by further employment characteristics they could not include, most importantly earnings. However, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Ezeyi and Vujic (2017)</ref> find that the wage in the last job before retirement plays only a role for gender differences in access to private pensions, but not for private pension income. For Germany, higher gender gaps in private compared to public pensions are reported <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Frommert 2020</ref>) and the gender differences in coverage and contributions in private pensions are moderated by career length, hours worked and partly due to the lower income of women (OECD 2021).</p><p>Studies not decomposing the GPG but analysing determinants of women's pensions or gender inequality in pension income highlight the role of family lives. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Fasang et al. (2013)</ref> found a negative impact of the duration of being married on West German and British women's retirement income even when controlling for the employment history. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Kreyenfeld et al. (2023)</ref> highlight the impact of splitting pension rights resulting in divorce being a 'gender equaliser' for public pension inequality in West Germany. <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Mika and Czaplicki (2017)</ref> find a more modest motherhood penalty when considering childcare benefits for West Germany, suggesting how the childcare benefits compensate for maternal employment interruptions in the public pension system. <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Madero-Cabib and Fasang (2016)</ref> were the first to introduce a holistic life course perspective to the field of studies on men's and women's pension income. In their analysis of West Germany and Switzerland, they apply Multichannel Sequence Analysis to categorise typical work-family life courses and reveal the highest pension penalties for typical female workfamily life courses compared to the male standard life course of stable married parenthood and full-time employment. Typical female work-family life courses are characterised by leaving the labour force upon family formation and either engaging in unpaid care work until old age or returning to the labour force part-time. Considering only employment trajectories, Möhring and Weiland (2022) take a couple's perspective and show the highest pension incomes of women in dual-earner and the lowest in male-breadwinner couples.</p><p>However, these life-course-sensitive studies could not differentiate between which part of the gap is due to compositional life course differences between men and women and which part is due to differences in returns. To address the limitations of the standard decomposition approach as well as of previous Sequence Analysis applications, <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Rowold et al. (2024)</ref> suggest combining Sequence Analysis with the Kitagawa-Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition. They find that the gender gaps in total pension income in West Germany and Italy are driven by parents and the interdependences of work and family occurring only in female life courses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Gender, life courses and the pension system</head><p>Theoretical and empirical literature suggests that pension systems reward life courses <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Ginn et al. 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Madero-Cabib and Fasang 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Rowold et al. 2024)</ref>. The life-course paradigm highlights how the development of individuals over the life course depends on the individual opportunities and constraints that are shaped by the socio-historic context, the interdependences with other individuals (linked lives) as well as the timing of events along an individual's life courses <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Elder et al. 2003)</ref>. Consequently, it is important to consider different socio-historic developments as their cultural and institutional legacies are likely to leave their marks on individuals' life opportunities. Both, welfare states and cultural context are relevant for structuring individuals' everyday lives, pushing or discouraging certain gender arrangements and thus shaping gendered life courses (Pfau-Effinger 1998; <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Rosenfeld et al. 2004</ref>).</p><p>The normative influence unfolds especially through the gendered division of labour. The most traditional form assigns men the status of the sole bread-winner and women the role of homemaker and caretaker <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Rosenfeld et al. 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Meyer and Pfau-Effinger 2006)</ref>. Institutions impact gendered work-family life courses particularly through family policies as these determine the opportunities for parents to reconcile care with employment responsibilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Adema 2012</ref>).</p><p>Women's employment life courses are strongly correlated with their family life courses (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Allmendinger et al. 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Muller et al. 2020)</ref>. Specifically, childbirth and having children impact women's employment behaviour and multiple outcomes (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Gangl and Ziefle 2009)</ref>.</p><p>The implications of such dynamics become visible in various gender inequalities in the working sphere such as the overall labour market participation and working hours, gender-specific occupational segregation as well as the gender wage gap (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Gangl and Ziefle 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Budig et al. 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Kunze 2018)</ref>. Based on the concept of cumulative advantage or disadvantage (CAD) <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Dannefer 2003</ref>), these differences between men and women are likely to accumulate over the life course exceeding retirement age <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(O'Rand 1996)</ref>.</p><p>Given all these considerations, including the role of family lives in addition to employment biographies for the understanding of gender inequalities in pensions is particularly relevant <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Allmendinger et al. 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Ginn et al. 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Meyer and Pfau-Effinger 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Frericks 2020)</ref>.</p><p>However, gendered life courses and outcomes alone do not necessarily lead to gender inequalities in pension income. GPGs can only emerge if pension institutions reward the gendered life courses differently <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Rowold et al. 2024)</ref>. Given that pension systems are often structured "based on the norm of continuous full-time employment" <ref type="bibr">(Leitner 2001, p. 103)</ref>, they often do not sufficiently take into account the unequal life-course outcomes of men and women (e.g. Grady 2015).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">The German context</head><p>The life course of the cohorts studied (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">A1</ref>) is affected by welfare policies (mostly family policies) and norms in place from 1939 to 2016 (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). For the majority of this period, Germany was divided and distinct gender ideologies were implemented in both former states <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Rosenfeld et al. 2004)</ref>. Given that the West German welfare state was long seen "as a prototype of a conservative welfare regime" <ref type="bibr">(Kreyenfeld 2010, p. 354)</ref>, providing the perfect setting for a context with high gender inequalities in life courses, this study focusses on West Germany. Important characteristics were (and are partly in place today) long maternal leaves, a late publicly regulated and underdeveloped childcare infrastructure with reduced opening hours as well as a joint taxation system. Together, this encouraged women to work part-time if at all <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Rosenfeld et al. 2004</ref>).</p><p>In summary, the institutional and normative context led to the realisation of the male breadwinner/female homemaker or female part-time model, thus establishing a traditionally gendered division of labour <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Pfau-Effinger 1998)</ref>. For example, the maternal employment rates were below 40% in West Germany for the cohorts born between 1930 and 1960 <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Trappe et al. 2015)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The German pension system and gender</head><p>For the analysis of gender inequalities in pensions, i) access to pension claims and ii) the amount of pensions are important <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Ginn et al. 2001)</ref>. Regarding access to pension claims, eligibility rules and the consideration of time spent for unpaid care work are relevant <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Ginn et al. 2001)</ref>. In Germany, the minimum length of contribution is 5 years, which enables access for individuals with long employment interruptions. Only 7% of West German women (1% of men) do not receive any independent pension income (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">A1</ref>). 1 Individuals' contributions are recorded as earning points (EP) in the German pay-as-you-go public pension system. 1 EP equals the average income of all insured individuals each year while lower values represent below-average incomes and vice versa. The sum of all EPs determines the retiree's public pension income. Self-employees are usually not covered by the public pension system. Civil servants are insured in a separate, very generous system. The public pension system is thus characterized by a strong link between stable employment outcomes and pension income which is disadvantageous for women's pension income in contexts with high gender inequalities.</p><p>However, pension systems often include redistributive tendencies aiming to offset gender inequalities and thus being particularly important for women's pension income <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Leitner 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Horstmann et al. 2009</ref>). This includes benefits for care work and the treatment of part-time work.</p><p>In the German pension system, EPs can be topped up for low-income periods and employment interruptions. For children born before 1992, as is the case for 99.4% of childbirths in the analysis sample, earnings points for one year equivalent to an average employment income per 1 The discussion of the German pension system refers to the pension policies in place from 2006-2015 (which is when pension income was surveyed, see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). child are credited until 2014 (childcare benefit). Low earning points acquired by the studied sample are topped up until a maximum equivalent of 75% of the average income if the individuals reach a minimum contribution length of 35 years benefitting particularly part-time employed mothers <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Czepek 2020)</ref>. Overall, the redistribution in the public pension system works slightly in favour of women as the positive gender gap in the replacement rate suggests (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">A1</ref>).</p><p>Lastly, occupational and personal pensions are argued to be particularly disadvantageous for women due to their positions in the labour market (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Ginn 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr">Möhring 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Occupational pensions refer to pension schemes on the firm level sponsored by the employer and personal pensions to personal saving plans <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Ebbinghaus 2011)</ref>. In this study, I refer to private pensions as the sum of both, occupational and personal pensions.</p><p>Women have lower access to occupations that guarantee generous occupational pension schemes, as these are typical in male-dominated jobs and in larger companies, in which women are underrepresented <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Ginn and Arber 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Ginn 2004</ref>). Reduced working hours, lower occupational status, shorter tenure and lacking financial resources for the high contributions needed are further obstacles to private pension plans <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Ginn 2004</ref>). Additionally, private pensions are overall highly linked to stable employment and lifetime earnings <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Ginn and Arber 1996)</ref>, have in contrast to most public pillars almost no redistributive elements and are therefore likely to reinforce (gender) inequalities that emerged in the labour market <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Möhring 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Occupational and personal pensions are not mandatory in Germany, but the overall coverage increased in the past decades <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Ebbinghaus et al. 2011)</ref>. Occupational pensions differ largely by industry and company size which leads to inequalities between men and women due to genderspecific occupational segregation (Schmitz-Kießler 2020). 39.9% of men but only 21.7% of women in my sample have an occupational pension (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">A1</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Expectations</head><p>The set of guiding expectations is contingent upon the assumption that the initial step of the analysis will yield work-family life course patterns broadly consistent with previous research <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Madero-Cabib and Fasang 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Rowold et al. 2024)</ref>. I expect a share of the GPG to be due to more women having work-family life courses characterised by care work, employment interruptions and part-time employment parallel to parenthood (expectation 1), as such activities are not well rewarded by both pension types. Conversely, fathers are shown to be more likely to realize stable careers without employment interruptions in the German context.</p><p>Stable employment leads to high public and private pensions. Consequently, I expect that a share of the GPG is attributable to life courses characterized by stable careers occurring more often for men (expectation 2.1). Furthermore, beyond the mere categorisation of employment types as in previous research, I expect that parts of the GPG are due to the lack of women in stable high-income careers (expectation 2.2).</p><p>Given the stronger link to former labour market characteristics in private pensions (see previous section), I assume a higher reproduction of labour market inequalities in private compared to public pensions. I expect that gender gaps in private pensions will be more associated with gender differences in life courses characterised by unstable working or part-time careers and labour market dropouts (expectation 3.1). In particular, I assume that the influence of income inequality over the working career will be more strongly reproduced in private pensions.</p><p>Consequently, gendered life courses characterised by high-or low-income jobs are likely to be more strongly associated with the gap in private pensions (expectation 3.2).</p><p>In the context of public pension income, the reproduction of life-course inequalities should be partly buffered by the (gender-specific) redistribution tendencies implemented in the public pension system. I expect the gender gap in public pension income to be reduced by higher rewards for mothers compared to fathers in life courses with high shares of care-related employment interruptions and part-time employment (expectation 4.1). Specifically, I expect that this phenomenon will occur due to better rewards for the life courses of divorced women compared to divorced men, irrespective of the working life course (expectation 4.2).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Explained part.</head><p>Overall, I find that the high level of gender segregation on the life-course patterns 1, 2, 3, 5 and 6 (visible in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>) is related to the gender gap in both, public and private pension income.</p><p>The association of life courses with the GPG in the sense of the explained part of the decomposition is not solely a result of the high level of gender segregation, but also of the gender-biased evaluation through the pension system: men-typical life courses are rewarded with more pension income than women-majority ones (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">A7</ref>). 8 In total, the high level of gender segregation on typical life courses explains 40% of the gender gap in public pensions, but only 13% of the gap in private pensions.</p><p>On one hand, the overrepresentation of women in the two care-dominated and poorly rewarded clusters is among the main reasons for the high GPGs in both pension types (expectation 1 confirmed). For example, West German women would receive an average of 1,396 Euros more public pensions if as few women as men had engaged in continuous unpaid care work (12.9% of the GPG). Another 804 Euros (7.5%) of the gender gap in public pensions are due to the German part-time legacy encouraging mothers to combine unpaid care duties with paid parttime employment. The relative shares of the gaps explained by these two women-majority lifecourse patterns are slightly higher for public compared to private pensions. This highlights the poor recognition of care work in the German public pension system and goes against the assumption that life courses dominated by labour-market dropouts and part-time employment are particularly penalized in private pensions (expectation 3.1 rejected).</p><p>On the other hand, the lack of mothers in stable careers independent of employment type plays a dominant role for women's lower pension income compared to men (expectation 2.1 confirmed). However, the association depends strongly on the career type and earnings level.</p><p>For the dominance of fathers in high-income and low-income full-time employment careers in the private sector I find contrary relationships with the GPG. While the lack of mothers in highincome careers drives the GPG (expectation 2.2 confirmed), the gap would be even higher if as many mothers as fathers experienced full-time, but low-wage careers (2% for public and 9%</p><p>for private pensions). This highlights the relevance of earnings beyond full-time employment for gendered pension inequality. Additionally, as expected, the associations differ largely 8 Except for cluster 4 for both pension income types and cluster 3 for private pensions.</p><p>between pension pillars. The absence of mothers in the high-earnings (1) and the low-earnings cluster ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>) is much stronger associated with the gap in private compared to public pensions (expectation 3.2 confirmed). 4% of the gap in public compared to 22% of the gap in private pensions is due to more men being able to combine parenthood of two or more children with stable careers in high-income jobs in the private sector. While this is the main reason for the gender gap in private pensions, most of the gap in public pensions is due to the much higher prevalence of men having stable civil servant careers that are highly rewarded in the public pension system (cluster 3, 20% of the gap). Reversely, the lack of civil servant careers for women cushions the gap in private pensions (-17% of the gap). This is most likely because the high public pension income for civil servants disincentivises them to invest additionally in voluntary pension schemes (see different returns by pension type for cluster 3, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">A7</ref>).  Returns component. I do not find that the gender-sensitive redistribution implemented in the German public pension system reduces the GPG. Even in clusters with high shares of unpaid care mothers do not benefit from higher pension income compared to fathers (expectation 4.1 rejected). This underlines the insufficiency of the pension system to prevent the reproduction of gender inequalities arising over the life course in old age. As an exception, I find evidence of women profiting from the splitting of couples' pension claims upon divorce (in line with <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Kreyenfeld et al. 2023</ref>). Women's better pension returns compared to men's in life courses with longer divorce spells reduce the gender gap in public pensions by two percentage points (expectation 4.2 confirmed). More generally, I find that a higher share of the gender gap in private compared to public pension is due to differences in returns for the same life-course patterns (especially for clusters 7 and 8). Given the high volatility in the working life courses of clusters 7 and 8, the genderspecific heterogeneity in characteristics such as earnings, part-time employment, and care work in these life courses most likely (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">A6</ref>) drives the result. Private pensions thus reproduce such gender inequalities within life-course patterns through more gender-unequal pension returns than public pensions (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">A7</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sensitivity analysis</head><p>The main results are robust for controlling for survey waves, nativity, and educational level and using different reference coefficients or weights in the KOB (see Appendix 7A6). Using the original cluster solution instead of slightly equalizing the gendered distribution on the clusters to make the decomposition more robust, as well as excluding poorly assigned individuals from the clusters, the magnitude of the explained shares tends to become slightly larger (in line with <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Rowold et al. 2024</ref>).</p><p>In the Appendix (xxxxxxxx) I further present analyses to address two major conceptual choices of the main models. First, the main model decomposes the GPG on the mean, though the relationship between life course patterns and the Gender Pension Gap is likely to differ along the distribution. Second, I include additional analyses to assess the sensitivity of the conceptual decision to include zero pensions as well as to analyse the Gender Coverage Gap, i.e., the gender differences in public and private pension receipt. However, both extentiional analyses have to be read with caution due to the low number of observations and have to be proved robust with larger samples.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Discussion</head><p>This study applied an innovative two-step approach and rich linked survey-register data to assess how work-family life-course patterns relate to the gender gap in public and private pensions in West Germany. I contribute to the recent literature on the GPG, decomposing the GPG while considering holistic life courses that include annual relative earnings, and differentiating between mechanisms shaping the gender gap in public and private pensions. The research design enables discussing the implications of pension privatisation on gender pension disparities, concerning work-family interdependences. The first step of the analysis reveals high levels of gender segregation on work-family life courses. The segregation on the differently well-rewarded life-course patterns makes up for 40% of the gender gap in public and 13% of the gap in private pensions. The SA-KOB decomposition shows that only life courses of parents with two or more children drive the gender gap in pension income since only these life courses are highly gendered. Four main findings stand out.</p><p>First, 20% of the gap in public pensions alone is due to almost exclusively female life courses in which mothers drop out of the labour force for the rest of their lives after childbirth or a shorter period before reconciling care work with part-time employment (similar associations for private pensions). Previous studies highlighted the lack of women's full-time employment as the main reason for the GPG in Germany <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Frommert and Strauß 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Hänisch and Klos 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Cordova et al. 2022)</ref>. Considering unpaid care work linked to parenthood from a holistic life-course perspective on top of formal employment shifts the focus to the relevance of dividing labour between genders for the GPG. Given the empirical evidence suggesting that childbirth drives gender inequalities along the pre-retirement life course <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Gangl and Ziefle 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Aisenbrey et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Budig et al. 2016)</ref>, the results confirm this inequality to be reproduced in old age by the German pension system.</p><p>Additional analyses show that equalising the division of unpaid care work is particularly important to mitigate the gender disparities in public pensions at the bottom of the distribution, where the GPG is most pronounced and the poverty risk is highest. The compositional gender difference in engaging continuously in care work is also the main reason for the gender gap in private pension coverage, while the female-typical part-time life course type tends to mostly play a role for gender differences in private pension incomes among private pension recipients.</p><p>Second, gender inequalities in earnings, once women are active in the labour force, are relevant for the GPG as well. This complements previous research on West Germany highlighting the role of (full-time) employment for the GPG without considering earning positions (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Frommert and Strauß 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Fasang et al. 2013</ref>). If mothers have access to full-time employment, they hold lower-income jobs which lead to lower pension income. While the lack of mothers with high-income careers drives the GPG, the gap would be even larger if the share of mothers with unstable low-medium income careers were as high as that of fathers (particularly for private pensions). Thus, only access to high-income employment ensures mothers' financial independence in old age. Even though previous data has suggested the opposite <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Fasang et al. 2013)</ref>, full-time employment itself is most likely not sufficient, at least in comparison to men's pension income. Low-income employment improves, however, mothers' public pension income at the lower end of the pension distribution as additional analyses show. But to increase women's pensions compared to men's along the whole distribution, mothers need access to better-rewarded employment life courses.</p><p>Third, these earnings-related associations are much stronger pronounced for the gender gap in private pensions, confirming the stronger reproduction of earning inequalities in the second and third pension pillars even compared to the heavily earnings-related public pension system in Germany. The association of mothers' absence in high-income careers with the gender gap is five times higher in private compared to public pensions. This finding confirms the assumption of <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bardasi &amp; Jenkins (2010)</ref> that for private pensions the driving forces for the high gender inequalities in access and entitlements are characteristics beyond labour market participation.</p><p>The most straightforward reason is that stable high-income careers are much more likely to accumulate financial resources that could be invested in private pensions compared to caredominated or low-income life courses, whereas public pensions rely less on monetary investments and include redistribution elements. Indeed, the gender difference in high-income compared to low-income careers of parents attributes to more than twice of the gender difference in access to private pensions. However, equalising the access of mothers to lowincome careers would still help close the Gender Coverage Gap. At the same time, it would increase the gender gap in private pension benefits among recipients since low-income careers are detrimental to the entitlement with private pensions.</p><p>Fourth, even when considering public pensions only, I do not find that the average GPG is reduced by better rewards of mothers compared to fathers with the same life-course pattern due to gender-sensitive adjustments in the pension rewarding structure. The unexplained shares suggest that the only efficient pension policy tool for reducing gender inequality in pension income is the splitting of pension claims after divorce (confirming <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Kreyenfeld et al. 2023)</ref>.</p><p>However, at the bottom of the distribution, women benefit from better pension returns compared to men for the two women-majority life course patterns characterized by continuous care work or part-time employment. Redistributive elements such as childcare benefits and topping-up low EPs thus lead to female public pension advantages which mitigate the compositional disadvantages of women for these life courses and thus the Gender Pension Gap among individuals with low pensions. Still, they cannot make up for the pension loss of women with female-typical life courses due to the lack of careers in private employment or civil service the GPG is highest at the bottom of the distribution.</p><p>This study is subject to several limitations due to data constraints. First, given that the results highlight the relevance of more detailed labour characteristics over the life course (i.e., earnings) other pronounced gendered labour market inequalities might also contribute to the GPG. For example, future research should assess the impact of gender segregation on occupations or firm size, especially amidst the privatisation of pensions given that both are related to gendered private pension income in the UK <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Gardiner et al. 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Ezeyi and Vujic 2017)</ref> and a smaller share of the gender gap in private pension is explainable by the available data in this study. Second, some of the results are subject to a very low number of observations in the linked-survey-admin data. This leads to limited statistical power and robustness, especially for small clusters (e.g., cluster 10 characterised by divorce) and for the extension analyses along the distribution and among pension recipients only. Hence, future research might want to replicate the analysis for contexts providing richer data (e.g., more recent cohorts or countries with higher private pension coverage). This article could also be extended by <ref type="bibr">(i.)</ref> applying the design to countries with different pension systems (e.g., Netherlands, UK, Denmark, or Sweden), (ii.) including cohort and period comparisons for better understanding the trend of the GPG, and (iii) simulating pension income for future cohorts in old age.</p><p>The results of this study highlight the relevance of the traditional gender division of labour for the reproduction of gender inequalities in old age. Specifically, the GPG is largely the result of German policies that first incentivise a traditional division of labour and then, in terms of pension income, poorly reward life courses that fulfil the high demands of unpaid care work. This stresses how the pension system in later life interacts with the welfare regimes at early life stages in shaping the high level of GPGs. By ignoring this inter-temporal link between welfare policies, the current pension system particularly penalises women who have acted in accordance with gender norms and welfare state contexts and devoted most of their lives to caring for others. In old age, these women must rely on the redistribution in the pension system to achieve financial independence. However, my results confirm previous studies highlighting the inability of public pensions to buffer the reproduction of gender inequalities over the life course in old age (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Horstmann et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Frommert and Strauß 2013)</ref>. The childcare benefits equivalent to one or two years of employment are nothing else than a mirage for these women who have provided on average 37 years of unpaid care work until age 65. The only equalizing influence of pension policies is confirmed for the intra-couple pension claim splitting after divorce, which makes it the most attractive policy tool for equalizing pension rewards for gender-typical lifecourse patterns. Such ex-ante policies are important to ensure independent pension income for women whose life courses were shaped in conservative contexts incentivising a traditional division of labour between men and women.</p><p>However, for future cohorts, a more sustainable approach to prevent high GPGs is to implement welfare policies aiming to equalize the gendered division of labour and gender inequalities in the labour market. Firstly, facilitating an equal division of unpaid and paid work between men and women is important to ensure access to the labour market for women, especially mothers. However, particularly in the light of the privatisation of pensions and the constant level of the gender pay gap in Germany, the results of this study suggest that this will not be sufficient to equalise pension incomes between genders, given the high reproduction of earnings inequalities in private pensions. Gender inequalities in the labour market, such as the gender pay gap, but possibly also occupational segregation, are likely to be reproduced more strongly for future retirement cohorts. Thus, secondly, for women's pension income, it is of high importance to combat inequalities in the labour market once women are employed.</p><p>The potential for the increasing labour market participation of women in Germany to result in a reduction in gendered pension income inequality in the future will be largely contingent upon the success of the German welfare state in addressing significant gender-based disparities in the labour market, as well as the manner in which low-income and part-time employment, in addition to unpaid care work, will be compensated within the pension system.     <ref type="bibr">.54 52.38 41.67 31.63 44.44 46.84 31.82 33.64 37.21 29.41 29.63 62.50 21.43 26.32 1939-1944 46.61 0.00 32.37 30.77 40.30 36.36 24.39 23.81 33.33 38.27 33.33 37.34 36.36 27.10 44.19 38.24 40.74 37.50 35.71 42.11 1945-1950 24.58 100.00 20.14 30.77 24.63 57.58 17.07 23.81 25.00 30.10 22.22 15.82 31.82 39.25 18.60 32.35</ref>   </p></div>

This is even more the case for the analyses with a focus on gender, as is the case here.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The procedure for civil servants and self-employees</head><p>Since self-employees and civil servants are not covered in the administrative records, the information on them is solely based on the survey data. I impute both working states in two different ways.</p><p>First, there are individuals not covered at all in the administrative records who have reported for most of their working lives (defined by more than 19 years) to be selfemployed or civil servants. These individuals are most likely not included as these employment types are not covered in the administrative records or because they did not agree to link the survey data with the administrative records. I include individuals in the analysis sample who have reported to have worked for at least 19 years as civil servants or self-employed respectively in the SHARE data. The working states of these individuals are thus fully based on the survey data. The 'civil servants' that I include and who are originally not covered in the administrative data, report civil service for 76.8-80.4% of their personyear spells (Figure <ref type="figure">A8</ref>). Self-employees, that I include and who are originally not covered in the administrative data, report to be self-employed for 73.3-74.6% of their person-year spells (Figure <ref type="figure">A9</ref>). As information on the earning points for the reported years of any (fulltime) employment in the private sector is unavailable for these individuals, I code the employment years they have reported as part-time employment (up to 16% of all personyear spells for those individuals). </p></div>

Not weighted.</p><p>Secondly, even if individuals are matched with the administrative records, I mostly lack information on whether these individuals were self-employed or civil servants. In most cases, such periods are coded as 'non-contributory periods'. As described above, I replaced all 'non-contributory periods' with civil service or self-employment if these were reported in the survey data. Furthermore, I overwrite administrative records for person-year spells that responded reported to be civil servants or self-employees if the records recorded another working state for less than 12 months for the specific year.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A4 Multichannel Sequence Analysis: analytical choices and robustness</head><p>Sequence Analysis is an exploratory approach. Still, its analytical choices should be guided by theoretical and, where appropriate, statistical measures <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Aisenbrey and Fasang 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Raab and Struffolino 2022)</ref>.</p><p>For Multichannel Sequence Analyses, that is when several life course domains are considered in the Sequence Analysis jointly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Piccarreta (2017)</ref> suggest first considering the correlation between the domains of interest. The idea is that the domains have to be interrelated to some extent to justify a joint MSA over them. Using the Mantel coefficient, I observe an overall weak but statistically significant positive relationship among the domains (.03). Since I theoretically assume that the linkage between the working and family spheres differs largely between genders and that women's working lives are stronger linked to their family life, I conduct the analysis by gender (as suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Raab &amp; Struffolino (2022)</ref>. As assumed, I find that the linear correspondence of family dissimilarities to working dissimilarities is indeed much more positively associated for women (.165) compared to men (insignificant and slightly negative).</p><p>In such cases, <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Raab &amp; Struffolino (2022)</ref> suggest considering separate MSAs by subgroups, here gender, to prevent concealing gender-specific joint life-course patterns. However, in combination with the KOB decomposition, I need the same covariates, i.e. cluster, per group to decompose the outcome of interest based on the second step (see Chapter 3).</p><p>Additionally, as in most applications of the SA-KOB decomposition, I assume that lifecourse patterns differ by the group of interests, and this might be specifically also the case for the linkage between domains. Thus, when combining MSA with the KOB, one must still go for a joint Sequence Analysis, even if the linkage between domains is driven by only one of the groups.</p><p>To take advantage of the exploratory nature of SA, I assess different parameters along the analytical choices. First, I apply different versions of optimal matching (OM) to calculate the distance matrix for individual sequences which is used in the next step, the cluster analysis. I apply two different types of data-driven substitution costs, based on transition rates as well as a common future (holding the indel costs constant at max(sm)/2). I then use substitution costs based on transition rates for Hamming distances as well as Dynamic Hamming Distances (DHD), which are more time-sensitive approaches. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_6">10</ref>As second parameter I use the two most applied clustering approaches in the field, hierarchical clustering based on Ward's Linkage, as well as Partitioning Around Medoids (PAM). Lastly, for the hierarchical clustering outcomes, I guide my choice of the number of clusters retrieved based on standard Cluster Quality Indices (CQI) such as the Average Silhouette Width (ASW), the pseudo R2 as well as Hubert's Gamma (HG). I further disregard solutions suggesting less than 6 or more than 12 clusters for empirical and theoretical reasons.</p><p>This leaves me with a total of 18 cluster solutions which I visually examine to assess the analytical and theoretical fit with the research question and assumptions.</p><p>The best-performing solution (ASW of .282) is a cluster outcome with 11 clusters based on OM with substitution cost calculated based on a common future and clustered by Ward.</p><p>However, the only remarkable difference to the cluster solution using the same parameters but deriving 10 life-course patterns only, is that the 11-cluster solution reveals two instead of one cluster dominated by stable careers in civil service. One of the clusters is characterized by being married and having at least 2 children over the life course, while the individuals in the other cluster have different family life courses, most dominantly being married and having one child. This does not seem to provide added theoretical value important enough to justify the disadvantages with regard to the number of observations per group that each additional cluster brings. The 10-cluster solution contains only lifecourse patterns that are theoretically highly relevant while still achieving the third-highest ASW among all cluster solutions examined in more detail.</p><p>All cluster solutions considered that were clustered by PAM do not include a family life course that is dominated by divorce periods. This is, however, highly relevant concerning the German pension system, since pension claims are split after divorce and therefore pension claims up to the divorce are equalized.</p><p>Apart from that, the chosen cluster solution is robust against the cost specification applied. I find very similar clusters when using costs based on transition rates, as well as Dynamic Hamming Distances or normal hamming distances (correlation between different cluster solutions .92-93).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A5</head><p>Reassigning single trajectories to address the common support problem.</p><p>To improve the robustness of the decomposition, I systematically select and assign single trajectories to the low-n clusters for each group as previously suggested <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Rowold et al. 2024)</ref>. I do the reassignment based on three options.</p><p>For the first option, I consider the other four well-performing cluster solutions suggesting 10 clusters (see description in S2). I re-group individual trajectories if they were assigned to one of the low-n clusters in one of the alternative cluster solutions. The low-n clusters for men and women are the high-income cluster (1) for women, the part-time and noncontributory cluster ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>) and care work cluster <ref type="bibr">(6)</ref> for men. I do not re-group trajectories from other small clusters (most importantly clusters 9 and 10) to not create more common support issues.</p><p>For the reassignment of male trajectories, this first procedure succeeds in reassigning a few male trajectories to clusters 5 and 6. All reassigned trajectories indeed have a rather poor fit with the life-course patterns they were previously grouped with in the main cluster solution (measured by silhouette values, not shown), which validates this procedure.</p><p>However, no other cluster solution has assigned additional women to the high-income cluster.</p><p>As second option, I combine information on how coherent the individual trajectories are with the overall cluster (silhouette value distribution, using the 10 th percentile as the cutoff for identifying poorly assigned individuals) with the sum of years individuals have spent in the life-course states that are important characteristics for the cluster. For men, I only do this for cluster 5 since I already have n=25 men in the care cluster <ref type="bibr">(6)</ref>.</p><p>For women, this option does not identify additional women for the high-income cluster. Furthermore, women benefit from higher public and private pension returns for a low educational level compared to men. For public pension, this might be due to upgrades of female caretakers' pension income. On the other hand, however, parts of the GPGs are due to higher pension returns for men with tertiary education compared to their female peers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>b) Using different reference coefficients</head><p>Using different reference coefficients (male, female, or pooled for all covariates) the magnitude of the explained parts changes only slightly, and particularly the results using the reference coefficients from a pooled model are very similar to the main results (similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Rowold et al. 2024)</ref>. For public pension, the returns shares are not sensitive to the reference coefficient chosen but for private pension the negative returns share for cluster 2 becomes significant, suggesting that mothers with low-income employment receive better pension rewards than fathers with similar life courses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>c) Using the original MSA solution</head><p>As expected and in line with <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Rowold et al. (2024)</ref>, the explained shares are larger when using the original, more unequal gendered distribution on clusters. This is particularly the case for the life courses of parents characterized by high-income jobs, part-time employment, and care work (clusters 1, 4, and 5) for private pensions. The explained shares in the main analyses are thus slightly underestimated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>d) Impact of the heterogeneity within the same life-course cluster.</head><p>Lastly, I exclude poorly assigned individuals from the clusters to make the life courses within clusters more coherent. First, this tests whether the results are robust to heterogeneities of trajectories within the clusters. Second, it indicates whether the withincluster heterogeneity is gender-specific which might drive the unexplained shares of the KOB <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Rowold et al. 2024)</ref>. If the trajectories between men and women in the same cluster systematically differ (i.e., the trajectories of one gender fit better to the cluster), this might be the reason for differences in returns. As an indicator for poor assignment to the clusters, I use the Average Silhouette Width (ASW) which provides a measure for each trajectory on how well it fits the overall cluster characteristics <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Kaufman and Rousseeuw 1990)</ref>. I follow previous suggestions and use cluster-specific relative cutoffs of the ASW (5 th and 10 th percentile of the cluster-specific ASW distribution) to exclude individuals with a lower ASW from the cluster (for more details, see Rowold et al. 2024). 11   The results suggest that the unexplained parts, i.e., the gender differences in returns for the same life-course clusters, were not driven by gender-specific within-cluster heterogeneity (results available upon request). As previously shown <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Rowold et al. 2024</ref>) effect sizes of explained shares tend to be slightly larger.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analytical extension I: decomposition along the distribution</head><p>The literature on the Gender Pension Gap so far mostly focuses on inequalities at the mean. percentiles to mitigate this issue. Still, the results must be interpreted with caution as the limited number of observations restricts the robustness, particularly for smaller clusters. I apply the RIF (recentered influence function) decomposition which reveals the explained and returns shares, similarly to the KOB, for each characteristic separately <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Firpo et al. 2018)</ref>. However, given that the available implementations of the RIF decomposition do not allow specifying the reference coefficient as flexible as the KOB 12 , I present the results using the male coefficients as reference for all variables. Given the large share of no private pension income, I only decompose the GPG in public pension along the distribution.</p><p>The absolute gap between men's and women's pension income increases from just below €10,000 at the lowest quarter of pension income, to above €12,000 at the 75 th percentile (see Figure <ref type="figure">A</ref>). Conversely, the relative GPG decreases from just below 80% at the 25 th percentile to about 55% at the 75 th percentile. 13 This corresponds to the notion of 'sticky floors' mostly applied to the phenomena of the gender wage gap being the largest at the bottom of the distribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Arulampalam et al. 2007</ref>). The trend is similar for total pension income <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Hänisch and Klos 2014)</ref>. This also highlights the need to disentangle the driver of the gap at the bottom of the distribution since women with the lowest pensions not only face the largest inequalities but are also most likely to face old-age poverty <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bonnet et al. 2020</ref>).</p><p>12 This is at least the case for the oaxaca_rif command (Rios-Avila 2020) used in stata. 13 Similar patterns are documented for deciles <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Rowold 2023)</ref>. Decomposing these varying gaps across the distribution reveals that some associations vary strongly along the distribution (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">A2</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">A3</ref>). For the explained shares, the decomposition at the mean revealed that the gap is reduced because more fathers compared to mothers have stable but low-income careers (cluster 2). However, this relationship is driven by the top half of the distribution. For the bottom of the distribution (1 st quartile, i.e., the quarter with the lowest pensions), the association is reversed: about 5% of the gap is due to the lack of mothers with low-income careers. At the median, the 50 th percentile, the relationship is already negative. This highlights that any full-time employment in the private sector, even if in low-income jobs, is important to increase women's compared to men's public pensionbut only at the lower end of the pension distribution. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_7">14</ref> The association of the GPG with cluster 1 (parenthood combined with high-income careers) peaks at the bottom of the distribution and decreases along the distribution. For the life courses with careers in the private sector (clusters 1 and 2), my results align with the pattern identified for total pension income and employment years previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Hänisch and Klos 2014)</ref>. However, my results confirm this pattern for both, high and low-income careers. The association of civil servant careers with the GPG peaks for the highest quartile: the lack of mothers with stable civil servant careers makes up for about one-fourth of the gap at the top quarter of the pension distribution alone. Thus, for equalising the gender gap in public pensions at the top of the distribution, equal access of women to civil service careers is by far the most important component.</p><p>The share of the gap that is attributable to the dominance of mothers in life courses characterized by unpaid care work or care-related employment interruptions and part-time employment is most pronounced at the lower end of the pension distribution and decreases along the distribution. While it remains significant for life courses of mothers who were consistently engaged in care work (cluster 6), it becomes insignificant for mothers who balance their caregiving responsibilities with part-time employment (cluster 5) from the median pension level onward. Simultaneously, however, the relationship between the returns component and the GPG along the distribution shows a reverse pattern (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">A3</ref>). At the bottom of the distribution mothers with part-time careers fare better than fathers in the same life course pattern, which more than compensates for the portion of the gap attributed to the much higher representation of mothers in this life course pattern (explained component). However, at the upper end of the distribution, the returns component turns positive. Consequently, women in cluster 5 and at the top of the pension distribution are worse off compared to men with similar life courses due to worse pension rewards, despite the reduced compositional component.</p><p>Considering both the compositional and the returns components jointly the results imply that mothers with part-time careers are only at a pension disadvantage compared to men at the top of the income distribution. Elements implemented in the pension system for women with such life courses (e.g., childcare benefits and upgrading of part-time employment reflected in the returns component) apparently help to equalize the overall disadvantage experienced by women at the lower end of the income distribution due to more mothers reconciling their parenthood with part-time employment compared to men (explained part).</p><p>A similar pattern is evident for mothers consistently engaged in unpaid care work, albeit to a lesser extent. The pension penalty of mothers doing unpaid care work is mitigated due to better returns compared to fathers with similar life courses, but not entirely canceled out.</p><p>However, from the median pension level onward, men receive higher pensions compared to women in cluster 6, thereby reinforcing the part of the GPG associated with cluster 6.</p><p>These are important dynamics that become not evident in the analysis at the mean, partly because they cancel each other out due to opposing associations along the distributions (returns component). In summary, these results suggest that the key for reducing the GPG among individuals with the lowest public pension income is enabling mothers access to any full-time employment. Jointly, 60% of the GPG at the bottom of the distribution are due to the majority of women reconciling their motherhood with continuous unpaid care work, or part-time employment after care-work-related interruptions, instead of having any stable full-time employment or civil service career (clusters 1 <ref type="bibr">-3, 5-6)</ref>. For the center and top parts of the distribution it then becomes more relevant to create access for mothers to particularly well-rewarded employment types such as high-income jobs in the private sector or the civil service to decrease the GPG. This finding is overall in line with results for France <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bonnet et al. 2020</ref>) and links the results of the main analyses to previous evidence in Germany suggesting that the lack of female employment is the main driver of women's low pension income <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Fasang et al. 2013)</ref>.</p><p>Moreover, the results beyond the mean suggest that women with women-majority life courses dominated by unpaid care work do profit from redistribution in the pension systems when it comes to pension income compared to men, but only at the bottom of the distribution. While mothers with part-time careers after care-related employment interruptions do even have small pension advantages compared to fathers with similar life courses due to better pension rewards, the disadvantage of mothers with continuous unpaid care work is not fully buffered through more favourable pension rewards. However, it has to be kept in mind that the reference at the bottom of the distribution is at a very low level with an annual pension of €12,531 (men's pension at the 25 th percentile, not shown), which is only slightly above the threshold for the poverty risk (€11,749 for singles in 2013, Statistisches Bundesamt (Destatis) 2023). In fact, women's pension income is below the poverty risk even at the median and top of the distribution (€6,122 and €10,016, not shown), which highlights the relevance for policymakers to increase women's pension income not only at the bottom of the distribution.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analytical extension I: decomposition of the Gender Coverage Gap</head><p>By including individuals with no pension income with a pension income of zero, the main analysis assesses the gender gap in pension receipt (whether individuals receive any pension income) and the gender gap in pension entitlements (the pension amount individuals receive) jointly. However, previous research shows that determinants of the gender coverage gap and the gender gap in pension entitlements among recipients differ <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Even and Macpherson 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Ezeyi and Vujic 2017)</ref>. Additionally, the conceptual decision to include zero pensions leads to zero-inflated distributions, particularly for private pensions (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">A1</ref>). Almost 96% receive an independent public pension, but only 34% receive their own private pension (not shown). OLS regressions, which are used as baseline models for the KOB, are not best equipped for modelling such zero-inflated distributions.</p><p>There are several ways to deal with zero-inflated distributions.

These work-family life-course patterns are overall in line with previous research (e.g., Madero-Cabib and Fasang 2016; Rowold et al. 2024), but reveal additionally how the earnings in private employment evolve over the life course. As such, the first two clusters contribute to the literature by disclosing two typical earning patterns beyond 'stable' full-time employment parallel to parenthood and marriage.</figDesc><table><row><cell>Cluster 3 includes a stable employment pattern characterized by relatively long educational</cell></row><row><cell>periods followed by continuous civil servant careers. Most individuals are married and have 2</cell></row><row><cell>or more children, but about one quarter have only one child or remain childless (Table</cell></row></table><note><p><p>Cluster 1 uncovers a life course type with stable full-time employment and earnings in the highest quartile or up-ward mobility leading to the highest earnings quartile. Family formation starts in the mid-30s, whereby the age at birth of the first child varies. This life course is dominated by fathers, while almost no mothers in West Germany experience such high-income careers.</p>Cluster 2 reveals a more volatile employment life pattern. Even though most individuals experience nearly continuous full-time employment in the private sector, there are many shifts in the relative earnings over individuals' life course, including both, upward and downward mobility. Family formation and retirement start earlier than in cluster 1. Occasionally, life courses have short unpaid care interruptions in their careers. While a low share of women (4.3%) can combine volatile full-time employment with parenthood, 20.7% of men experience this volatile life course.</p></note></figure>

In parallel with the onset of family formation and frequently at an early age, individuals shift from full-time employment to full-time care. After employment interruptions of 5 to 20 years, the individuals return to labour force in part-time or non-</figDesc><table /><note><p><p><p>contributing or low-income jobs. One-third of all women have this life course, whereas almost no men reconcile parenthood with care and part-time work.</p>Cluster 6 starts with short education or employment trajectories. Like cluster 5, individuals transition to care work parallel to marriage and childbirth, but in this case into lifelong trajectories of care work. This is the second most prevalent life-course pattern among women (26% of all women), but only 2.7% of all men have similar life courses. Clusters 5 and 6 show thus a clear temporal interaction between family and work lives, while men-typical life courses do not show such interactions.</p>Clusters 7-10 have heterogenous working life courses that are mostly dominated by different types of full-time employment but differ by family life. Individuals in Cluster 7 have 1 child, respondents in cluster 8 get married at comparable old ages but have no children. Respondents in cluster 9 are lifelong singles and a higher share of all men experience this life course. Individuals in Cluster 10 experience a divorce and, in most cases, remain divorced afterwards.</p></note></figure>

However, the retrospective survey data provides family and working life courses on annual basis. I thus transform the more fine-grained monthly data of the pension records to annual data, using the mode per year, that is the situation the individuals were most in during the respective year, as has been done before <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Bühler et al. 2022)</ref>.</p><p>Any employees or other groups (such as apprentices, persons raising children, noncommercial caregivers, persons with disabilities, persons in military or voluntary service, persons who receive unemployment or sickness benefits, and students with marginal jobs) who are subject to mandatory public pension insurance are covered in the administrative data. Self-employees (with some exceptions) and civil servants as well as judges, professional militaries, and potentially some other groups of occupations are normally not covered in the public pension system and thus do not appear in the data. However, as soon they had at least one month of an insured activity they are included in the data.</p><p>Such periods of non-insured activity are recorded as a 'non-contributory period' as their social income situation. On top of activities not insured in the public pension scheme, Thus, for women only, I apply option 3, in which I only consider the sum of years in high (4 th quartile) or medium-high (3 rd quartile) earning full-time jobs )as well as the time spent in part-time and care work. I aim to identify women with many years spent in high-earning full-time jobs and few years with care work and part-time employment. Doing this, I identify 6 more women who broadly share the characteristics of life-course pattern 1.</p><p>The absolute gender-specific distribution on the cluster before and after the reassignment is visible in Figure <ref type="figure">A14</ref> and the final relative distribution is given in Figure <ref type="figure">A15</ref>. </p></div>

For both pension income types, parts of the gender gaps that are due to more men in life-course patterns 1-3 (parents with high or low-income careers in the private sectors or civil servants) are being picked up by educational differences between men and women (results available upon request). This is because educational differences are partly inherent in the life-course clusters (e.g., clusters 1 and 3 have a higher share of educational periods after age 18, Figure <ref type="figure">A4</ref>). While the parts of the explained shares for clusters 1 and 3 due to educational differences are only marginal, the negative association of more fathers having stable but low-income employment careers is almost fully absorbed by the educational gradient between men and women.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Private pensions</head><p>The Gender Coverage Gap in private pensions amounts to 44.5%. More than half of this gap is due to gender differences in work-family life courses (see Table <ref type="table">A8,</ref><ref type="table">M3</ref>). The gender gap in private pensions among private pension recipients is smaller in relative terms but larger in absolute terms (58%, €4,422, see Table <ref type="table">A8</ref>, M4) compared to the main model, when considering gender differences in access to and entitlement of private pensions jointly (76.6%, €2,539, see Table <ref type="table">A8</ref>, M2). However, the subsample of private pension recipients is very small and highly selective (291 men and 146 women) which is why the decomposition in M4 must be read with caution. 55% of the Gender Coverage Gap alone is attributable to the much higher share of women with life courses dominated by continuous unpaid care work (cluster 6): 38% of women without any private pension receipt have these life courses, but only 8% of women who receive own private pensions (see Figure <ref type="figure">A1</ref>). For the gender gap in private pensions among private pension recipients, however, continuous care work does not play a significant role (Table <ref type="table">A8,</ref><ref type="table">M4</ref>). Surprisingly, the other female-typical life course pattern characterised by mothers reconciling their care work responsibilities with employment interruptions and part-time employment does not play a role for access to private pensions.</p><p>Gender differences in the realisation of such life courses tend to be mostly responsible for 15 I do not consider the selection into pension receipt in the modelling approach for the second step (see for details Rowold 2023).. Another 38% of the Gender Coverage Gap is due to the lack of mothers with stable highincome careers (cluster 1) and 15% due to fewer mothers with unstable low-income careers (cluster 2, Table <ref type="table">A8,</ref><ref type="table">M3</ref>). Given that the gender differences in clusters 1 and 2 are almost identical, equalising the share of mothers with high-income careers would reduce to Gender Coverage Gap in private pensions to a higher degree (twice as much). However, while the gender differences in stable high-income careers do not play a role for the gender gap in private pensions among pension receivers, the gender gap would be even larger, if as many mothers as fathers had low-income careers (Table <ref type="table">A8</ref>, M4). Thus, while having lowincome careers helps to create access to private pensions for women, it does not help to equalise the private pension entitlements between men and women but would even worsen the GPG among private pension receivers. The negative explained component in the main model for stable low-income careers of fathers (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>) is thus driven by the much lower pension entitlements of men with such life courses, once they have access. Furthermore, among the private pension recipients, women with low-income careers have higher private pension returns compared to men, which cushions the gender gap in private pensions (Table <ref type="table">A8</ref>, M4, returns component).</p><p>Lastly, the results confirm the assumption that the negative composition part due to women's lack of civil service in the main model is driven by the lack of civil servants to invest in private pensions in the first place. The association of the civil service cluster with the Gender Coverage Gap is strongest among all life course patterns (-60%, cluster 3, Table <ref type="table">A8</ref>, M3) while there is no association with the gender gap in private pensions among pension recipients (Table <ref type="table">A8,</ref><ref type="table">M4</ref>).</p><p>Previous studies applying two-part models have found mixed results. My results somewhat confirm previous results <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Johnson et al. 1999</ref>) that wage matters for both, gender differences in access to as well as entitlement with private pensions and stand in contrast to the finding that wage plays a role for the gender gap in private pension receipt only <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Ezeyi and Vujic 2017)</ref>. Other findings suggested that the gender differences in the years in (full-time) employment are more important for explaining the gender coverage gap, while wage differences are more important for explaining the Gender Pension Gap among pension recipients <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Even and Macpherson 2004)</ref>. My results suggest that having a stable full-time employment career and not being engaged in continuous care work is important for gaining access to private pensions in the first place. But earnings differences matter at least as much since raising the share of women with high-income compared to low-income careers would decrease the Gender Coverage Gap twice as much. Wage differences, the employment type and continuous unpaid care do also matter for gender differences in private pension receipt in West Germany. Further, taking a holistic life course perspective the results of this analysis do not confirm the negative role of women's more years of parttime work that previous work has found for women's compared to men's private pensions receipt in England <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Ezeyi and Vujic 2017)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Public pensions</head><p>For public pensions, I do not decompose the Gender Coverage Gap because of the almost universal coverage of public pensions.</p><p>When excluding individuals without any public pensions, the gender gap in public pensions decreases slightly from €10,829 (58,26%, Table <ref type="table">A9</ref>, M1) to €10,603 (56.02%, Table <ref type="table">A9</ref>, M5) because mostly women are affected by zero pension (41 women compared to 12 men).</p><p>Overall, the results from the main analysis are confirmed. Thus, the results for public pensions are not sensitive to pension receipt and are comparable to studies that exclude individuals without any pension claims <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Rowold 2023)</ref>.</p><p>Differences in the results compared previous literature, most importantly regarding care-work and part-time employment-dominated life courses, are not due to conceptual decisions on how to deal with pension receipt. On the contrary, the explained shares tend to increase even slightly, especially for the two female-dominated clusters <ref type="bibr">(5 and 6)</ref>.</p></div>			</div>
