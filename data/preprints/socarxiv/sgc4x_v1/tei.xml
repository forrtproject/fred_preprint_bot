<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>War is rare not primarily because states settle disputes peacefully but because they have nothing to dispute. To address this simple but oft-neglected reality, I propose the concept of claimability, defined as the appropriateness of making a claim. Focusing on three international norms that emerged after the world wars (territorial integrity, self-determination, and maritime sovereignty), I construct a new dataset of states' claimable areas from 1946 to 2024. I illustrate the usefulness of this concept by applying it to oil and conflict. By leveraging the records of over 600,000 wildcat drills, natural experiments, and difference-in-differences, I demonstrate that fuel resources increase interstate conflicts only when discovered in areas claimable to multiple states. The extensive analyses of validity, heterogeneity, and mechanisms, as well as the "most-similar" case study, provide further evidence. These findings reveal the crucial role of claimability; states claim and dispute only when international norms permit such actions.</p></div>

Among 2,519 "politically relevant" dyads from 1946 to 2001 available in the Issue Correlates of War dataset (ICoW; <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Frederick, Hensel, and Macaulay 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Hensel et al. 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b124">Mitchell 2020</ref>), 1 only 1.5% had military conflicts, including military threats, displays, clashes, and wars. Among 98.5% of the observations with no military conflicts, only 6% had disputes in the ICoW dataset, and 94% had no disputes. 2   Apparently, most states did not fight because they had nothing to dispute.</p><p>These stylized facts highlight a crucial but oft-neglected aspect of peace: the absence of dispute. While many studies have addressed this issue only with ad hoc approaches, such as subsampling to "politically relevant" dyads, other studies have theoretically and empirically analyzed why states dispute in the first place <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Frederick, Hensel, and Macaulay 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Goertz and Diehl 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Hensel et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Hensel and Mitchell 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b149">Toft 2014</ref>).

While Castile and Portugal claimed the entirety of the Earth and signed the Treaty of Tordesillas in 1494, the European powers disputed and 1 The politically relevant dyads include contiguous countries and all pairs with major powers.</p><p>2 Currently, the ICoW dataset is globally available only for territorial, maritime, and identity disputes. Because states can dispute over other issues, the number of disputes is understated.</p><p>However, this will not change the big picture; many dyads had nothing to dispute. This fact should be even more evident with the sample of all dyads. partitioned Africa in 1884, and similar attempts were made for China in the early 20th century, those actions are even unimaginable in the present world. Such a drastic change cannot be explained without referring to the emergence of anti-colonialism and territorial integrity norms after the world wars <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Altman 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Altman and Lee 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b159">Zacher 2001)</ref>.</p><p>It is therefore crucial to ask the question of claimability: what makes certain territorial claims appropriate while making other claims inappropriate? Although claimability can be defined for any claim, I especially focus on territorial claims-claims over terrestrial lands and waters. A territory is claimable if the claim is consistent with international norms such as international laws, practices, and customs. A territory is disputable if it is claimable for more than one state. When a territory is claimable, it reduces subjective costs for making a claim, and through strategic interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Fearon 1995)</ref>, it can trigger a military conflict.</p><p>To be clear, the logic of claimability-a theory that explains how claimability links to actual claims, disputes, and conflicts-is incomplete. The theory states that claimability reduces the subjective costs of making territorial claims. This statement is incomplete as an explanation of military conflicts, as it does not explain why states cannot peacefully settle the disputes <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Fearon 1995)</ref>. Moreover, the concept of claimability is empty without measurement <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Abramson and Carter 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Huth 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b104">Karreth, Tir, and Gibler 2022)</ref>. Indeed, without measurement, it is even tautological to argue that states claim territories because they are claimable. Claimability must be measured independently of actual claims. I address those issues by providing a new claimability dataset. Built on the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Branch 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b138">Schultz 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b141">Simmons 2005</ref>; Simmons and Goemans 2021), I consider three sets of international norms: territorial integrity (i.e., claims over current and former territorial lands; <ref type="bibr">Abramson and</ref><ref type="bibr">Carter 2016, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Carter 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Carter and</ref><ref type="bibr">Goemans 2011, 2014)</ref>, selfdetermination and irredentism (i.e., claims over foreign co-ethnicities; <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Cederman et al. 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Goemans and Schultz 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b125">MÃ¼ller-Crepon, Schvitz, and Cederman 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b143">Siroky and Hale 2017)</ref>, and sovereignty over marine areas (i.e., territorial waters, continental shelves, and exclusive economic zones; <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">Mitchell 2020)</ref>. The new dataset captures the geographical extent of the claimable and disputable areas from 1946 to 2024, allowing me to quantify which states can potentially claim and dispute which areas. Importantly, unlike existing datasets <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Frederick, Hensel, and Macaulay 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b104">Karreth, Tir, and Gibler 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b136">Sarkees and Schafer 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b139">Schultz 2017</ref>), my measurement is not directly based on actual claims or disputes and, thus, can be used as a predictor of disputes.</p><p>Moreover, because the logic of claimability is incomplete as an explanation of military conflicts, I incorporate a direct trigger of bargaining failures: discoveries of giant oil and gas fields <ref type="bibr">(Caselli, Morelli, and Rohner 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Chisadza et al. 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b139">Schultz 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b145">StrÃ¼ver and Wegenast 2018</ref>). Among many factors, fuel discoveries are particularly illustrative as they have explicit geographical locations, allowing me to measure which states can claim which oil/gas fields. Moreover, theoretical studies have formalized the mechanisms; fuel discoveries cause a power shift, commitment problem, and thus military conflict <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Bell and Wolford 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Carey et al. 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Fearon 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr">LangÃ¸, Bell, and Wolford 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b132">Powell 2006)</ref>. Therefore, I posit that when an oil/gas field is discovered in an area that is claimable to multiple states, it creates the potential for a bargaining failure, thereby increasing the likelihood of military conflicts. I test the hypothesis by combining the dataset of claimable areas with a fine-grained dataset of over 600,000 wildcat drills. For causal identification, I leverage as-if random variation in fuel discoveries conditional on wildcat drills. I further harness the design by integrating the staggered difference-in-differences (DiD) and its recent refinements <ref type="bibr" target="#b157">(Xu 2023)</ref>.</p><p>The empirical analysis indicates that although fuel discoveries in general did not significantly affect military conflicts, they increased the likelihood of military conflicts by eight percentage points when the oil/gas fields were discovered in areas claimable for multiple states. The effect persisted for several decades. Moreover, the analyses of causal mechanisms indicate that while fuel discoveries in disputable areas did not increase fuel production or government revenues, they increased the military capabilities of relevant states, thereby widening the gap in their respective capabilities. These results suggest the fuel discoveries increased the salience of disputes, incentivized the states to expand their militaries, and thus escalated the disputes into military conflicts. I illustrate the mechanism with a "most similar" case study of two gas fields-Pinghu and Chunxiao-in the East China Sea.</p><p>These findings advance our understanding of both territorial norms and resource conflicts. Although many studies have analyzed territorial norms, 3 they examine either a particular set of norms (e.g., former territorial boundaries or irredentism) or have limited geographical and temporal scope (e.g., Europe or Africa), and overlook marine areas <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">(Mitchell 2020</ref>). The narrow focus not only compromises the external validity but also masks possible inconsistencies across different norms <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Findley, Kikuta, and Denly 2021)</ref>. Although territorial norms can facilitate cooperation by reducing uncertainties and transaction costs <ref type="bibr">(Abramson and</ref><ref type="bibr">Carter 2016, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Carter 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Carter and</ref><ref type="bibr">Goemans 2011, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b141">Simmons 2005)</ref>, their multiplicity and inconsistency create room for different interpretations and manipulations. My dataset explicitly accounts for those inconsistencies across different norms, highlighting the political aspects of international norms.</p><p>The concept of claimability also helps us understand the mixed findings about oil and conflict. While ample evidence exists for the effects of oil on intrastate conflicts (e.g., civil 3 Abramson and Carter 2016, 2021; Branch 2017; Carter 2017; Carter and Goemans 2011;   Cederman et al. 2024; Goemans and Schultz 2017; MÃ¼ller-Crepon, Schvitz, and Cederman   2024; Schultz 2015; Simmons 2005; Simmons and Goemans 2021; Siroky and Hale 2017.  claimability, the empirical models overpredict disputes. The lack of model fit, coupled with weak causal identification, can explain the mixed findings in previous studies. This points to the last but not least contribution of this study: refinement of causal identification. Although earlier studies have naively regressed conflicts on oil dependency (e.g., oil revenues per GDP) and production amounts, it is widely recognized that they are endogenous to confounders and conflicts themselves <ref type="bibr">(Cotet and Tsui 2013a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Hunziker and Cederman 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b130">Paine 2016)</ref>. Recent studies use oil deposits and discoveries as more exogenous predictors. However, as acknowledged by several authors <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Bell and Wolford 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Carey et al. 2022)</ref>, oil deposits and discoveries depend on the frequency of wildcat drills (i.e., exploratory drilling of oil and gas fields) and thus are endogenous to investments, energy policies, political regimes, and, potentially, conflicts themselves <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Bohn and Deacon 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Brunnschweiler and Poelhekke 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Cust and Harding 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b122">Meserve 2014)</ref>. I address those limitations by conditioning on the number of wildcat drills. 7 That is, given a certain number of wildcat drills, it is as-if random whether a giant oil or gas deposit is discovered. Although this design is widely used in economics and other fields, to the best of my knowledge, it has not 7 An alternative approach is to use the characteristics of sedimentary basins as instrumental variables for oil reserves <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Cassidy 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Hunziker and Cederman 2017)</ref>. Although this approach is promising, it cannot explain changes over time and hinges on the exclusion restriction. Another approach is to use global oil price as an exogenous predictor <ref type="bibr">(Andersen, Nordvik, and Tesei 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Blankenship et al. 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Denly et al. 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b129">Nwokolo 2022)</ref>. However, as Bueno de Mesquita (2020) argues, global oil price affects nearly all countries, making it difficult to find appropriate control units. Moreover, a study shows that even the anticipation of conflicts can affect global oil prices, indicating a potential for reverse causality (C. C. <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">Lee, Olasehinde-Williams, and Akadiri 2021)</ref>. been applied to political science <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Arezki, Ramey, and Sheng 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Cavalcanti, Da Mata, and Toscani 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">Cotet and</ref><ref type="bibr">Tsui 2013a, 2013b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Cust et al. 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b110">Lei and Michaels 2014)</ref>. I also address biases due to anticipatory behaviors (i.e., the anticipation of oil discoveries may affect conflicts; <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Basedau, Rustad, and Must 2018)</ref> by applying the staggered DiD, event study, and their recent refinements <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">(Hassell and Holbein 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b157">Xu 2023</ref>). The research design, together with the new dataset, helps us understand the effects of fuel discoveries on interstate conflicts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theory: Claimability in International Relations</head><p>Claimability refers to the appropriateness of making a certain claim. Thus, it sets potential conditions for making a claim. Although appropriateness ultimately depends on policymakers' subjective evaluations, it also rests on common knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Finnemore and Sikkink 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b155">Wendt 1999</ref>). Whether one state considers an act appropriate depends on whether other states consider it appropriate. Thus, while admitting potential roles of leaders' preferences (e.g., ideologies) and domestic politics <ref type="bibr">(Colgan 2010</ref><ref type="bibr">(Colgan , 2011</ref><ref type="bibr">(Colgan , 2014))</ref>, I focus on the international aspects of claimability: whether international norms designate particular territorial claims as appropriate or not <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Forsberg 1996)</ref>. International norms refer to "standard[s] of appropriate behavior" <ref type="bibr">(Finnemore and Sikkink 1998, 891)</ref>, including international laws, states' actual practices, and customs. I particularly focus on claimability over territories including terrestrial lands and waters. 8 If a state's claim over a territory is consistent with international norms, the territory is claimable to the state. If a territory is claimable to more than one state, the territory is disputable to those states. Importantly, claimability and disputability refer to potentials for claims and disputes and thus conceptually differ from actual claims and disputes. Finally, while a claim and dispute refer to verbal actions and interactions, a conflict involves military actions such as 8 See footnote 3 for reference. a threat, force display, clash, and war. The theoretical question that I ask is how claimability links to international conflicts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Logic of Claimability</head><p>My answer to the question is straightforward: when a territory is claimable to multiple states, it lowers the subjective costs for making claims, incentivizing the states to claim and dispute the territory. Because military conflict does not occur without disputes, claimability sets a necessary condition for military conflicts. Although this does not mean that claimability necessarily triggers conflicts, discoveries of fuel resources escalate the disputes to military conflicts through mechanisms proposed by previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Bell and Wolford 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Carey et al. 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b132">Powell 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b145">StrÃ¼ver and Wegenast 2018)</ref>. Although I theoretically and empirically consider the mechanisms of escalation, the logic of claimability abstracts away from the mechanisms of escalation; it states that when a territory is claimable, states claim it.</p><p>To be concrete, let me consider a stylized model. States A and B decide whether they claim a certain territory worth a value of 1. Importantly, claiming a territory requires costs ð ð´ , ð ðµ â¥ 0, representing subjective costs for making a claim. Claimability is inversely related to ð ð´ and ð ðµ (e.g., low costs mean high claimability). If neither claim, the status quo is maintained. If only one state claims, the state gains the territory without a dispute. However, if both make claims, they dispute and thus enter into a bargaining subgame G. I intentionally abstract away from the exact protocol of G, assuming that the bargaining gives expected payoffs of ð¢ ð´ (G), ð¢ ðµ (G) â¤ 1 and fails with a probability of ð â [0, 1] . As common in bargaining models, a bargaining failure is assumed to result in a military conflict <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Fearon 1995)</ref>. Furthermore, based on previous studies and a later discussion about mechanisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Bell and Wolford 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Carey et al. 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b145">StrÃ¼ver and Wegenast 2018)</ref>, I assume a bargaining failure is more likely when an oil/gas field is discovered in the disputed territory: ð(fuel) = ð &gt; ð = ð(Â¬fuel ).</p><p>Table 1 summarizes the structure of the game. At the Subgame Perfect Equilibrium, States A and B claim and thus dispute the territory if and only if ð ð´ &lt; ð¢ ð´ * (G) and ð ðµ &lt; ð¢ ðµ * (G) , where ð¢ â¢ * (G) is an expected utility at the equilibrium of bargaining subgame G. 9 The small costs allow the states to claim and thus dispute the territory. This leads to a supplementary hypothesis that is used to check the construct validity of claimability data;</p><p>Hypothesis 0: When a territory is disputable, states are more likely to dispute the territory.</p><p>Although this hypothesis is unsurprising, a more important insight is that states bargain only when they dispute the territory, and the bargaining is more likely to fail with a fuel discovery.</p><p>Thus, States A and B dispute and are unable to strike a bargain when a fuel resource is discovered in mutually claimable (aka. disputable) areas. This leads to the main hypothesis;</p><p>Hypothesis 1: When a fuel resource is discovered in a disputable territory, states are more likely to engage in a military conflict.</p><p>A caveat is that the likelihood of a dispute itself does not directly depend on a fuel discovery in disputable areas. While a fuel discovery can raise ð¢ â¢ * (G) by increasing the salience of the territory, it can also reduce ð¢ â¢ * (G) by increasing the likelihood of a bargaining failure, military conflict, and associated costs. Depending on which effect prevails, a dispute becomes more or less likely. In short, claimability increases the likelihood of disputes, and a fuel 9 The solution of the game is provided in Appendix A1.</p><p>Table 1.

Taken together, fuel discoveries in disputable areas increase the likelihood of military conflicts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mechanisms: Commitment Problem and Increased Salience</head><p>Although the model abstracts away from the mechanism of escalation (i.e., subgame G), it is worthwhile to explain what causes a bargaining failure. Based on <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Fearon (1995)</ref> and later studies, I posit two mechanisms: commitment problem and increased salience (Bell and Wolford 2014; Blankenship et al. 2024; Hendrix 2017; S. Lee 2024; StrÃ¼ver and Wegenast 2018). To be clear, I do not argue that those mechanisms are the only causes of bargaining failures or escalation. The main contribution of this study lies in the concept of claimability, and future studies should more comprehensively test the mechanisms.</p><p>The first possibility is a commitment problem; a fuel discovery causes a differential power shift and thus incentivizes a weakening state to initiate a preventive conflict <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Bell and Wolford 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Fearon 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b132">Powell 2006)</ref>. A fuel resource can provide additional revenue and thus allow military expansion. Consequently, if States A and B divide the oil/gas revenue based on their current power balance, a stronger side receives more revenues and thus more rapidly expands its military forces. As a result, a weaker side has no incentive to accept such a settlement and, instead, initiate a military conflict to obtain full control over the territory. The bargaining fails because a peaceful settlement unevenly benefits a stronger side, incentivizing a weaker side to refuse the deal and thus enter into a military conflict.</p><p>Another possibility is increased salience; a fuel discovery increases the salience of a territory, which in turn incentivizes states to engage in military conflicts <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">(Hensel et al. 2008)</ref>.</p><p>States usually experience minor power shifts or asymmetric information (i.e., their powers are always changing, and no state has complete information about other states). However, those factors do not cause conflicts because the costs of a military conflict outweigh its expected benefits. Indeed, a power shift results in a bargaining failure only when the degree of the power shift is sufficiently large relative to the costs of a military conflict. Discoveries of fuel resources increase the salience of territorial claims and hence decrease the relative costs for military actions. Even worse, fuel discoveries can flare petro-nationalism, pressuring leaders to take expansionist policies <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Chiozza and Goemans 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Goemans and Fey 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b131">Park, Abolfathi, and Ward 1976)</ref>. The increased salience exacerbates the existing bargaining problems and thus results in a military conflict.</p><p>While the logic of a commitment problem is well specified, it may not explain military conflicts between major powers, where fuel revenues comprise only a small fraction of total revenues. Given the sheer size of military budgets, it is difficult to argue that fuel discoveries greatly affect the power balance of major powers. 10 By contrast, while the salience mechanism is rather abstract, it can explain a broader set of military conflicts.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Territorial Integrity</head><p>The first and foremost is the norm of territorial integrity, which refers to the states' rights to defend their borders and their obligations to respect the borders of other states. Obviously, states can validly claim their control over their current territorial lands. The territorial integrity norm emerged after the Treaty of Westphalia and was established after World War I <ref type="bibr" target="#b159">(Zacher 2001)</ref>. However, the norm has also been subject to multiple interpretations. Territorial integrity norm can justify the restoration of lost territories <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">(Murphy 1990</ref>).

Given the limited number of territorial changes after World War II, the areas are rather limited <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Altman 2020)</ref>. I exclude former colonial lands (e.g., the UK's claim over British India after its independence), as the norm of anti-colonization barred the restoration of colonial empires. 11</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Self-determination</head><p>The territorial integrity norm, however, has been challenged by the norm of self-determination <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Cederman et al. 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Forsberg 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Goemans and Schultz 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b125">MÃ¼ller-Crepon, Schvitz, and Cederman 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b143">Siroky and Hale 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b159">Zacher 2001)</ref>. Although self-determination refers to the rights of ethnic or national groups to form their own states, the states have used it to justify irredentism-claims over foreign co-ethnicities and their lands. Although the idea of self-determination is traced back to the French Revolution in 1789, it emerged as an international norm after World War I when Woodrow Wilson announced the Fourteen Points in 1918. After World War II, the UN Charter referred to self-determination as one of the purposes of the United Nations.</p><p>Therefore, I include lands of co-ethnicities in foreign countries as claimable areas for</p><p>1946-2024. The information about the geographical distribution of ethnic groups is derived from the GREG dataset, which is based on the Soviet Atlas Narodov Mira (Weidmann, RÃ¸d,   11 India's claimability over the former British Raj is also excluded. The data on country boundaries and colonial lands are derived from the CShapes dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b153">(Weidmann, Kuse, and Gleditsch 2010)</ref>. CShapes dataset assigns disputed areas to the effective controller of the areas <ref type="bibr" target="#b153">(Weidmann, Kuse, and Gleditsch 2010)</ref>. I follow their coding rule and include all lost territories where states exercised effective control. This means that disputed areas are not always coded as disputable areas, and thus, the dataset does not directly depend on actual disputes. and Cederman 2010). 12 Because the population sizes are not available in the GREG, I use the geographical extents to identify co-ethnic groups of each country. For each country, I identify co-ethnic groups as (i) an ethnic group of the largest geographical extent within the country compared to other groups, or (ii) ethnic groups whose geographical extents are the largest in the country compared to their extents in other countries. 13 The geographical extents of the coethnic groups comprise claimable areas. Finally, I limit the claimable areas to those contiguous to the main lands of a country to exclude the claims over diasporas (e.g., overseas Chinese), who are only dispersedly populated across remote areas. Although states may act for the protection of foreign diasporas, they can hardly claim control over the lands of diasporas.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Maritime Sovereignty</head><p>Finally, although the term "territory" is often interchangeably used with lands, territory also includes water areas (e.g., "territorial sea"; Mitchell 2020). Even compared to the norms about territorial lands, the maritime norms are ambiguous and inconsistent. Indeed, territorial water is a relatively new concept. In the 19th century or earlier, different states set different extents of territorial seas, ranging from 4 to 12 nautical miles from the coast, often reflecting the reaches of cannons. The interwar periods saw several attempts to codify territorial seas (e.g., the 1930 League of Nations Codification Conference), but states failed to agree on the exact extent of territorial seas.</p><p>12 I do not use the GeoEPR dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b156">(Wucherpfennig et al. 2011</ref>) because the political inclusion/exclusion of ethnic groups is not relevant to irredentism and is endogenous to conflict. 16 Although few states, such as Chile and Peru, declared sovereignty over the 200 nautical miles after the Truman Proclamation, the EEZs were hardly considered international norms <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Carroz 1987</ref>). In the 1940s to 1960s, Western and Asian countries instead adopted sovereignty over continental shelves, and only a handful of countries in Latin America adopted the EEZs. In the 1970s, the newly independent African countries supported the notion of the EEZs (e.g., the</p><p>Importantly, territorial seas and continental shelves can potentially overlap other countries' EEZs. The overlapping areas constitute disputable areas, and I call them disputable seas. Figure 2 presents the extent of claimable and disputable areas in 2012. The claimable areas on lands and seas are denoted as light and dark ivory colors. The disputable areas include the intersections of current and past territorial lands (gray zones), current territorial lands and foreign ethnic minorities (red zones), and territorial seas or EEZs and continental shelves (blue zones). Although disputable seas are rare, there are a modest number of lost lands, especially in the former Soviet region (Altman 2020; Mitchell 2020). Foreign ethnic minorities are widespread in Africa, reflecting their artificial national borders (Goemans and Schultz 2017; Michalopoulos and Papaioannou 2016). 17 In the main analysis, I combine lost lands, irredentism, and disputable seas, and later disaggregate them. 1971 meeting of the Asian-African Legal Consultative Committee, and the 1973 Addis Ababa</p><p>Declaration), but, even at that moment, it is difficult to argue that the norm was widely accepted.</p><p>It was the nine years of fierce negotiation at the UNCLOS III meetings <ref type="bibr">(1973)</ref><ref type="bibr">(1974)</ref><ref type="bibr">(1975)</ref><ref type="bibr">(1976)</ref><ref type="bibr">(1977)</ref><ref type="bibr">(1978)</ref><ref type="bibr">(1979)</ref><ref type="bibr">(1980)</ref><ref type="bibr">(1981)</ref><ref type="bibr">(1982)</ref>) that set the EEZ as one of the basic principles regarding maritime sovereignty <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Carroz 1987)</ref>. For these reasons, I consider the period from 1983 to 2024. I use the year of signature (1982) instead of the years of ratifications to remove possible selections by signatory states. Because the EEZs can start from remote islands, I added remote islands to the CShapes dataset. The data on remote islands are derived from Natural Earth (2024), which contains small islands down to 10 meters. However, due to the data limitation, tiny islands smaller than 10 meters are not included in the dataset (e.g., Okinotori-Shima in Japan). 17 Irredentism is also widespread in the Arabian Peninsula as people are classified as Arabs.</p><p>Removing Arabian countries does not change the results of the main analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Design: Natural Experiment with Fuel Discoveries</head><p>To demonstrate the usefulness of the new dataset, I analyze the effects of fuel discoveries on interstate conflict and how the effect differs between fuel discoveries in disputable and other areas. Fuel discoveries are especially illustrative as they have explicit geographical locations, allowing me to identify disputable and non-disputable discoveries. 18 However, causal identification poses a challenge; fuel discoveries depend on wildcat drills, which are endogenous to investment, energy policies, and conflicts themselves (Bohn and Deacon 2000;   18 Although it is possible to extend the analysis to non-fuel resources, no data about exploratory mining are available, making it difficult to use the same research design <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Balestri 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Denly et al. 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Gilmore et al. 2005)</ref>. Moreover, much less attention has been paid to the effects of non-fuel resources on interstate conflicts <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">(Koubi et al. 2014)</ref>. Other factors such as mass mobilization, military expansion, leadership turnover, trade, and economic sanction do not have explicit geographical locations, making it difficult to use the claimability dataset.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 2. Claimable and Disputable Areas in 2012</head><p>The figure shows claimable areas on lands (light ivory) and seas (dark ivory). The land areas of lost territories and foreign co-ethnic groups are denoted as Lost Lands and Irredentism, respectively (gray and red zones). When a continental shelf overlaps other countries' territorial seas or EEZs, the area is denoted as a disputable sea (blue zone).</p><p>Brunnschweiler and Poelhekke 2021; Cust and Harding 2020; Meserve 2014). I address this problem by conditioning on the number of wildcat drills.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> illustrates the research design with a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). <ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">19</ref> The quantities of interest are the effects of fuel discoveries in disputable and non-disputable areas on military conflicts (solid lines). The research design does not assume that fuel discoveries are unconditionally exogenous or that the number of wildcat drills is exogenous. It instead assumes that the number of fuel discoveries is exogenous conditional on the number of wildcat drills (dashed lines). Although geological surveys, investments, politics, disputability, and conflicts can affect whether a country conducts or permits wildcat drills, given a certain number of wildcat drills, their results-whether wildcat drills discover giant fuel reserves-are plausibly exogenous. This implies that by "blocking" wildcat drills in Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>, fuel discoveries become independent of confounders. This design is valid unless confounders affect fuel discoveries other than their effects through the number of wildcat drills (i.e., no arrows from confounders to fuel discoveries in Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>). Because confounders affect fuel discoveries only through their effects on the quantity or quality of wildcat drills, this assumption holds unless confounders affect the quality of wildcat drills (i.e., drilling technologies). In a later validity check, I consider possible violations of the assumption.</p><p>Furthermore, I combine the natural experiment with the DiD to account for static confounders. Although oil and gas are more likely to be found in areas of certain geological characteristics <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Cassidy 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Hunziker and Cederman 2017)</ref>, those static features cannot explain changes over time. Therefore, I compare the changes in the likelihood of military conflicts with and without giant fuel discoveries. Moreover, the event study describes the changes in the likelihood of military conflicts before and after the treatment, allowing me to check anticipatory behaviors. In my setup, the years of giant fuel discoveries vary across units, and thus the design is a staggered DiD (Goodman-Bacon 2021; Xu 2023). Thus, although the analysis may still be subject to limitations, I believe the research design, together with extensive additional analyses, improves the existing approaches in political science.</p></div>

The summary statistics are available in</p><p>Table A 2-1 of Appendix A2. Outcome Variables The main outcome variable for testing Hypothesis 1 is the incidence of military conflicts. The data are derived from the Militarized Interstate Disputes (MID) dataset by the Correlates of War (CoW) project-a standard dataset of interstate conflicts (Sarkees and Schafer 2000). The outcome variable ð ðð¼ð·,ððð¡ takes 1 if there is any MID between country ð and ð in year ð¡. 21 The MIDs include any disputes involving military actions, such as threats, displays, clashes, and wars. About 4.43% of observations experienced MIDs. I later analyze each type of military actions and check the robustness to different measurements (Braithwaite and Lemke 2011). The supplementary outcome variable for testing Hypothesis 0 is the incidence of disputes. The data are derived from the ICoW dataset (Frederick, Hensel, and Macaulay 2017; Hensel et al. 2024; Mitchell 2020). The ICoW dataset is available only up to 2001, resulting in a smaller sample size (ð = 16,366). The outcome variable ð ð¼ð¶ðð,ððð¡ takes 1 if there is any dispute over lands, seas, or identity groups between country ð and ð in year ð¡. 22 Note that, states. See later robustness checks. The sample starts from 1946 as the claimability dataset is based on the norms that emerged after the world wars. Although the sample could be extended to the interwar period, it adds highly heterogenous observations (i.e., WWII). The sample ends in 2012 as the MID dataset is available only up to 2012. unlike the main outcome variable, ð ð¼ð¶ðð,ððð¡ includes both militarized and non-militarized disputes. About 26.0% of the observations experienced disputes. Treatment and Control Variables The treatment variable is the discovery of giant oil and/or gas fields in disputable areas. The information about the locations and years of fuel discoveries is derived from two sources: Cust et al. (2022) and Enverus (2024). Cust et al. (2022) extend the dataset of Horn (2003) to 2018. The dataset contains information about the locations and years of giant fuel discoveries (&gt;500 million barrels of oil equivalent). Because this dataset contains only wildcat drills related to giant fields, I supplement it with the industry-standard dataset compiled by Enverus (2024), which contains the records of over 600,000 wildcat drills for the period of analysis. 23 With those data sources, I calculate the number of giant fuel discoveries and wildcat drills in disputable areas. The main treatment variable ððð ððð£ððð¦ ððð ðð¢ð¡ðððð,ððð¡ takes 1 if a giant fuel was discovered in areas that are disputable between country ð and ð. 24 This variable takes 1 for all years after a giant fuel discovery until the location of the oil/gas field ceases to be claimable for country ð or ð . The corresponding control variable ððððð ððð ðð¢ð¡ðððð,ððð¡ is the cumulative number of wildcat drills in areas disputable for country ð and ð up to year ð¡. I use the cumulative number of wildcat drills because the assignment probability of ððð ððð£ððð¦ ððð ðð¢ð¡ðððð,ððð¡ depends on the number of all wildcat drills up to year ð¡. 25 I also create corresponding variables for giant fuel discoveries and wildcat drills in all claimable areas for country ð and ð (ððð ððð£ððð¦ ððð,ððð¡ , ððððð ððð,ððð¡ ), and for giant fuel discoveries and wildcat drills in areas claimable to either country ð or ð (ððð ððð£ððð¦ Â¬ððð ðð¢ð¡ðððð,ððð¡ , ððððð Â¬ððð ðð¢ð¡ðððð,ððð¡ ). 26 Finally, I create an indicator variable ððð ðð¢ð¡ðððð ððð¡ that takes 1 if country ð and ð possess any disputable areas in year ð¡. Except for those variables, I do not include other covariates (e.g., democracies and GDP per capita) and leave the analysis with additional control variables for a later robustness check. As far as ððð ððð£ððð¦ ððð ðð¢ð¡ðððð,ððð¡ is randomly assigned conditional on ððððð ððð ðð¢ð¡ðððð,ððð¡ , there is no need to include additional control variables. Indeed, because those endogenous variables can be affected by fuel discoveries, controlling for them can induce post-treatment control biases (Angrist and Pischke 2009). Specification With those variables, I use the two-way fixed-effects (TWFE) model. While acknowledging the problems of TWFE models (Goodman-Bacon 2021; Xu 2023), I prefer not to rely on 25 The results are robust when controlling for the number of contemporaneous drills.

I also exclude years after treatment reversal, where oil/gas fields ceased to be disputable for countries ð and ð (e.g., the UK after the independence of its colonies). In the staggered DiD, those observations are inappropriate control units. The treated dyads, for instance, should be compared to the never-treated dyads (i.e., the dyads without any giant fuel discoveries in disputable areas) or the not-yet-treated units (i.e., the dyads before giant fuel discoveries in disputable areas), instead of the always-treated or once-treated units (Goodman-Bacon 2021).

Foreign co-ethnicities and disputable seas increased land disputes (Column 2), reflecting the fact that maritime disputes often involve disputes over remote islands (e.g., Senkaku/Diaoyudao islands between Japan and China). While no predictors are associated with identity disputes due to the extreme rarity of the outcome (Column 3), 32 disputable seas increased maritime disputes (Column 4). A rather unexpected finding is that lost lands are negatively associated with land and maritime disputes. Since the model includes the fixed effects, the estimate captures the changes in the likelihood of disputes before and after land losses. Because land losses often mark dispute settlements or ends of war, they temporarily reduce disputes. Indeed, without fixed effects, lost lands are positively and significantly associated with land disputes. 32 Only 0.7% of the observations had identity disputes. This is about one sixth of the land or maritime disputes.</p></div>

Although the theoretical relationship is indeterminate (see a caveat on p.9), the analysis indicates that giant fuel discoveries increased the likelihood of disputes, implying that the dispute-inducing effects of fuel discoveries outweighed their soothing effects.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Validity Checks</head><p>I check the covariate balance first by regressing the treatment variable on covariates, including alliance, military capabilities, democracies, state ownership of the economy, GDP per capita, and population size with control for the number of wildcat drills in disputable areas. As shown in Table <ref type="table">A</ref> 4-1 of Appendix A4, only one-alliance-among ten predictors is significantly associated with fuel discoveries in disputable areas, which is not surprising given the multiple hypothesis testing. To be sure, I control for the covariates and find similar results in a robustness check.</p><p>In Figure A 4-1 of Appendix A4, I also conduct placebo tests by using failed wildcat drills (i.e., no discoveries of fuel resources) and minor discoveries (discoveries of less than 500 million barrels or unknown amounts) as placebo treatments. Because those placebos are unlikely to cause power shifts or increase the salience of the territory, they should not affect MIDs. The estimates are indeed null and close to zero.</p><p>However, there are remaining concerns. Unobserved confounders can affect not only the quantity but also the quality of wildcat drills. For example, restrictions on foreign direct investment may not only reduce the number of wildcat drills, but they may also hamper the use of the latest drilling technologies. I address this concern in three additional analyses. First, in</p><p>Table A 4-2 of Appendix A4 (Column 1), I control the average underground depth of wildcat drills (km) as a proxy of drilling technologies. Second, in Table A 4-2 of Appendix A4 (Column 2), I change the estimand to the difference between the effects of giant fuel discoveries in disputable and non-disputable areas (i.e., triple differences; DDD). 33 The difference cancels out the confounding effects if a country uses similar drilling technologies in disputable and non-disputable areas. Third, in Table A 4-2 of Appendix A4 (Column 3), I relax the assumption; given the number of wildcat drills and discoveries of certain amounts of fuel resources, it is random whether those discoveries are small or giant. 34 This addresses the concern as far as drilling technologies affect the discovery rates but not discovery amounts. The results are robust to any of those changes. Another concern is that disputable areas are not randomly assigned. Because disputable areas are often located near national borders, the results might reflect the effect of giant fuel discoveries near national borders. States, for instance, may fight for fuel fields around national borders, because it is tactically easier to conquer those fields (Caselli, Morelli, and Rohner 2015). I account for this possibility by excluding giant fuel discoveries within 100km of national borders from the treatment and control variables. As shown in Table A 4-2 of Appendix A4 (Column 4), the results are robust to this change. Similarly, disputable and non-disputable areas may have different geographical and other characteristics. Disputable seas, for instance, concentrate on shallow waters. Foreign ethnic minorities are also more common in ethnically diverse regions (e.g., Africa). In Table A 4-2 of Appendix A4 (Column 5), I alleviate this concern by controlling the indicator of giant fuel discoveries within 300km of disputable areas (excluding disputable areas). 35 These fields 33 To this end, I substitute ððð ððð£ððð¦ ððð,ððð¡ and ððððð ððð,ððð¡ for ððð ððð£ððð¦ Â¬ððð ðð¢ð¡ðððð,ððð¡ and ððððð Â¬ððð ðð¢ð¡ðððð,ððð¡ in Equation â¡. 34 To this end, I add the indicators of (minor or giant) fuel discoveries in disputable and nondisputable areas to Equation â¡. are not disputable, but the proximity implies that their geographical and other characteristics are similar to those in disputable areas. The results remain robust to this change. Finally, I extensively implement the recent methods for staggered DiD. The TWFE model does not estimate the average treatment effect on the treated when the effects are heterogeneous across units and over time (Goodman-Bacon 2021). Recent studies propose alternative estimators that are valid even with heterogeneous effects (see Chiu et al. 2024; Xu 2023 for reviews). In Table A 5-1 of Appendix A5, I implement those methods and find similar results across eight estimators. 36 These results are consistent with the findings by Chiu et al. (2024); heterogeneous treatment effects are less concerning than violating more critical assumptions. In Figure A 5-1 of Appendix A5, I also conduct a sensitivity check proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">Rambachan and Roth (2023)</ref>, showing that the event-study estimates (i.e., Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>) are robust to minor violations of the common trend assumption.</p></div>

By contrast, although the point estimate for military display is relatively large, those for non-militarized actions, military threat, and war are close to zero. These results are consistent with Meierding (2016b); fuel resources did not cause war but only caused "oil spats" (442).</p><p>Second, I disaggregate fuel discoveries in disputable areas to those in lost lands, foreign co-ethnic lands, and disputable seas. As shown fuel discoveries in foreign co-ethnic lands increased MIDs. Although the point estimate for fuel discoveries in disputable seas is the largest, the standard error is also large. The sample contains only a few cases of fuel discoveries in disputable seas, resulting in large standard errors. Finally, while fuel discoveries in lost lands increased land disputes (Table <ref type="table">A</ref> 3-1 in Appendix A3), they reduced MIDs (first column of 37 As <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Gibler et al.

Finally, I find that the effects are larger for gas discoveries and no different between onshore and offshore discoveries.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mechanism Checks</head><p>In the theory section, I have postulated two mechanisms: commitment problem and increased salience. Although directly testing the mechanisms is difficult, I provide indirect evidence.</p></div>

The thick and thin vertical bars are 90% and 95% confidence intervals, respectively. The standard errors are two-way clustered by country ð and ð.</p><p>First, I analyze whether discoveries of giant fuel resources increase military capabilities and alter the power balance. Because the unit of analysis is a dyad, I use the sum and difference in the military capabilities within a dyad (denoted by â and â, respectively). I log-transform the original variables, calculate the sum and difference, and standardize them. 38 The data on military capabilities are derived from the Composite Index of National Capability (CINC) by the CoW and the Material Military Power (MMP) index by <ref type="bibr" target="#b144">Souva (2023)</ref>. 39   Table <ref type="table">6</ref> provides suggestive evidence that giant fuel discoveries in disputable areas increased the total amount of military capabilities and their differences. Although the estimates are imprecise with the MMP data, the estimates are positive across all specifications. These results imply that giant fuel discoveries in disputable areas resulted in military expansion and differently affected the states. This is consistent with the commitment problem (i.e., fuel resources provide revenues for military expansion) and salience mechanisms (i.e., increased salience incentivizes the states to expand their militaries). 38 Although the log-transformation alters the identification assumption of DiD <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">(McConnell 2023)</ref>, it is necessary to log-transform the outcomes as they are very skewed. 39 The MMP index is not available for microstates.</p><p>Second, I analyze whether giant fuel discoveries in disputable areas increased the amounts of oil production and resource revenues. The data on fuel production and resource revenues are derived from <ref type="bibr" target="#b135">Ross and Mahdavi (2015)</ref> and the Government Revenue Dataset <ref type="bibr">(GRD;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b119">McNabb, Oppel, and Chachu 2023)</ref>, respectively. Like Table <ref type="table">6</ref>, I calculate, logtransform, and standardize the sums and differences in the production amounts and resource revenues in each dyad. 40 Note that the GRD is available only in a limited number of countries after 1980, resulting in many missing values.</p><p>Table <ref type="table">7</ref> provides no evidence. While fuel discoveries in non-disputable areas increased fuel production, resource revenues, and their differences within dyads (the second row of Table <ref type="table">7</ref>), I do not find similar evidence for fuel discoveries in disputable areas (the first row of Table <ref type="table">7</ref>).

These results suggest fuel discoveries in disputable areas did not provide financial resources for military expansion. A more likely scenario is that fuel discoveries in disputable areas increased the salience of the territory, which in turn incentivized the states to expand military capabilities.</p><p>Because stronger states can more rapidly expand their militaries, the arms races can result in differential growth in military capabilities.</p><p>Finally, I consider the possibility that fuel discoveries escalated disputes into conflicts regardless of their locations. When two states have a disputable area, and one state discovers fuel resources in non-disputable areas, they have sources of a dispute (i.e., disputable area) and escalation (i.e., fuel discovery).

The Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, Ichiro Aizawa, indeed stated, "I must express concerns that China developed Chunxiao very close to the median line that our country claims, and, depending on the underground structure, our rights and interests are directly violated" (November 24, 2004;</p><p>National Diet Library 2024). <ref type="foot" target="#foot_15">51</ref> The Japanese claim, in turn, reignited the disagreement over the East China Sea, which eventually escalated into a military confrontation in 2005.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>The cases of the Pinghu and Chunxiao fields illustrate how claimability sets a condition for interstate disputes. Although the two fields were closely located, Chunxiao was marginally closer to the areas claimable to Japan. This allowed Japan to make a claim, which triggered the dispute over the East China Sea. Theoretically, this story is more consistent with the increased salience, instead of the commitment problem, mechanism. It is difficult to argue that Chunxiao helped China expand the military; although Chunxiao had a relatively large deposit, its revenue was minuscule compared to the military budgets of China or Japan. A more plausible explanation is that the development of Chunxiao increased the salience of maritime sovereignty and thus escalated the dispute.</p><p>The case also provides a few additional insights. First, consistent with the findings in the statistical analysis (Table <ref type="table">5</ref>), Chunxiao did not cause war but only entailed "spats" <ref type="bibr">(Meierding 2016b</ref>). Although scholars sometimes downgrade such spats, the dispute over the East China Sea has been a major issue between Japan and China for decades, hampering their cooperation. Thus, even though oil or gas does not cause war, the analysis of conflicts over fuel resources continues to have substantive importance. Second, the platform construction of Chunxiao, instead of its initial discovery, triggered the dispute. This implies that the effect of fuel discoveries can arise several years after the discoveries. This is consistent with statistical findings in Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>, which indicates that the effects persist for a long time. Third, Tokyo Shimbun's report triggered a backlash from Japan, implying the potential role of mass media.</p><p>Although analyzing media contents across countries is beyond the scope of this paper, the empirical results indirectly support this notion. For instance, democracies may fight each other This does not mean that we can discard bargaining models or rely on the abstract concept of international norms. International norms define states' preferences and other characteristics <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Finnemore and Sikkink 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b155">Wendt 1999)</ref>. The preferences, however, turn into behaviors through strategic interactions. Moreover, the concept of claimability is useless without concrete measurements. I have addressed those issues by integrating the concept of claimability into a bargaining model and providing a new claimability dataset. These theoretical and empirical contributions lay the foundation for further studies on claimability in international relations.</p><p>Finally, the statistical analysis indicates that fuel resources cause interstate conflicts only when they are discovered in disputable areas. This finding explains the puzzling asymmetry in the literature; despite ample evidence about the effect of fuel resources on intrastate conflicts, the evidence for interstate conflicts remains mixed. I have shown that the puzzle can partly be explained by claimability. While armed groups can claim control over oil/gas fields in their countries during civil war, states cannot claim every field worldwide.</p><p>Only when a field is claimable, the states claim, dispute, and fight for it. Although <ref type="bibr">Meierding (2016a</ref><ref type="bibr">Meierding ( , 2016b) )</ref> argues that fuel discoveries cause only minor clashes, the dispute over the East China Sea suggests that such "spats" are real concerns. Future studies should examine the causes and consequences of conflicts over fuel resources, as well as their implications for the coming transition from fossil fuels <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Dizaji 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Kamada 2024)</ref>.</p></div>

In China, for instance, Han has the largest geographical extent, but there are many other minorities unique to China. If I only use criterion (i), the co-ethnicities include only Han. Criterion (ii) ensures that the other minorities unique to China are also included.The situation was further complicated in 1945 when President Harry S. Truman unilaterally declared "the exercise of jurisdiction over the natural resources of the subsoil and sea bed of the continental shelf by the contiguous nation" (1945). The Truman Proclamation was a direct challenge to existing practices; while customary laws set territorial seas as areas within a fixed distance from the coast, continental shelves depend on geographical characteristics and can potentially extend to vast areas. While many countries quickly adopted the Truman Proclamation, three Latin American countries-Chile, Ecuador, and Peruresponded differently; they proposed 200 nautical miles of territorial seas (they had long coastal lines but not continental shelves). While the 1958 Geneva Convention defined the legal properties of territorial seas, states still failed to agree on the exact extent.The situation changed in 1982 when 183 states signed the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). Territorial seas were defined as 12 nautical miles from the coast. The UNCLOS also defined exclusive economic zones (EEZ) as 200 nautical miles from the coast, granting coastal countries exclusive rights to extract resources. However, even the UNCLOS did not unequivocally define maritime sovereignty. The UNCLOS did not clearly define how to delimit the border when a country's continental shelf or EEZ overlaps those of other countries. Although the International Court of Justice (ICJ) referred to the principle of equity, citing various factors such as the length of coastlines, marine geology, and culture and history, there is no universally accepted way to delimit maritime borders.14   Given those historical developments, I operationalize claimable areas in the following manner, which accounts for both international laws and states' de facto practices; a) Territorial sea: From 1946 to 2024, the claimable areas include the territorial seas of 12 nautical miles from the coast. Even without the UNCLOS, 12 nautical miles have long been the maximum extent of territorial seas; b) Continental shelf: For the period after the Truman Proclamation (1946-2024), I include continental shelves as claimable areas. I operationalize a continental shelf as marine areas of less than 500-meter depth that are contiguous to the closest coastal country; 15 c) Exclusive economic zone (EEZ): For the period after the UNCLOS (1983-2024), the EEZs are included as claimable areas. The EEZs are measured as marine areas within 200 nautical miles of the closest coastal country. 16 15 While Truman did not provide a concrete definition of a continental shelf, the 1958 Convention on the Continental Shelf defined it as "the seabed and subsoil of the submarine areas adjacent to the coast but outside the area of the territorial sea, to a depth of 200 meters or, beyond that limit, to where the depth of the superjacent waters admits of the exploitation of the natural resources" (United Nations 1958, 2). Until the 1980s when the 1958 Convention was replaced by the UNCLOS, the exploitation of offshore oil and gas had been technologically limited to a water depth of less than 500 meters (see Figure 1 of Lunne 2012). Therefore, I use 500m instead of 200m water depth. Because the continental shelf is an extension of a continent and thus cannot start from remote islands, I do not include remote islands when I measure the continental shelves. The bathymetry data are derived from GEBCO (2024).</figDesc></figure>

As shown in Figure A 6-1 of Appendix A6, the Japan-China dyad is the most influential case in the quantitative analysis, constituting the "most likely" case. The case also provides a unique analytical opportunity for conducting the "most similar" comparison. China discovered the Pinghu and Chunxiao fields in 1983 and 1995, respectively. Importantly, the two fields were very closely located, but Chunxiao was marginally closer to the disputable area. This subtle difference allowed Japan to claim Chunxiao but not Pinghu.41   ContextsThe dispute over the East China Sea can be traced back to the geophysical surveys conducted by the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East in 1968. The survey indicated a potentially vast fuel deposit in the East China Sea<ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Emery et al. 1969)</ref>. Although the survey led to territorial disputes over the Senkaku/Diaoyudao islands among Japan, China, and Taiwan, it also set the ground for a dispute over marine areas. While China claimed its control over the continental shelf stretching from the mainland to the Okinawa Trough, Japan claimed to split41 China also discoveredTianwaitian in 1986, Baoyunting and Canxue in 1989, and Duanqiao   in 1990. Although Tianwaitian and Duanqiao were close to the median line and discovered earlier than Chunxiao, Chine developed those fields at the same time as Chunxiao (Tianwaitian) or later (Duanqiao). Japan claimed them after Chunxiao sparked the dispute.</figDesc></figure>

In fact, Japan and China signed a fishery agreement in 1975 and renewed it in 1997 to manage the disagreement.Control Case: Pinghu FieldIn the 1980s, China started the exploration of oil and gas fields in the East China Sea.

It is a task of future studies to analyze the roles of mass media more directly. Conclusion In this paper, I have proposed a concept of claimability and demonstrated its usefulness by analyzing how claimability sets a condition for fuel discoveries to cause interstate conflicts. Built on a simple model, I have hypothesized that fuel discoveries cause interstate conflicts when the resources are discovered in areas claimable to multiple states. I have tested the hypothesis by compiling the new dataset of claimability, which geo-codes three sets of international norms that had emerged after the world wars: territorial integrity, selfdetermination, and maritime sovereignty. I have combined the data with a fine-grained dataset of wildcat drills and leveraged natural experiments and DiD. The statistical analysis has indicated that giant fuel discoveries in disputable areas increased the likelihood of MIDs by eight percentage points. The extensive analyses of validity, robustness, and heterogeneity have provided further credence to the findings. I have also explored causal mechanisms with quantitative and qualitative approaches, suggesting that fuel discoveries sparked military conflicts by increasing the salience of disputable territories. These findings shed light on the crucial roles of international norms. Claimability sets a necessary condition for interstate bargaining. Without claims, states do not dispute. Without disputes, states do not bargain. Without bargaining, states do not fight. These simple but oftneglected facts force us to consider claimability; under what conditions do states make claims? Answering this question is crucial for understanding the scope condition of bargaining models. Future studies should analyze what motivates states to claim, dispute, bargain, and fight.</figDesc></figure>
