<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Nutter's employment with the CIA has been a matter of public record for decades, but the substance of his work there has been shrouded in secrecy. Many of the CIA documents relevant to Nutter's work were only declassified in the early 2000s. 2 These documents show that between the summer of 1951 and the waning months of 1952 Nutter was swiftly promoted from being a Special Assistant to the Director of the Office of Research and Reports (ORR), Max Millikan, to Acting Chief of the Economic Capabilities Branch of ORR. During this period ORR "devoted most of its attention" to intelligence on the economic capabilities Soviet Union, 3 so Nutter's projects were among the highest priorities of ORR, and thus the highest basic research priorities of the CIA. During his time at the CIA, Nutter also chaired the interagency Economic Intelligence Committee's (EIC) subcommittee on Economic Analysis. The subcommittee was charged with conducting the intelligence community's most sophisticated economic analyses, none of which were more important than assessing the Soviets' capacity to mobilize for and wage a general war.</p><p>Warren Nutter's work on the economics of a general war occurred at a time when the role of economists in defense policy was changing. Rhode (2020) argues that in the early years of the Cold War, social scientists transitioned from understanding war as a classic "social problem" that must be eliminated to understanding war as a social institution that could be harnessed. This view that social science could actively contribute to defense policy was not entirely original to the early Cold War. In the first half of the twentieth century, economists provided scientific 2 Often, Nutter's name appears directly in declassified CIA records. However, in many documents, Nutter's name is redacted, but his abbreviated title A/EC/RR (Acting Chief, Economic Capabilities Branch, Office of Research and Reports), is not redacted. A/EC/RR can be confirmed as Nutter's abbreviated title using the document "Atomic Energy Contribution to the Study on the Economic Capabilities of the Soviet Bloc to Support a General War." February 13, 1952, CIA-RDP75-00662R000100190045-5. In this document, Nutter's name is redacted but "A/EC/RR" and his office address (Room 2225 M Building) are not redacted. This documentary link between A/EC/RR and Nutter's office provides the link between the abbreviated title and Nutter himself. I will assume all documents addressed from "A/EC/RR" during Nutter's tenure are referring to Nutter.</p></div>

Warren Nutter's CIA research grew out of this older body of work, and particularly the economics of capacity and mobilization.</p><p>A critical turning point for social scientists' orientation towards war was the development of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) with nuclear payloads in the late 1950s. After the emergence of ICBMs, mobilization of an economy for total war was eclipsed by the application of rational choice theories to nuclear strategies that would "tame the terrors of decisions too consequential to be left to human reason alone" <ref type="bibr">(Erickson et al. 2013, 2)</ref>. Policymakers were less interested in knowing about the Soviets' economic potential for full mobilization, which Nutter was studying for the CIA, and more interested in formulating a strategic response to nuclear conflict. This all came towards the end of the decade, though. In the early 1950s war on the Korean Peninsula was conventional, even though it was fought in the shadow of the atomic bomb. It was in this context of conventional, total war that Nutter worked for the CIA and launched the NBER project. This paper begins in media res, at the link between <ref type="bibr">Nutter's work with the CIA in 1951 and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">1952</ref> and his selection to direct the NBER Soviet growth project. Nutter's leadership of the NBER project is celebrated by economists as a major step forward in the study of the Soviet economy, but his apparent lack of qualifications for the job has been a lingering puzzle in the historical literature on Sovietology, which assumes he was tapped for his ideological reliability. I argue that Nutter was scientifically well prepared to lead the NBER project. Nutter's research on the Soviet Union before NBER was more extensive than has been generally appreciated, and his former supervisor at the CIA spoke with the Rockefeller Foundation about the NBER project in 1953. Ideology and economics are often linked, and Nutter had unusually strong ideological commitments, but this paper suggests that appeals to ideology as driving economics are often weak historical explanations.</p><p>After establishing the CIA as a key steppingstone in Nutter's career, I provide the first account of Nutter's work at the CIA, including his hiring in 1951, the role of economic research in the agency, and the projects that Nutter managed. Nutter worked on at least three CIA research efforts. The first, Project 110-51, was a large input-output study of the Soviet economy conducted to better understand the Soviets' capability to wage a general war. Referred to as the "Capabilities Study" by analysts, Project 110-51 only ever resulted in a working paper, but it served as a template for future CIA attempts to build a complete input-output model of the Soviet economy. In addition to the Capabilities Study, Nutter managed ORR's contributions to two National Intelligence Estimates (NIEs): NIE-59 on the effects of severing East-West trade, and NIE-65 on Soviet economic capabilities through 1957.</p><p>The paper concludes with a reassessment of how the CIA influenced and interacted with Nutter and the NBER project. I show that Nutter was in close contact with the CIA throughout the NBER project and that he was better informed about the intelligence underlying Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) Allen Dulles's statements on Soviet growth than he indicated publicly. I further argue that Nutter's CIA work on input-output modeling influenced his later analysis of the difficulties of measuring economic growth under conditions of structural change.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II.</head><p>The CIA as a Stepping Stone to the NBER Nutter's CIA experience provides crucial context for understanding his selection as director of the NBER project on Soviet growth. Historians of economics do not dwell on the NBER project's origins, with Gordon <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Brady's (2009)</ref> unpublished paper on the Rockefeller Foundation's decision to fund the project being an important exception. Historians of Sovietology have been more attentive to the roots of the NBER project and have highlighted the peculiarity of Nutter's selection as project director. <ref type="bibr">Engerman (2009, 118)</ref> notes that Nutter's early research on monopoly was unrelated to the Soviet Union, which made him a "far from obvious selection." The more logical explanation for Nutter's selection, Engerman argues, is that his conservative politics appealed to the Eisenhower administration. <ref type="bibr">Kestner (1999, 231-232)</ref> also notes Nutter's lack of Soviet research experience, highlighting the brevity of his work as a consultant on a RAND study "during the summer of 1952," that "lasted only about three months." Jeffries ( <ref type="formula">2014</ref>) is less directly critical of Nutter's preparedness for the NBER work, but dismissively claims the project's goal was to produce politically palatable results for the administration. Engerman describes the project in similarly dismissive terms, calling it "the White House's end-run around the CIA," and suggesting that Nutter was guilty of "using the imprimatur of [the] NBER and money from the Rockefeller Foundation to challenge the estimates of CIA experts" <ref type="bibr">(Engerman, 2009, 121)</ref>. Although Nutter was unmistakably politically conservative, there is no evidence presented in any of these histories to support the claim that his politics were a factor in his selection to lead the NBER Soviet growth study.</p><p>Stronger circumstantial evidence suggests that far from the NBER project being an "end run around the CIA," Nutter's CIA employment was a critical factor in his selection. Robert Amory (CIA) for their input.<ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">5</ref> </p><p>This is not to say that the Rockefeller Foundation did not have a particular motivation for its grant. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Brady (2009)</ref> documents Rockefeller's determination to move Soviet studies beyond the exclusive control of the "Russian experts" who are naively thought by policymakers and the public to "possess a fund of esoteric knowledge of all things Russian." Rockefeller's decision had more to do with dueling claims to expertise than with promising any particular result. The NBER project was an example of Rockefeller's efforts at this time to diversify its grant portfolio away from the "area studies" approach to Soviet studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Engerman, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Mueller, 2013)</ref>. When Solomon Fabricant and Leo Wolman (both NBER) spoke with Joseph Willitts (Rockefeller Foundation) about the study in August, they were also "emphatic that they would not be interested in doing such a study, unless it was done on a completely scientific basis,"<ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">6</ref> possibly meant as commentary on the scientific rigor of existing area studies.</p><p>Historians of Sovietology recount Burns and Cutler's outreach to the Rockefeller Foundation, but they ignore Robert Amory's involvement. Amory's participation is significant because he directly supervised Nutter's work at ORR for most of 1952. In May, 1953, after Nutter left the CIA, Amory was promoted from director of ORR to Deputy Director of Intelligence.<ref type="foot" target="#foot_3">7</ref> Rusk already knew Amory from their time working on the planning committee for Eisenhower's Solarium Project earlier that year.<ref type="foot" target="#foot_4">8</ref> At some point in the summer of 1953 Amory met with Rusk and reported the meeting to Richard Helms (Director of Intelligence) and Allen Dulles. 9 The substance of the Amory-Rusk meeting is not described in Amory's report, except for noting that they discussed the NBER project on Soviet growth. Cutler pointedly suggested to Rusk that he consider Amory's input on the NBER project, so it seems likely that the conversation was crucial for Nutter's appointment since Amory was Nutter's direct supervisor at the CIA. It would be an extraordinary coincidence for Nutter to be selected as director if Amory, his boss at the CIA, made no mention of Nutter as a candidate for the job in his outreach to the Rockefeller Foundation.</p><p>At least one individual far from the halls of power in Washington also actively promoted Nutter  <ref type="bibr">(Kohli 2001a</ref><ref type="bibr">(Kohli , 2001b))</ref>. Goldman shared the BLS's research on input-output matrices with ORR and provided further connections to input-output experts in the Bureau of the Budget. 18 In December ORR representatives met with Marvin Hoffenberg, another BLS researcher, 19 who was working with his colleague W. Duane Evans on the 1947 US input-output tables <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Evans and Hoffenberg, 1952)</ref>. The day after the meeting with Hoffenberg, Horton followed up with ORR again to share documents from Project SCOOP, the Air Force's inputoutput study. 20 It is unclear whether Nutter himself participated in this flurry of meetings because the names of the ORR representatives are redacted.</p><p>It is not surprising that the CIA pursued input-output modeling expertise inside the federal government, rather than in academia. Input-output modeling was an exciting new avenue of inquiry, but by the early 1950s Leontief "split from the profession," in the words of Vincent <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Carret (2022)</ref> and harbored a "bitterness" over the critical reception of his work. Much of this bitterness came from heated methodological arguments with econometricians at the Cowles Commission <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Biddle, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Carret, 2022)</ref>. Nutter provides no indication of where he learned input-output methods or even how adept he was personally with those methods. Considering that he did not draw on Leontief for his dissertation on monopoly power and the chilly reception of output modeling on the job, at the CIA. Max Millikan's leadership of economic intelligence in ORR "propelled its ascent to the status of a major source of intelligence analysis to the US government" (Zelikow, 1997, p. 167). But even though the CIA was a rising star in the federal firmament, intelligence was always an interagency effort. Economic intelligence was overseen by the EIC, which was composed of representatives from agencies active in the intelligence community (e.g., the CIA, State Department, and the armed services), and non-intelligence agencies with critical subject matter expertise (e.g., the Department of Labor and Department of Agriculture). The work of the EIC was done by its permanent subcommittees and various ad hoc working groups for particular projects (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</p><p>By April, 1952, Nutter was appointed chairman of the Economic Analysis Subcommittee of the EIC, beating out Herbert Block of the State Department, who had initially been suggested for the job. 21 The Economic Analysis Subcommittee was responsible for applying "fairly advanced analytical tools and techniques of economic theory, including input-output analysis, national income accounting, the construction of index numbers, price and cost theory, and the like." 22   Nutter was still serving as chairman of the subcommittee in October, 1952, but he was listed only as a consultant to the CIA, indicating an end to his direct employment. The timing is not surprising: his transition to consultant coincides with a new academic year at Yale. 23 Apparently, in the years after Nutter's return to academia it was not generally known that he had worked for the CIA. William <ref type="bibr">Stauffer's (1956, 61)</ref> history of the UVA Economics Department notes only that Nutter was a "Division Chief with the Federal Government."</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. The Capabilities Study, NIE-59, and NIE-65</head><p>Nutter served as Special Assistant to Max Millikan as early as August, 1951, and was presumably involved in many of Millikan's institution-building efforts that summer, but his first documented project began in the fall of 1951: an inter-industry study of the structure of the Soviet economy, Project 110-51. The purpose of Project 110-51 was to assess the Soviets' economic capability to wage a general, so it was often referred to as the "Capabilities Study."</p><p>The Capabilities Study originated with a request from the Joint Intelligence Committee (JIC), which was the intelligence arm of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and served immediate Cold War intelligence needs concerning "the timing of full mobilization in the Soviet Bloc." 24 Early JIC guidance for Project 110-51 did not request input-output methods, but did call for estimates of "peacetime and wartime military production requirements" and "allocations of basic materials and industrial production to the civilian and military economies." 25 This could have come in the form of a materials balances analysis, but input-output analysis was chosen.</p><p>The documentary record on the Capabilities Study is clearest during its first three months, thanks to a three-page report from Nutter to Max Millikan recounting the initial problems that confronted the study team. 26 According to Nutter, the Capabilities Study was already starting to go off the rails before the end of the year. It was meant to be completed within five months, but an entire month passed before the EIC was even officially charged with the project. After receiving the request, the EIC began coordinating with its military counterparts and outlining the study. Problems with the military emerged quickly. Nutter reported that the military treated the initial directives "as the Bible for its part of the study and refused to deviate in any way from the format laid down without 'orders' to do so from the JIG [Joint Intelligence Group]." In mid-November the military refused to accept an edited outline of the study or take responsibility for "drawing up a list of military end-items" for the input-output analysis. 27 Estimates from the various branches of ORR were straightforward to obtain compared to these military contributions because ORR analysts reported to Millikan (and after his departure, to Amory), but Millikan and Amory had no direct control over the military. By late November Nutter reported that the military "had made no progress in its two jobs and had given up on both." Early December saw "the military prepared, and indeed happy, to abandon the whole project." 28   Ten years to the day after the attack on Pearl Harbor, on "7 December, that memorable date,"</p><p>Nutter met with military representatives in what he described as "an attempt to revive the apparent corpse." One proposal to scale back the Capabilities Study "was beaten down," and the decision was made "to push ahead on the study as newly conceived and make the best of it possible." 29 To regain control of the project, Nutter insisted that any suggested changes flow 25 "Memorandum for the Chairman, Intelligence Advisory Committee."

December 19, 1951, CIA-RDP75-00662R000100190036-5. This is one of the most significant pieces of evidence where Nutter's name is redacted, along with Millikan's. The report is addressed from the Acting Chief of the Economic Capabilities branch ("A/EC/RR") to the Assistant Director of Research and Reports ("AD/RR"), that is, from Nutter to Millikan. 27 Nutter eventually requested the JIG direct the military to produce their components: The Economic Capabilities of The Soviet Bloc to Support a General War.

Millikan overruled him on this, warning that a partial publication would be interpreted as a final product by the Joint</p><p>Chiefs, and that it was better to wait for a complete study. The timeline for the Capabilities Study was rescoped in January, 1952, so that contributions were due to the subcommittee in March.</p><p>Nutter was put in charge of drafting the report in March and April, and then it would be sent through production. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_6">31</ref> This revised timeline was not met either. The Capabilities Study would not be sent through production until December, 1952.</p><p>Nutter was not just a project manager on the Capabilities Study, he was also engaged in the finer analytic details of the project. For example, shortly after his December 7 th meeting with the military "to revive the apparent corpse," Nutter met with the Ferrous Metals Branch of the EIC Materials Division to discuss whether the Soviet steel industry's outputs would be reported in units of rolled or raw steel. Raw steel was determined to be the most appropriate because steel consumed in industry was made from both blooms and billets, and in some cases ingots of steel, making it easier to convert all inputs into their raw steel equivalents. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_7">32</ref>  RAND input-output study is often considered to be a failure in the historical literature. It "was rarely cited and did not become a significant part of the growing literature on economic Sovietology" <ref type="bibr">(Engerman, 2009, p. 108)</ref> Industries" as a producing and consuming industry in their matrixan endogenous agent in the economyand not as an exogenous source of final demand during a war. For Nutter, the whole point of the matrix was to model the impact of exogenous changes in military demand. The Capabilities Study included three distinct Soviet defense sectors ("army," "navy," and "air") as sources of final demand to accommodate multiple alternative war-gaming scenarios. The CIA matrix also included more detail than the RAND matrix in sectors that were well represented among the EIC subcommittees. Where the RAND matrix reported on "chemicals" only, the CIA matrix had entries for refined benzol, toluol, and phenol. RAND's "non-ferrous metals" entry was broken out into copper and aluminum in the CIA matrix. The CIA had more industrial equipment detail as well, including separate rows for generators, ball and roller bearings, machine tools, and electron tubes. Although the CIA produced detailed accounting in several industries, surpassing what was available to Kaplan, it failed to incorporate a few industries that RAND had, including timber and paper products.</p><p>The CIA matrix had clear technical advantages over Kaplan's matrix as well.</p><p>It was an open economy matrix, including imports and exports, and it also captured inventory depletions and accretions. By almost every measure the CIA matrix was superior to its RAND counterpart, with the exception that Kaplan's matrix was expressed in rubles, a step that Nutter's team had not taken. There was no practical obstacle preventing Nutter from denominating in rubles instead of physical units. A 1952 CIA procedural document indicates that Nutter's branch had "some 70 price lists, mostly 1949 and 1950 prices" at its disposal, <ref type="foot" target="#foot_9">43</ref> and was soliciting more price lists from other divisions. This should have been sufficient to translate physical units to prices.</p><p>The Capabilities Study remained a working paper and was never published as a national intelligence estimate like NIE-59 or NIE-65. Most of the 237-page working paper was composed of production input tables and use patterns for each of the industries in the coefficient matrix.</p><p>Use patterns furnished the rows of the input-output matrix while input patterns furnished the columns. For most industries, there were also forecasts for sectoral growth, but the discussion of growth received more cursory treatment than the use and input patterns. The Capabilities Study failed to produce a full input-output model or analysis of the Soviet economy, but it did provide the CIA with several analytical tools and a foundation of processed data for future input-output tables. In addition to the supporting tables and analysis, the study featured five interindustry matrices:</p><p>1. A "Consolidated USSR Transactions  <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Treml, 1975)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. "Drawing Heavily on What</head><p>Superficially, the ORR contribution to NIE-65 was most similar to Nutter's industrial growth study for the NBER. NIE-65 required compiling Soviet production data from 1927 to 1952, synthesizing these data into a production index, and forecasting production through 1957. This is the subject of chapters 4 through 7 of Nutter's book, accounting for almost half of the main text.</p><p>Nutter's experience with index number construction for NIE-65, in combination with <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Fabricant's (1940)</ref> research on index numbers, provided an intellectual foundation for the work. Practically every economist studying the Soviet economy was building an index number of some sort in the 1950s, and Nutter dutifully made his contribution to the swelling literature. But more than any other Soviet researcher, Nutter was dissatisfied with the fundamental theoretical problems plaguing index number construction. Some of the problems Nutter struggled with were well known, including reliability of Soviet price data for weighting index components <ref type="bibr">(Nutter, 1962, p. 121</ref>) and the Gerschenkron effect <ref type="bibr">(Nutter, 1962, p. 127)</ref>. One problem that Nutter was uniquely concerned with was the difficulty of measuring growth when the structure of the economy was changing.</p><p>Nutter's work was highly attentive to the effect of structural change on growth empirics and he had clear inspiration on these issues from Leontief. Nutter's famous analogy comparing structural change to the metamorphosis of a butterfly, that "[w]e cannot say how much the caterpillar grows when it changes into a butterfly" <ref type="bibr">(Nutter, 1966, p. 181</ref>) is taken directly from <ref type="bibr">Leontief's (1953)</ref> chapter on structural change and input-output models in Studies in the Structure of the American Economy:</p><p>"Comparing the structure of an economic system in two stages of its historical development sufficiently removed from each other, one might easily find them to be as unlike as a butterfly and a caterpillar. Not only the relations between the separate sectors of the economy, between the various commodities and services, will have changed, but more than that, the commodities and services found in two stages might turn out to be entirely dissimilar." <ref type="bibr">(Leontief, 1953, p. 20)</ref>.</p><p>That Leontief's concerns with analyzing structural change found its way into Nutter's work is no surprise considering Nutter's close study of input-output methods for the ORR Capabilities Study. Input-output models were also an important tool for the ORR contribution to NIE-65 by providing weights for the production indices, 54 and serving as a check on input estimates from military intelligence. 55 Nutter's work with input-output methods at the CIA was complemented by Solomon Fabricant's familiarity with Leontief's work. Fabricant was not confident in inputoutput modeling's potential. He even shared his doubts with Leontief's funders at the Rockefeller Foundation, confiding that Leontief "has produced little and will produce little." 56   Nutter did not comment publicly on input-output modeling, but a UVA colleague recalls that Nutter shared Fabricant's skepticism about whether the input-output methods would be useful for modeling structural change. 57 These concerns from Fabricant and Nutter may explain why the NBER project did not follow NIE-65 in using input-output models to weight growth indices.</p><p>Nutter's use of Leontief's caterpillar and butterfly metaphor goes back to 1957, when he wrote about the Soviet economy going through "radical metamorphoses" <ref type="bibr">(Nutter, 1957a, p. 62)</ref>, and the problem of "measuring how much the caterpillar grows when it turns into a moth" <ref type="bibr">(Nutter, 1958, p. 362)</ref>. In his book the phrase is restated as "we are faced with metamorphosis rather than growth" and that "[i]t is as if we tried to measure how much a caterpillar grows when it turns into a butterfly" <ref type="bibr">(Nutter, 1962, p. 111)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Nutter (1957a)</ref> highlighted several problems posed by structural change for growth indices. First, when an economy goes through structural change and unbalanced growth, the opportunity costs associated with the bundle of goods actually produced (and therefore the weights for the index) changes. The Gerschenkron effect is a special case of this problem as it pertains to pre-industrial base-year weights, but the problem applies to any structural change. Second, even if the growth of each good in the basket is proportional (eliminating the Gerschenkron effect), changes in the structure of opportunity costs will lead to different measured growth rates for different baskets on the same production possibility frontier.</p><p>Finally, structural change introduces new product bias to growth indices.  <ref type="bibr">-65, Soviet War Potential, 1952</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">-1957</ref><ref type="bibr">.

The Soviet growth study was originally planned as an extended, century long history of Russian and Soviet development, much like other extended economic histories produced by the NBER. However, it was quickly abbreviated to focus on the Soviet period, which was more consistent with the work of contemporary Sovietologists. 50 There is a tendency to view Nutter as a voice crying in the wilderness on Soviet growth, but the NBER project required the cooperation of a large team of researchers and support staff over nine years. Overseen by Nutter and Solomon Fabricant, the project involved</figDesc></figure>

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_3"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>the NBER project on Soviet growth, Warren Nutter made important, underappreciated contributions to the study of the Soviet economy at the CIA. As the director of the Economic Capabilities Branch of the ORR and the Chairman of the Economic Analysis Subcommittee of the EIC, Nutter managed some of the most sophisticated economic intelligence work conducted in the federal government in the early 1950s. His research explored the input-output relations of the Soviet economy, Soviet trade with the West, and prospects for future Soviet growth. This early work shaped the rest of Nutter's career. Behind the scenes Robert Amory, Nutter's superior at the CIA, provided input to the Rockefeller Foundation as they were planning to fund the NBER project. Amory may have even recommended Nutter as project director.The CIA's work on the Soviet capacity to wage a general war would soon be rendered obsolete by progress in miliary technology. In a world of ICBMs carrying thermonuclear weapons, total war did not require a fully mobilized economy. This was the motivating insight behind CharlieHitch and Roland McKean's (1960, 15)  seminal book, The Economics of Defense in the Nuclear Age, that "destructive power has become so cheap that wars can be won or economies destroyed before there is time for mobilization." Despite the declining importance of military capabilities studies, the estimates of Soviet industrial capacity could be repurposed to understand Soviet economic prowess in the NBER Soviet growth study.Nutter acknowledged his debt to prior Soviet research, no doubt including the work conducted at the CIA, when he wrote of his NBER work that "[t]his study falls within the stream of expanding knowledge about the Soviet economy, drawing heavily on what has come before"(Nutter, 1962,   p. 10). Nutter's work with Leontief's input-output methods at the CIA had a clear impact on his subsequent approach to the relationship between structural changes in the economy and index number calculation. Nutter never pursued input-output modeling outside of his work on the Capabilities Study in 1951 and 1952, but he repeatedly returned to Leontief's metaphor about the growth of a caterpillar into a butterfly to emphasize the inadequacy of standard index numbers for capturing radical structural changes.The experience working for the CIA also colors standard narratives of Nutter's antagonistic relationship with the agency and with Allen Dulles in the late 1950s and early 1960s. The differences between the findings of the NBER study and the CIA's analysis of Soviet growth were real, although in some cases exaggerated. Nutter's public engagement with Dulles concealed his own familiarity with the CIA estimates, and the frequent intercourse between the CIA and the NBER project. Of course, Nutter was not at liberty to broadcast details about his relationship with the CIA, so these are not grounds for criticizing Nutter himself. However, with CIA records now (partially) opened, we should reassess how we remember the NBER study on Soviet growth and Nutter's own role in early Cold War efforts to understand the capabilities of the Soviet adversary.</figDesc></figure>

The Economic Capabilities Branch depended on the Commerce Department for international trade data for NIE-59, and Commerce's data production was delayed. In January, 1952, Nutter met with Commerce representatives about the delays 33 and laid out provisional plans to proceed with the analysis in the meantime.34 Otherwise, NIE-59 went smoothly.The first report produced as a part of ORR's contribution to NIE-59 was an "analytic framework" for studying "economic warfare as applied to the East-West trade problem."35 The analytic framework begins by cautioning against investing too many intelligence resources in the study of economic warfare because of the relative impotence of that policy tool.36 Most of the rest of the framework dwells on the differences between "economic welfare" and "strategic welfare," and all the difficulties of estimating reductions in Soviet strategic welfare achievable by severing trade. In September, 1952, guided by the analytic framework, the EIC working group An Analytic Framework for a Study of Economic Warfare as Applied to the East-West Trade Problem. March 18, 1952. CIA-RDP79R01012A001800020009-3.36 Mulder's (2022, 296) history of sanctions and economic warfare similarly recounts the tension between analytic determinations that economic warfare had low "efficacy" and the political value of the dramatic "effects" of economic warfare.37 Economic Intelligence Report: Generalized Assessment of Economic Damage to the Soviet Bloc in the Event of a Complete Severance of East-West Trade. August 31, 1953, CIA-RDP92B01090R000300020016-6. The intelligence report was completed in September, 1952, but published as an official Economic Intelligence Report in August, 1953, as a reference document submitted with the National Intelligence Estimate. Study spilled over into the new work on the intelligence estimate. The due date for NIE-65 had to be pushed "at least thirty days" past the original deadline of September 1952 to accommodate repeated delays in the Capabilities Study. When William Bundy received news of these delays in a memorandum from Nutter, he conceded to Director of National Intelligence Estimates Sherman Kent that "my hunch is that there will be more slippage than that, by a good deal." Kent approved the adjustments but insisted that "we've got to hold the line on the 64 papers," a reference to the high priority NIE-64 estimate of Soviet capabilities to launch a war in 1953.39   By the summer of 1952 the interagency headaches were largely resolved and Nutter committed some time to a parallel Soviet input-output effort at the RAND Corporation led by Norman Kaplan. Kaplan made many important contributions to the study of the Soviet economy during his career, but in 1952much like Nutterhe was only getting started in the field. Kaplan was a contemporary of Nutter's in the University of Chicago Economics Department. He was a focused, diligent student who kept copious class notes. His work was based on the 1941 Soviet Plan, and therefore over a decade out of date the moment it was printed. The RAND study was conducted over the course of ten weeks in the summer of 1952 with a staff that fluctuated between five and ten people(Kaplan et al., 1952). Kaplan's final memorandum acknowledges Nutter's consultation on the project, along with other leading lights in the areas of Soviet economics (Abram Bergson and Joseph Kershaw) and input-output modeling (Marvin Hoffenberg and Wassily Leontief).

The intelligence report estimated that the short run cost of trade severance would be approximately 1.3 percent of Soviet GNP, declining to 0.4 percent of GNP over a four-year adjustment period. With these numbers in hand, the EIC working group concluded that trade severance would not substantially affect the Soviets' capacity to wage war. 37 In the spring of 1952, Nutter and the Economic Capabilities Branch began work on the ORR contribution to NIE-65, a national intelligence estimate of Soviet war capabilities projected through 1957. The intelligence estimate was multifaceted and incorporated political, scientific, and military estimates in addition to ORR's economic estimates. Nutter and the Economic Capabilities Branch were responsible for constructing industry-level Soviet growth indices from 1927 to the present and forecasting industrial growth through 1957. Branch analysts expanded the input-output matrices of the Capabilities Study to weight the production indices for NIE-65. 38</p>Since NIE-65 made use of the Capabilities Study's input-output matrices, the delays on the 33 ORR Diary, 18 January, 1952.

Delays in Nutter's Capabilities Study continued to hamper work on NIE-65 into the autumn, as William Bundy had feared. In October, ORR used Kaplan's inputoutput table to weight the NIE-65 industrial production indices, since the Capabilities Study was not yet ready. 42 ORR's reliance on Kaplan's research for NIE-65 highlights the CIA's early dependence on external researchers in combination with agency staff for its fast-paced and under-resourced work.

A third of the NBER project staff identified in Table1were receiving ORR's unclassified studies.61 As early as 1955 the CIA took Nutter's team into account when planning its own research. A 1955 CIA memorandum planning a study on Soviet agriculture noted that Kuznet's NBER study on agriculture was "closely related and possibly partially duplicating" the CIA proposal.62 In 1956 the Medium Machinery Division of ORR evaluated what they called the "NBER Statistical Compilation of Soviet Statistics," presumably a reference to the unpublished volumes of statistical abstracts that were completed in the same year.63 The year after that, Nutter personally sent the Aircraft Branch of the Industrial Division of ORR his estimates of output and inventory of Soviet aircraft to use in their own research.64 CIA analysts produced detailed reconciliations of discrepancies between their statistics and those shared by Nutter. In some cases the analysts concluded in favor of the CIA's numbers, 65 but in other cases they defended Nutter's figures.66   Although not directly related to the NBER project, the ORR Trade Branch assigned an analyst to write a report on Nutter's 1958 comments on foreign aid (presumably a reference to his June, 1958, lecture on economic warfare, which discussed foreign aid in detail).67 These surviving are a clear example of how "[t]he 'intelligence community' came to be part of the 'epistemic community'"(Mueller, 2013, p. 127)  in the early years of the Cold War. These interactions between the CIA and the NBER project obligate us to reassess Nutter's hostile public relationship with his bête noire, Director of Central Intelligence Allen Dulles. Beginning with a highly publicized address to the US Chamber of Commerce in 1958, Dulles delivered a series of alarming public speeches and testimonies warning against the looming threat of Soviet economic power. He claimed for the Soviets that "annual growth over-all has been running between 6 and 7 percent, annual growth of industry between 10 and 12 per cent." 68 Dulles moderated his forecast in his 1959 Joint Economic Committee testimony, which predicted 6 percent output growth and 8-9 percent industrial growth. Despite the moderation of his figures, by that point Dulles had already ignited a highly publicized battle with Nutter and other Soviet researchers over the question of Soviet growth. Not only was Nutter better appraised of the CIA research effort than he let on, he and Dulles were also corresponding amicably during this period. On April 20 th , 1959, at the height of Dulles's alarm-raising efforts, Nutter wrote to compliment the Director of CentralIntelligence on a recent speech on Soviet growth that he made at the Edison Electric Institute Convention. Dulles copied ORR in his gracious reply back to Nutter's letter, presumably because he was aware of Nutter's previous work with the office. 69 well within the bounds of the forecast in NIE-65 that Nutter contributed to, but higher than two subsequent forecasts, on long run Soviet growth. In 1957 and 1958, the NIE forecasts were raised to 6 percent output growth, consistent with Dulles's statements and with NIE-65. Even more significantly, Dulles's JEC testimony on industrial growth falls squarely within the range thatNutter (1959Nutter ( , 1962) )  estimated for the 1950s, all of which are consistent with NIE-65's forecasted industrial output growth as well as the 1958 NIE forecast. Dulles's 1958 claim that industrial growth "has been running" between 10 and 12 percent does come in higher thanNutter's (1962)  estimate, but it is completely in line with the 1958 NIE estimate of industrial growth for1950-1955. 70 In fact, Nutter's 1959 estimate of Soviet industrial growth for 1950-1955 deviates more from his revised 1962 estimate for that period than any of the CIA's estimates do. Nutter's revision was made in response to criticism fromGreenslade and Wallace (1959), who pointed out that his exclusion of military production significantly misrepresented Soviet industrial production.</figDesc><table><row><cell cols="2">misleading if not irrelevant."</cell></row><row><cell>VI.</cell><cell>The CIA, Allen Dulles, and the NBER Project</cell></row><row><cell cols="2">Dulles's public pronouncements are best understood in the context of the CIA's intelligence</cell></row><row><cell cols="2">61 Recipients for ORR Unclassified Studies, July 1, 1960.
