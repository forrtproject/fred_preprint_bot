<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>No conflicts of interest, financial or otherwise, are declared by the authors. languages learnt in both a societal or heritage context (i.e., Urdu) contribute to early reading skills in another language (i.e., English), thereby emphasizing the importance of overall cross-language knowledge at the early stages of learning to read. This study also emphasizes the role of cross-language transfer for facilitating equitable access to early assessment for bilingual populations: Urdu phonological processing skills can be used to identify bilingual children's future English reading abilities, rather than waiting until the child demonstrates adequate English language proficiency for completing traditional English phonological processing assessments.</p></div>

Method: At Timepoint 1 of this longitudinal study, we assessed 154 Urdu-English kindergarten-aged bilinguals in Pakistan (n = 104) and Canada (n = 50) on their Urdu phonological awareness and rapid automatized naming (RAN) skills, via the Urdu Phonological Tele-Assessment Tool (U-PASS). After 1 year at Timepoint 2, we tested their English word and non-word reading accuracy skills at the Grade 1 level. Result: Our hierarchical linear regressions consistently demonstrated cross-language transfer between Urdu phonological awareness and the English word and non-word reading accuracy measures in both Pakistan and Canada. Predictive strength differences were demonstrated between RAN and reading outcomes, based on country-specific contexts. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate that</p></div>

This process is known as cross-language transfer <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Chung et al., 2018)</ref>. Specific to reading outcomes, cross-language transfer occurs when pre-reading skills acquired in one language, such as Urdu, influence reading abilities in the other language, such as English, of bilingual children.</p><p>Theories of cross-language transfer emphasize various contributing factors for transfer of pre-reading skills to reading abilities across languages <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Chung et al., 2018)</ref>. These include home/heritage (L1) and societal/educational (L2) language proficiency (Linguistic Interdependence Framework [LIH], <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Cummins, 1981;</ref><ref type="bibr">Transfer Facilitation Model, Koda, 2008)</ref>, degree of linguistic distance (i.e., phonological and orthographic similarities between the two languages; Contrastive-Typological Framework, <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Lado, 1964;</ref><ref type="bibr">Transfer Facilitation Model, Koda, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr"></ref> Contrastive Analysis Hypothesis <ref type="bibr">[CAH]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Zaretsky, 2016)</ref>, and the type of assessed pre-reading skill (i.e., whether it is a language-general skill, such as phonological processing, that involves shared underlying cognitive processes across the two languages, or a language-specific skill, such as expressive vocabulary, that involves lexical items specific to a language; Common Underlying Cognitive Process, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Geva &amp; Ryan, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr">Transfer Facilitation Model, Koda, 2008)</ref>. Of relevance to the current study is that all of these theories posit that word-level reading involves cognitive and linguistic processes, including meta-linguistic pre-reading skills, that are transferred across languages <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Chung et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Verhoeven et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">Gholamain &amp; Geva, 2008)</ref>.

Rapid automatized naming (RAN) involves serial processing and rapid retrieval of visual stimuli, including orthographic (i.e., print) and associated phonological (i.e., sound) information.

Cross-language transfer effects were also evident for Chinese syllable-level phonological awareness in relation to Dutch word decoding <ref type="bibr">(Yuan et al., 2021)</ref>. Cross-language transfer was observed between different types of orthographic systems (i.e., whether alphabetic or morpho-syllabic) and regardless of the degree of linguistic distance (i.e., the percentage of shared cognates or linguistic structures across languages) across bilingual language combinations <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Gottardo et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Yuan et al., 2021)</ref>. In line with cross-language transfer theories, <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Melby-Lervåg and Lervåg's (2011)</ref> meta-analysis demonstrated moderate associations between heritagelanguage phonological processing and societal-language word-level decoding across linguistically close and distant languages among children from kindergarten to Grade 8. As compared to language-specific orallanguage skills such as vocabulary, phonological processing involves both language and cognition-based components. Cross-language transfer of phonological processing skills for reading outcomes is therefore less dependent on the degree of linguistic distance between bilingual language combinations -as compared to cross-language transfer effects for vocabulary skills <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Melby-Lervåg &amp; Lervåg, 2011)</ref>.

This approach results in delayed pre-reading assessment for up to 3-4 years. As a result, assessment is not provided until the child exhibits significant reading deficits, often in Grades 3-4, and demonstrates sufficient language proficiency to complete standardized English assessments <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Kidder, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr">Education Commission of the States, 2023a;</ref><ref type="bibr">Education Commission of the States, 2023b;</ref><ref type="bibr">National Center on Improving Literacy, 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr">Ontario Human Rights Commission, 2023)</ref>.

Does Urdu phonological processing, as assessed by the U-PASS tool at the kindergarten level, longitudinally predict the future English reading accuracy skills, as assessed at the Grade 1 level, of Urdu-English simultaneous bilingual children in Experiment 1: Pakistan, with an Urdu national/societal-language context (where children are typically exposed to Urdu within the home and wider society, and formally taught to read Urdu within the school system); and in Experiment 2: Canada, with an Urdu heritage-language context (where children are typically exposed to Urdu within the home and, at times, within the context of additional heritagelanguage classes)?</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hypothesis</head><p>We hypothesize that kindergarten Urdu phonological processing skills will predict Grade 1 English reading, in accordance with the interactive framework for cross-language transfer of reading skills <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Chung et al., 2018)</ref> and Central Processing Hypothesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Geva &amp; Wade-Woolley, 1998)</ref>. For example, we anticipate that children who demonstrate higher Urdu phonological processing scores will also demonstrate higher English reading scores. Since the Urdu-English bilinguals in Pakistan would have received greater Urdu exposure, both informally and formally in the home and school due to Urdu's national/societal-language status, we anticipate stronger predictions between Urdu phonological processing and English reading in Pakistan. We expect these findings due to the link between heritage-language proficiency and cross-language transfer to the societallanguage (Linguistic Interdependence Framework [LIH]; <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Cummins, 1981;</ref><ref type="bibr">Transfer Facilitation Model;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Koda, 2008)</ref>. In addition, the quantity and quality of language exposure has been linked to future reading development <ref type="bibr">(Chang &amp; Monaghan, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Lundberg, 2006)</ref>. In comparison, we anticipate comparatively weaker predictions between Urdu phonological processing and English reading for the Canadian bilinguals due to decreased Urdu exposure in a heritage-language context where Urdu is not the dominant societal-language.</p></div>

We assessed 104 children after 1 school year, at timepoint 2 (i.e., at 6-7 years; at the end of Grade 1) in Pakistan, due to attrition of one child at timepoint 2.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure</head><p>After completing the eligibility screening form, parents then completed consent and two child and parental background questionnaires at both timepoint 1 and timepoint 2. The three parental forms took parents approximately 10-15 minutes to complete. Along with the parental consent forms, testers obtained verbal assent from each child and verified video and sound quality, prior to conducting each online assessment session. In line with tele-assessment guidelines <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">(Wood et al., 2021)</ref>, our testing team used Zoom to assess each child on their non-linguistic cognitive skills and Urdu phonological processing skills at timepoint 1, and English word/non-word reading accuracy skills at timepoint 2. Each child completed the experimental measures within 1-2 hours, depending on their attention span, need for breaks, and response rate.</p><p>Each session was 1 hour, and all sessions were completed within a week. All testers completed training and testing simulations prior to conducting assessments. The Urdu phonological processing measure was administered by Urdu native speakers. The testers did not follow standardized basal and stopping rules for Urdu and English oral language and reading tests. As the English tests have been standardized for monolingual English-speaking populations in North-American contexts, we cannot compare the Urdu-English bilinguals in this cross-country study to English monolingual performance norms. We concluded subtest testing when a child did not respond to more than 75% of test items on a page; the tester then proceeded with the subsequent subtest. Testers also noted both non-responses and other incorrect responses on the experimental measures by the participants. See Supplementary Figure S1 for measures at timepoint 1 and timepoint 2 of this longitudinal study. Measures Parent-Completed Questionnaires. Consent Form. See Supplementary Table S2 for the consent form. Child Language Background Questionnaire. The Child Language Experience and Proficiency Questionnaire ([LEAP-Q]; Marian et al., 2007a; Marian et al., 2007b) is a parental report of child language background</p><p>which is used by researchers across multiple disciplines, including speechlanguage pathology, linguistics, education, psychology and neuroscience.</p><p>We adapted and used the LEAP-Q to collect parental reports of age at assessment (in months), gender, age of acquisition (AoA), and language proficiency/dominance (i.e., percentage of exposure and usage) across the Urdu-English bilingual children's two languages. See Supplementary Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">S2</ref> for the child language background questionnaire.</p><p>Parental Demographic Questionnaire. This demographic selfreport questionnaire collects parental demographic, language background and socio-economic status (SES) information. We asked parents to report country-specific indicators of socio-economic status (SES), due to potential influences on child pre-reading and reading outcomes -beyond bilingual experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Meir &amp; Armon-Lotem, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Wood et al., 2018)</ref>. These countryspecific SES indicators include paternal and maternal education levels, occupation, child school tuition rates (for Pakistan), and child school neighbourhood (for Canada). Our questionnaire is similar to questionnaires used by other biliteracy studies (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Mirza et al., 2017)</ref>. See Supplementary Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">S2</ref> for the parental language/demographic background questionnaire.</p><p>Experimental Measures.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Domain-General</head><p>/Non-Linguistic Cognitive Measure. The Matrix Analogies Test-Expanded Form ([MAT-EF]; Naglieri &amp; Insko, 1986) is a language general measure of non-verbal reasoning that is based on visuallypresented pictures and patterns. The MAT-EF includes four subtests, each with 16 items: pattern completion, reasoning by analogy, serial reasoning, and spatial visualization. Urdu Phonological Processing Measure. The open-access Urdu Phonological Tele-Assessment (U-PASS) tool assesses children's ability to recognize, segment, and manipulate presented spoken sound segments. The age-, linguistically-, and culturally-appropriate U-PASS tool has prior demonstrated within-language criterion-based concurrent validity (Bhalloo &amp; Molnar, 2023). In this cross-language transfer study, children were tested and assessed on the phonological awareness (compound-level and phonemelevel sound elision, sound matching, compound-level, syllable-level, and phoneme-level word and non-word blending subtests) and letter and digit rapid automatized naming (RAN) components of the U-PASS tool. The phonological awareness and RAN components were selected due to their clinical relevance and common use by SLPs and educators for school-aged children. The letter and digit RAN subtests were included due to their relevance to word reading (Hornung et al., 2017). See Supplementary Table S2 for the U-PASS tool's visual and audio-based stimuli and scoring form. English Word/Non-Word Reading Accuracy Measures. We tested children's word/non-word reading accuracy skills via two subtests from the Woodcock Reading Mastery Test ([WRMT-III]; Woodcock, 2011). Children were presented with 76 English words (Word Identification subtest) and 44 English non-words (Word Attack subtest), and were scored based on the total number of correct responses. The WRMT-III (Woodcock, 2011) is a norm-referenced standardized measure of word-reading in English. The</p><p>WRMT-III has an established convergent validity (r = 0.9, p&lt;0.01) and internal reliability ranging from r = .91 to r = .98 <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Pae et al., 2005)</ref>. We did not include English reading fluency measures due to English's comparatively opaque orthography. SLPs and educators in North America typically only assess children's English word-level reading accuracy at the Grade 1 level, due to its orthographic depth (i.e., the degree of 1:1 consistency between symbol [i.e., grapheme] -sound [i.e., phoneme] mappings in alphabetic orthographies; these are relatively inconsistent in opaque orthographies compared to transparent orthographies). English word reading fluency is typically mastered and assessed at higher grade levels, such as from Grades 3 -4 and beyond. This is due to inconsistent grapheme -phoneme correspondences (GPCs) in the opaque English orthography, which results in young readers developing phonological decoding (i.e., the ability to recognize and combine individual graphemes, associated with phonemes, to decode and read a written word) and rapid word recognition skills at a later age. In comparison, readers in transparent orthographies, such as Urdu, become accurate and fluent readers at an earlier age, such as at the Grade 1 level, due to consistent GPCs <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Borleffs et al., 2019)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical Methods</head><p>This longitudinal study examines cross-language transfer effects for Urdu phonological processing, specifically phonological awareness and RAN components using the U-PASS tool, in relation to English word and nonword reading accuracy measures. To investigate this, we conducted hierarchical linear regression analyses based on an enter method for variable selection, and a specified statistical significance of p ≤ 0.05 <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Hosmer et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Lemeshow et al., 2011)</ref>. We ensured that the regression analyses met the assumptions of normality, homoscedasticity, multicollinearity, outliers, and independence. We identified outliers, but retained them in our analysis as they did not significantly affect our results.</p><p>In our hierarchical linear regression analyses, we used Cohen's local f 2 as an indicator of effect size specific to our main predictor variable of interest (i.e., in the final Step 4: Urdu phonological awareness, or Urdu RAN; <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Selya et al., 2012)</ref>. We categorized effect sizes in line with <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Cohen's (1988)</ref> guidelines: f 2 ≥ 0.02 (as small effect size), f 2 ≥ 0.15 (as medium effect size), and f 2 ≥ 0.35 (as large effect size). Note. We acknowledge that the interpretation of effect sizes is contextual; however, prior studies in this field have not typically reported effect sizes for hierarchical linear regressions, therefore limiting comparison. It is also important to note that 'small' effect sizes can be 'large' in real-world contexts, such as assessment and cross-language transfer studies with linguistically-distant bilingual language combinations (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Carey et al., 2023)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Predictor Variables</head><p>The predictor variables included in the hierarchical linear regression are: age (in months), gender, socio-economic status (Step 1), domaingeneral cognitive skills (Step 2), Timepoint 1 English proficiency (Step 3), and the target predictor variable Urdu phonological processing as measured by the U-PASS (i.e., phonological awareness and letter, digit RAN subtests;</p><p>Step 4). The control variables in Steps 1-3 were determined based on prior similar studies (see, <ref type="bibr">Bhalloo &amp; Molnar, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Mirza et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr"></ref> see hierarchical linear regression tables below for Steps 1 -4). This allowed us to determine if kindergarten Urdu phonological awareness and RAN scores contribute unique variance to Grade 1 English reading accuracy, above demographic and language dominance factors included in prior crosslanguage studies (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Durgunoğlu, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Lafrance &amp; Gottardo, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Ramirez et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Deacon et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Pasquarella et al., 2015)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dependent Variables</head><p>The predictor variables in Steps 1 -4 were analyzed in relation to two dependent variables: (1) English word reading accuracy and (2) English non-word reading accuracy (see hierarchical linear regression tables below for Steps 1 -4). We did so to determine if kindergarten-level Urdu phonological processing contributes unique variance to Grade 1 English reading, above the influence of demographic and language dominance factors.</p></div>

In Supplementary Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">S3</ref>, we present correlations for the nonlinguistic cognitive, Urdu phonological awareness, Urdu RAN, and English reading accuracy experimental measures included in our statistical analyses in Pakistan. In the correlation matrix, we found moderate-strong level correlations between Timepoint 1 Urdu phonological awareness and Timepoint 2 English word and non-word reading accuracy measures in Pakistan (ranging from r = 0.43 to r = 0.47). Low-level correlations were evident for the Timepoint 1 Urdu RAN and the Timepoint 2 English word and non-word reading accuracy measures (ranging from r = 0.10 to r = 0.15).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cross-Language Transfer Effects for Urdu Phonological Processing and English Reading in Pakistan</head><p>We present hierarchical linear regression analyses separate by country, as we seek to investigate cross-language transfer effects for kindergarten-level Urdu phonological processing in relation to the future Grade 1 English reading accuracy skills of Urdu-English bilingual children, in both a national/societal-language (i.e., Pakistan; Experiment 1) and heritage-language context (i.e., Canada; Experiment 2). As well, the interaction terms for Urdu phonological awareness and RAN were significant across most reading measures. Supplementary tables S4 -S7</p><p>indicate the interaction terms for Urdu phonological awareness and RAN in relation to reading for Pakistan and Canada. Specifically, we investigated cross-language transfer effects for the Urdu phonological awareness and RAN components of the U-PASS tool across the English word reading accuracy and non-word reading accuracy outcome measures. We present these analyses for Pakistan, below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Urdu Phonological Awareness and English Word Reading Accuracy</head><p>Supplementary Table <ref type="table">S8</ref> presents the hierarchical linear regression for Timepoint 1 Urdu phonological awareness, with Timepoint 2 English word reading accuracy as the outcome variable (see Supplementary Figure S9, Experiment 1 for scatterplot). The main purpose of this regression was to examine whether Urdu phonological awareness longitudinally predicts English word reading accuracy in Pakistan. The predictor variable of interest (entered in the last step), Urdu phonological awareness, accounted for 3% of the variance in English word reading accuracy (F (1, 97] = 5.92, p &lt; 0.05; Cohen's local f 2 = 0.06). The final beta weights indicate that only age at assessment (t = 2.10, p &lt;0.05), SES (t = 2.09, p &lt;0.05), nonlinguistic cognitive skills (t = 4.20, p &lt;0.001), and Urdu phonological awareness (t = 2.43, p &lt;0.05) were significant independent predictors of English word reading accuracy. Urdu Phonological Awareness and English Non-Word Reading Accuracy Supplementary Table S10 indicates the hierarchical linear regression for Timepoint 1 Urdu phonological awareness, with Timepoint 2 English word non-reading accuracy as the outcome variable (see Supplementary Figure S11, Experiment 1 for scatterplot). The purpose of this regression was to examine whether Urdu phonological awareness longitudinally predicts English non-word reading accuracy in Pakistan. The predictor variable of interest (entered in step 4), Urdu phonological awareness, accounted for 6% of the variance in English non-word reading accuracy (F (1, 97] = 9.70, p &lt; 0.01; Cohen's local f 2 = 0.10). As revealed by the final beta weight, only non-linguistic cognitive skills (t = 3.26, p &lt;0.01) and Urdu phonological awareness (t = 3.11, p &lt;0.01) were unique predictors of English non-word reading accuracy. Urdu RAN and English Word Reading Accuracy As shown in Supplementary Table S12, we present the hierarchical linear regression for Timepoint 1 Urdu RAN in relation to Timepoint 2 English word reading accuracy as the outcome variable (see Supplementary Figure S13, Experiment 1 for associated scatterplot). The primary purpose of this regression was to examine whether Urdu RAN longitudinally predicts English word reading accuracy in Pakistan. Urdu RAN accounted for 5% of the variance in English word reading accuracy (F (1, 43] = 8.92, p &lt; 0.01; Cohen's local f 2 = 0.09). The final beta weights indicate that only age (t = 3.39, p &lt;0.01), the non-linguistic cognitive measure (t = 6.07, p &lt;0.001), Timepoint 1 English Language Proficiency (t = 2.26, p &lt;0.05), and Urdu RAN (t = 2.98, p &lt;0.01) were unique predictors of English word reading accuracy. Urdu RAN and English Non-Word Reading Accuracy Supplementary Table S14 presents the hierarchical linear regression for Timepoint 1 Urdu RAN, with Timepoint 2 English non-word reading accuracy as the outcome variable (see Supplementary Figure S15, Experiment 1 for scatterplot). The main purpose of this regression was to examine whether Urdu RAN longitudinally predicts English non-word reading accuracy in Pakistan. The predictor variable of interest (entered in the fourth step), Urdu RAN, accounted for 3% of the variance in English non-word reading accuracy (F (1, 97] = 5.00, p &lt; 0.05; Cohen's local f 2 = 0.05). The final beta weights indicate that only age (t = 2.85, p &lt;0.01), nonlinguistic cognitive skills (t = 5.03, p &lt;0.001), Timepoint 1 English Language Proficiency (t = 2.03, p &lt;0.05), and Urdu RAN (t = 2.23, p &lt;0.05)</p><p>uniquely predicted English non-word reading accuracy.</p><p>Experiment 2: Canada</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p>Our study is amongst the few studies to longitudinally examine crosslanguage transfer effects for Indo-Aryan languages, such as Urdu <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Mirza &amp; Gottardo, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Mirza &amp; Gottardo, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Mirza et al., 2017)</ref>. We tested phonological processing skills -particularly, phonological awareness and RAN -and English word-level reading across two diverse country contexts.</p><p>In the upcoming sections, we also discuss the clinical and research implications of our cross-language transfer findings for Urdu-English bilingual children in both Pakistan and Canada, as well as for bilingual readers of English who also speak a heritage-language that is linguistically related to Urdu globally.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cross-Language Transfer Effects: Common Findings Across Pakistan and Canada</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Urdu Phonological Awareness and English Reading</head><p>Across Canada and Pakistan, Urdu phonological awareness consistently contributed to English word and non-word reading accuracy. In general, our cross-language transfer findings are in line with prior studies investigating the relationship between meta-linguistic skills and reading ability in linguistically-distant languages (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Melby-Lervåg &amp; Lervåg, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Schwartz et al., 2007)</ref>. Across our correlation matrix and hierarchical linear regression analyses for Pakistan and Canada, we found stronger predictions between Urdu phonological awareness and English non-word reading, as compared to the word reading measures in both Pakistan (word reading accuracy: 3% variance; non-word reading accuracy: 6% variance)</p><p>and Canada (word reading accuracy: 13% variance; non-word reading accuracy: 18% variance). These findings emphasize the importance of phonological awareness for forming grapheme -phoneme correspondences (GPCs) and using phonological decoding strategies to identify/sound out individual graphemes and blend together their associated phonemes to read unfamiliar non-words <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Swank &amp; Catts, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Hogan et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Powell &amp; Atkinson, 2021)</ref>. Comparatively, children will usually utilize a combination of phonological decoding (which involves phonological awareness) and sight-word (which primarily involves processing speed and memory) reading strategies to read words, depending on their reading experience as well as lexical familiarity and consolidation of familiar words within long-term memory <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Ehri, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Ehri, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Ehri, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Miles &amp; Ehri, 2019)</ref>.</p><p>Overall, our analyses demonstrated cross-language transfer of Urdu phonological awareness for English word and non-word reading accuracy in Urdu-English simultaneous bilinguals across two country contexts.</p><p>Bilinguals are a heterogeneous group, and are commonly categorized in terms of their age of acquisition (AoA), language proficiency, and the duration, quality, and interactional contexts/environments for language exposure and usage. In this study, we accounted for AoA and language proficiency across both languages by assessing simultaneous bilinguals (i.e.,</p><p>with AoA between 0 -3 years), while examining transfer in one source of variance in the bilingual language experience: two countries, with differences in Urdu-language status and exposure/usage contexts. By doing so, we enhanced the generalizability of our findings to bilinguals in diverse linguistic contexts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Urdu Letter &amp; Digit RAN and English Reading</head><p>Our analyses also examined the longitudinal relationship between Urdu RAN and English word and non-word reading accuracy. We included letter and digit RAN due to their links to word reading, in terms of the retrieval of print-related stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Hornung et al., 2017)</ref>. Across our correlation matrix and hierarchical linear regressions in the two countries, we generally found stronger associations between Urdu phonological awareness and English reading accuracy, compared to RAN. In Pakistan, Urdu RAN contributed to 5% and 6% of the variance in English word and non-word reading accuracy (ranging from r = 0.10 to r = 0.15, p &lt; 0.05),</p><p>with RAN contributing to 3% of the variance in English word reading accuracy in Canada (r = 0.27, p &lt; 0.05). RAN was not a significant predictor of non-word reading accuracy in Canada (see Country-Specific Findings section below for further discussion).</p><p>RAN supports retrieval of phonological and orthographic information stored in long-term memory, such as acquired symbol-sound mappings, word units and whole words, during later fluent word recognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Catts, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Papadopoulos et al., 2016)</ref>. Fluent word recognition, which relies on whole-word reading strategies, involves a speed-of-processing component similar to RAN. This language-general cognitive process forms one of the hypothesized theoretical bases of the RAN-reading fluency relationship, and may be the reason why RAN was not as strongly associated with the reading accuracy measures in this study -as compared to phonological awareness <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Georgiou et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Papadopoulos et al., 2016)</ref>. In general, we found that phonological awareness was a more reliable predictor of early word/nonword reading accuracy, which is likely due to the task requiring awareness of phonological units and effortful decoding of individual GPCs. RAN did not seem to be a sensitive indicator of word and non-word reading accuracy in this cross-language study. Our findings also reflect prior studies which highlight that RAN -while a contributor to reading accuracy -is more strongly associated with reading fluency measures, even when examined in relation to reading outcomes in the same language <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Landerl et al., 2019)</ref>. phonological decoding strategies at an earlier age and were using comparatively more whole-word reading strategies, with a speed-ofprocessing component similar to that used in RAN tasks, to recognize and retrieve familiar whole words and word segments during the reading tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Ehri, 2017)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Country-Specific</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Canada</head><p>The use of phonological decoding, as compared to whole-word, reading strategies at the Grade 1 level may explain the low-level and nonsignificant relationships between RAN and the reading accuracy measures in Canada. Children in Canada typically receive consistent reading instruction at the Grade 1 level across schools <ref type="bibr">(Ontario Curriculum and Resources, 2023)</ref>. Due to this later age at first reading exposure, the Canadian bilinguals may still be forming GPCs and had to decode each individual grapheme to sound out the formed word during reading, instead of using the whole-word retrieval strategies that also underlie RAN tasks.</p><p>The low-level and non-significant RAN-reading relationship patterns for the Canadian bilinguals could also be due to power and sample size limitations, </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Country Differences</head><p>While the main purpose of this study was to investigate crosslanguage transfer between Urdu phonological processing and English reading in two countries, we also conducted preliminary examination of country-level differences. In our hierarchical analysis for phonological awareness, phonological awareness emerged as the only unique predictor of word and non-word reading accuracy for the Canadian bilinguals. There were also stronger predictions between Urdu phonological awareness and reading accuracy skills in Canada (word reading accuracy: 13% variance; non-word reading accuracy: 18% variance), as compared to Pakistan (word reading accuracy: 3% variance; non-word reading accuracy: 6% variance).</p><p>The cross-country predictive strength differences in our hierarchical linear regressions may potentially be due to differences in language status and exposure/usage rates across the two contexts.</p><p>Given that heritage-language proficiency influences cross-language transfer to the societal-language (Linguistic Interdependence Framework</p><p>[LIH]; <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Cummins, 1981;</ref><ref type="bibr">Transfer Facilitation Model;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Koda, 2008)</ref>, we expected the opposite pattern in line with our hypothesis: Stronger predictions between Urdu phonological processing and English reading in Pakistan. This is because the quantity and quality of language exposure has been linked to future reading development <ref type="bibr">(Chang &amp; Monaghan, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Lundberg, 2006)</ref>. The Urdu-English bilinguals in both Canada and Pakistan received English schooling instruction. However, parents reported greater mean Urdu language exposure and usage within the home and school environments in Pakistan (Urdu proficiency: 73.90%; English proficiency: 26.10) compared to Canada (Urdu proficiency: 51.51%; English proficiency: 48.49), thereby reflecting Urdu's status as the national/societal language in Pakistan. In addition, the Urdu-English bilinguals in Pakistan demonstrated higher mean scores on the Urdu phonological awareness (Pakistan: 101.34; Canada: 88.98) and RAN (Pakistan: 59.27; Canada: 28.28) measures.</p><p>We also explored whether English language proficiency and reading abilities contributed to these cross-country predictive strength differences.</p><p>It could be that the higher parent-reported mean English usage and exposure rates in Canada (Pakistan: 26.10%; Canada: 48.49%) influenced English reading abilities, and mediated the comparatively stronger predictive relationship between Urdu phonological processing and English reading skills in Canada. However, our t-tests for country differences in English word and non-word reading accuracy were not significant, and children demonstrated marginal score differences between Pakistan and Canada (Word Reading Accuracy: Pakistan: 48.87; Canada: 55.26; Non-Word Reading Accuracy: Pakistan: 24.42; Canada: 24.52). We could not further explore the basis of the demonstrated cross-country differences due to sample size differences across the two countries.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Clinical and Research Implications</head><p>Our cross-language transfer findings highlight how the heritagelanguage can support development of reading skills in the educational/societal language of bilingual children. Bilingual children's heritage-language pre-reading skills were indicative of their societallanguage reading skills, as demonstrated by our cross-language transfer findings with Urdu phonological processing in relation to English reading.</p><p>Similarly, in other studies, kindergarten-level phonological processing skills have been shown to transfer and are indicative of future Grade 1 wordreading development across languages <ref type="bibr">(Bhalloo &amp; Molnar, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Melby-Lervåg &amp; Lervåg, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Schwartz et al., 2007)</ref>. As such, speech-language pathologists and educators can use heritage-language reading precursor assessment tools, such as our Urdu Phonological Tele-Assessment (U-PASS) tool, to examine and assess future reading abilities in the societal-language.</p><p>Clinicians can identify and support bilingual children's future reading skills in the language of education (i.e., English), via established heritagelanguage phonological processing skills.</p><p>For simultaneous bilinguals, with similar age of acquisition (AoA) and near-equal proficiency, linguistically-appropriate tools enable comprehensive assessment of reading milestones across the two languages. Our U-PASS tool <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bhalloo &amp; Molnar, 2023)</ref> has the potential to enable clinicians to screen for and mitigate future reading and resulting academic difficulties in the language of education (i.e., English), via phonological processing skills in the dominant heritage-language -without English language proficiency confounds. While our study demonstrated cross-language transfer effects for simultaneous Urdu-English bilinguals with near-equal age of acquisition and proficiency in both languages, we also anticipate generalizability of our cross-language transfer findings to sequential bilinguals and second language learners with greater Urdulanguage dominance. We expect these findings in line with other studies that have demonstrated cross-language transfer of reading skills in children with diverse language dominance profiles <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Chen et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Durgunoğlu, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Chung et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>For sequential bilingual children and second language learners with comparatively less proficiency in the language of education (which is typically English), heritage-language phonological assessment tools, such as the U-PASS tool, may be a reliable alternative to delaying pre-reading assessment until sufficient English proficiency has been gained for assessment purposes. Due to their limited English proficiency, these bilingual children will benefit from cross-language assessments that use the dominant heritage-language to identify and support their future English reading abilities. By examining Urdu phonological processing skills, SLPs can facilitate early support of English reading skills in children with limited English language proficiency, who are unable to otherwise access early pre-reading assessment and, in turn, intervention. Our findings are also relevant to emerging readers who are developing their English reading skills, and can speak a heritage-language phonologically or orthographically related to Urdu, such as Arabic and Persian. Similar to Urdu, these languages are commonly spoken globally <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Eberhard et al., 2021)</ref> -but under-investigated in speech-language and reading research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations</head><p>While our sample size is in line with biliteracy studies <ref type="bibr">(O'Brien at al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Mirza et al., 2017)</ref>, sample size differences emerged across Pakistan and Canada as a result of voluntary sampling methods. The larger sample size for Urdu-English bilinguals in Pakistan is representative of Urdu's status as a national/societal language, which facilitated participant recruitment. Urdu, although in the top-10 most spoken heritage-languages, is a minoritized language in Canada <ref type="bibr">(Statistics Canada, 2011b;</ref><ref type="bibr">Statistics Canada, 2016)</ref>. Another sample-related limitation is that our eligibility criteria included Urdu-English simultaneous bilinguals from mid-high socioeconomic status (SES) background across Canada and Pakistan. While this can limit the current cross-language transfer study's generalizability, we had to consider existing structural inequities such as that access to reliable internet and English-medium schools is linked to SES in Pakistan. However, while a limitation, this resulted in our participants having generally similar demographic and language backgrounds across the countries of assessment. Other limitations include the length of assessment and increased distraction for young children engaging in tele-assessments, for which we ensured multiple short sessions and breaks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Future Directions</head><p>By examining cross-language transfer in two country contexts with differences in Urdu-language status and interactional (i.e., exposure and usage) contexts, this study investigated one source of heterogeneity in the bilingual language experience. To examine cross-language transfer across diverse linguistic contexts, our future research aims to assess diverse Urduspeaking language populations across socio-economic status, language dominance profiles (as indicated by AoA and language proficiency), and demographic backgrounds. Some accessibility strategies include facilitating access to internet vouchers and transport with community centers with Wi-Fi access in country contexts with technological limitations. This will also allow us to examine cross-language transfer effects for Urdu phonological processing in relation to other societal languages beyond English and in other national/societal and heritage-language contexts. Extending this study to diverse Urdu-language country contexts, such as Fiji and the Middle-East, will enable us to compare cross-language transfer effects for Urdu phonological processing in relation to reading in both linguistically-distant languages such as English and linguistically-close languages such as Arabic and Persian.</p><p>To comprehensively investigate contributions of phonological processing components across reading outcomes, our future directions include examining longitudinal cross-language transfer effects for phonological awareness and RAN in relation to word/non-word reading accuracy and fluency measures across both the heritage and societal languages. While examining reciprocal cross-language transfer effects (i.e., between English phonological processing and Urdu reading) was beyond our current study's scope, we will examine transfer between both heritagelanguage and societal-language pre-reading and reading skills in a future study. As well, including fluency measures will allow us to examine the differential age-related contributions of the two phonological processing components based on the type of assessed reading outcome measure.</p><p>We did not include reading fluency measures in the current study, as we only assessed English reading ability. SLPs and educators commonly only assess reading accuracy in English at the Grade 1 level, with fluency being assessed at the Grade 2 -3 levels. This is due to the language's opaque orthography which results in acquisition of GPCs and, in turn, accurate and fluent reading at a later age than readers in transparent orthographies <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Álvarez-Cañizo et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Borleffs et al., 2019)</ref>. Our future study will examine reciprocal cross-language effects of phonological awareness and RAN influences on word and non-word reading accuracy and fluency across multiple grade levels, to allow for a more comprehensive examination. This is because RAN may play a comparatively greater role in facilitating reading abilities as children become experienced and fluent readers at higher grade levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Ehri, 2017)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>Our study contributes to research in Urdu, an under-investigated yet commonly spoken language. Our cross-language transfer findings highlight the importance of the heritage-language (i.e., Urdu) for facilitating access to pre-reading assessment in typically-developing Urdu-speaking bilingual children, and promoting reading development in the societal languagethereby reducing assessment wait times for children who cannot be assessed in the societal/educational language (i.e., English). Overall, our study contributes to linguistic diversity in reading research and has clinical implications for promoting equitable access to pre-reading assessment for all children -regardless of language proficiency and background. A future study will examine the clinical implications of cross-language transfer in children identified as at-risk for reading difficulties.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Findings: Cross-Language Transfer of RAN Pakistan Urdu RAN significantly predicted English word and non-word reading accuracy in Pakistan.
