<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Enhancing tourist satisfaction is the key to sustainable tourism in protected areas.

Responses from 1,175 participants were included in the final analysis. We found that tourist satisfaction generally increased with the distance from tourists' residential areas to destinations. Additionally, tourists who were aware that the destination was situated within a designated national park reported a higher level of satisfaction. Increasing the awareness regarding national parks and the associated knowledge input from visual, verbal, and sensory stimuli can thus increase tourist satisfaction and improve economic circulation in rural areas through increased tourism from outside the region. We also demonstrated that the effect of protection level on tourist satisfaction varies according to the destination group with different motivations for visiting. Our study underscores the importance of tailoring management strategies to address the unique requirements of different destinations within a park, thereby facilitating tourist satisfaction and experience.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Impact statement</head><p>Enhancing tourist satisfaction is crucial for sustainable tourism in protected areas. Our destination-specific analysis of major national parks in Japan revealed that satisfaction generally increases with the distance from tourist residential areas to destinations. Additionally, tourists who are aware of a destination's designation within a national park have higher satisfaction levels. By increasing the awareness of these parks and providing diverse knowledge inputs, such as visual, verbal, and sensory stimuli, we can bolster tourist satisfaction and stimulate economic growth in rural areas through increased tourism from beyond the region. Moreover, our findings highlight the nuanced impact of protection levels on satisfaction, contingent on the diverse motivations of destination groups. Thus, tailoring management strategies to cater to the distinct needs of various destinations within a park is critical for enhancing tourist satisfaction and overall experience.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Ecotourism, defined as responsible travel to natural areas that conserves the environment while enhancing the well-being of local people, has emerged as a significant force in the tourism industry <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Balmford et al., 2009)</ref>. With the rising demand for nature-based experiences, tourism utilizing natural resources has considerably risen in recent years, fostering economic benefits such as employment and income in surrounding regions <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Ardoin et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Protected areas (PAs) are central to the conservation of natural ecosystems and promotion of sustainable tourism. A PA is outlined as "a clearly defined geographical space, recognized, dedicated and managed, through legal or other effective means, to achieve the long-term conservation of nature with associated ecosystems services and cultural values" <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Dudley, 2008)</ref>.</p><p>PAs, which cover 15.4% of the Earth's land and inland water areas and 3.4% of the oceans <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Juffe-Bignoli et al., 2014)</ref>, serve to prevent deforestation and mitigate habitat loss and species decline.</p><p>Moreover, they actively provide valuable recreational spaces for people wanting to engage with nature and offer a wide range of ecosystem services, including cultural ones.</p><p>Efforts to balance conservation imperatives with tourism utilization within PAs have led to the implementation of various management strategies, including visitor regulations and zoning schemes <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Fennell, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Pearce &amp; Dowling, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr"></ref> https://www.env.go.jp/park/about/protect/entry.html, 24/01/2024). However, challenges persist, such as the environmental impacts of excessive tourist visitations and funding resource constraints faced by PA management <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Dodds &amp; Butler, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Hoffmann &amp; Sven Schmeller, 2021)</ref>. Addressing these challenges is essential to ensure the sustainable utilization of PAs for ecotourism purposes <ref type="bibr">(World Tourism Organization, 2004)</ref>.</p><p>Enhancing tourist satisfaction is the key to sustainable tourism within PAs <ref type="bibr">(World Tourism Organization, 2004)</ref>, reflecting the alignment between tourists' expectations and experiences <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Oliver, 1980)</ref>. High levels of satisfaction are associated with positive tourist behaviors, including loyalty to destinations and engagement in conservation efforts such as contributions to conservation funds, voluntary management, and environmentally responsible behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Ramkissoon et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Yoon &amp; Uysal, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Žabkar et al., 2010)</ref>. Thus, understanding tourist satisfaction is critical to ensure support for PA conservation and management <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Carvache-Franco et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Chiu et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Li et al., 2021)</ref> Tourist satisfaction depends on several factors, including individual motivations for visiting a specific place and interacting with nature, demographic attributes, prior knowledge sources, accessibility, and naturalness of the destination area <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Marasinghe et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Oviedo-García et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Río-Rama et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Zhang et al., 2020)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Oviedo-García et al. (2017)</ref> found that prior knowledge of tourists such as their experiences with the destination and other visual, verbal, and sensory stimuli (including advertisements, articles, and television programming) can affect satisfaction. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Mutanga et al. (2017)</ref> demonstrated that different motivational factors influence satisfaction with wildlife tourism differently.</p><p>Most previous studies have used on-site or online structured questionnaires to explore the determinants of tourist satisfaction with their visit to entire PAs or their overall trips <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Ibrahim et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Otsuka et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Romão et al., 2014)</ref>. However, few studies have explicitly focused on specific tourist destinations within PAs and conducted a destination-level analysis to examine how tourist satisfaction varies according to their motivation for visiting, demographic attributes, prior knowledge sources, accessibility, and naturalness of destination areas. For example, "light" tourists who mainly visit common tourist spots and enjoy landscapes may be satisfied with wellmanaged infrastructure and facilities, whereas "core" tourists who mainly visit spots with high naturalness and prefer activities that involve close interactions with nature such as mountain trekking may seek well-conserved pristine nature areas. Tourist motivations and associated satisfaction levels may thus vary depending on the destination within the PA. Therefore, conducting site-specific analyses is crucial to better understand visitors' demands and satisfaction.</p><p>In Japan, national parks serve as vital tourism assets, and there is a growing emphasis on enhancing tourist satisfaction within these areas. Recognizing the importance of national parks in the tourism sector, initiatives such as the "Project to Fully Enjoy National Parks" (https://www.env.go.jp/nature/mankitsu-project/, retrieved 01/02/2024) have been implemented.</p><p>This project aims to protect highly pristine natural areas while enhancing visitor experiences, and efforts are focused on enhancing tourist satisfaction while raising awareness about tourism within the PAs of national parks.</p><p>In the present study, we conducted a destination-specific analysis of major national parks in Japan using an online questionnaire to identify the factors that determine tourist satisfaction.</p><p>Specifically, we examined whether tourist satisfaction is associated with tourist attributes such as gender and age, accessibility to the park (physical distance from tourists' residential area to destination), awareness about the national park (whether the visitor knew the tourists spot was in the national park), specific destinations visited within the park (such as "Mt. Fuji," "Shiga Highland," or "Itsukushima-jinja Shrine"), motivations for visiting (e.g., "scenic enjoyment" or "mountain trekking"), and the protection level for each destination. By revealing the factors influencing tourist satisfaction, this study can potentially contribute to the enhancement of tourist satisfaction, ultimately promoting the sustainable utilization of PAs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Study area</head><p>Three national parks in Japan, Fuji-Hakone-Izu National Park, Joshin'etsukogen National Park, and Setonaikai National Park, were selected as the survey locations (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). The "Natural Park System" stands as the most influential element of Japan's nature conservation framework. Under this system, Natural Parks are designated and managed according to the Natural Parks Act, which focuses on outstanding natural landscapes that adequately represent Japan's scenery (Natural Parks Act, Chapter 1 Article 2, 1957).</p><p>Natural parks are categorized into three types based on the management system: "national parks," "quasi-national parks," and "prefectural nature parks." Among these, national parks are those that are administered by the Ministry of the Environment. Management and utilization of national parks adhere to the regulations outlined in the Natural Parks Act. The park management plan incorporates zoning, which divides the land into more strictly regulated "special zones" and less restrictive "ordinary zones." Special zones are areas with outstanding natural scenery that need to be maintained in their current states, while ordinary zones are areas outside the special zones.</p><p>Both types of areas are accessible to tourists, and there are limited restrictions on existing human activities, such as residential and economic activities. However, the restrictions on developments differ between the two zones. Any modification within special zones requires prior permission for park authorities, while park authorities can just be notified for modifications in ordinary zones.</p><p>Additionally, special zones include subcategories such as "special protection zones" tailored to the level of conservation required. Zoning decisions are based on geographical, biological, and historical considerations. Currently, Japan has 34 designated national parks. The parks selected for the present survey are three of the top national parks in terms of total number of visitors in 2019 (https://www.env.go.jp/park/doc/data.html). These parks are popular destinations for both domestic and international tourists and attract diverse tourists. Moreover, they exhibit distinct geographical features, including urban areas, mountainous regions, and coastlines, that provide a variety of tourist activities. These factors make them suitable choices for the destinationspecific analysis of tourist satisfaction in this study. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Methodology</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Online questionnaire survey</head><p>We conducted an online survey to investigate past visits to tourist destinations, motivations for those visits, and levels of satisfaction (on a 5-point scale, see below The questionnaire consisted of 6 questions in total (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">1</ref>). In question 1, respondents were asked to select the national parks they had visited among the three, narrowing down the respondents to those who had visited at least one park. Remaining individuals, who did not select any park in Q1, were excluded from the survey. Before answering the questionnaire, we explicitly notified the respondents that "visit" in this questionnaire specifically refers to travelling with the purpose of tourism and not for residential or transit purposes. To avoid the confounding effects of COVID-19 on tourist satisfaction, we asked respondents to recall their visits before March 2020 (i.e., before the COVID-19 pandemic). Even if a person visits the same tourist destination multiple times, their motivations may change. To ensure consistency in responses regarding visiting time and motivations, respondents were instructed to answer based on their most recent visit.</p><p>In question 2, one of the national parks selected in Q1 was randomly specified, and the respondents were asked to answer questions about that park. To investigate the destinations and motivations for visiting, respondents were asked to select all the tourist destinations they visited from a list of 39 locations within the national park (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1-S3</ref>; Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">S1</ref>). In question 4, respondents rated how well their selected motivation from Q3 was fulfilled using a 5-point scale.</p><p>Finally, in question 5, to ascertain their place of residence, respondents were asked to provide their postal code. Additionally, did you know that the tourist destinations that you selected are within the designated area of the national park?</p><p>Tourist destination: 39 choices and/or free-text entry. e.g., "Mt. Fuji," "Itsukushima-jinja Shrine," and "Shiga Highland" Awareness of national park: "yes" or "no" Q3 What was the motivation for your visit to the selected tourist destination? Please choose the most applicable option. 17 choices and/or free-text entry. "To enjoy the scenery" "To observe unique flora and fauna" "To visit shrines and temples" "To enjoy mountain trekking and hiking" "To enjoy camping" "To enjoy skiing and snowboarding" "To enjoy golfing" "To enjoy a drive and tour" "To enjoy swimming and diving" "To learn about flora and fauna" "To learn about local history" "To relax at a hot spring" "To enjoy meals prepared from local produce" "To enjoy fishing and gathering wild vegetables" "To get away from daily life" "To volunteer for cleaning and other activities" "To maintain physical health" Q4 How satisfied were you with the selected motivation for your visit? "5. Very satisfied" "4. Satisfied" "3. Neither" "2. Not satisfied" "1. Not satisfied at all" Q5 Please provide your postal code.</p><p>Entry type</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Data analysis</head><p>The data obtained from the survey underwent a thorough selection process before statistical analysis was conducted. Initially, the responses were scrutinized, and any data deemed inappropriate or insufficient were excluded. First, locations outside the designated national park boundaries were excluded when considering the free-text responses in Q2 regarding the tourist destinations visited. Similarly, responses indicating motivations such as commuting or attending school in free-text responses in Q3 were considered irrelevant to the survey's focus on "visit as a travel destination" and were thus excluded.</p><p>Free-text responses regarding visiting motivations were first assigned to the appropriate options among those provided. Answers that did not align with the pre-defined choices were categorized as "others." However, this "others" category was excluded from the subsequent analysis, as it included diverse motivations (e.g., "to meet friends" and "for annual events"). The decision to consolidate these responses into a single category labeled "others" and treat them equivalently to other visit motivations was deemed inappropriate.</p><p>All statistical analyses were conducted using the R software (version 4.1.2).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.1.">Grouping of tourist destinations based on visit motivations</head><p>First, tourist destinations within the national parks were grouped based on the reported visit motivations. The national parks included in this study vary significantly in their geographical features and encompass diverse tourist destinations, such as coastlines, mountains, and cultural heritage sites. Consequently, visit motivations are likely to differ depending on each tourist destination, and the factors contributing to satisfaction may also vary. Thus, we deemed it necessary to group destinations based on visit motivations to analyze the factors influencing satisfaction.</p><p>Principal component analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis were conducted to categorize the tourist destinations. To summarize the 17 visit motivations, PCA was performed using the proportions of reported visit motivations for each tourist destination. For instance, for "Mt. Fuji,"</p><p>if the number of respondents who visited was 329, and among them, 193 chose "to enjoy the scenery," the value for "to enjoy the scenery" at "Mt. Fuji" would be 193/329. From PCA, seven principal components with eigenvalues exceeding 1 were retained, contributing to a cumulative contribution rate of approximately 70%.</p><p>Using the loadings of the seven principal components obtained from PCA as variables, a distance matrix was calculated using Pearson's correlation coefficient with the "proxy" package in R. Cluster analysis was performed using the k-means function from the "stats" package, which is a nonhierarchical clustering method. The number of clusters was determined as three, which was confirmed as the appropriate number based on the silhouette index (an average silhouette index was over 0.7) obtained from the "NbClust" package in R <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Tessema et al., 2022)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.2.">Exploring factors influencing tourist satisfaction</head><p>To identify the factors influencing tourist satisfaction, an ordinal logit regression model was used, which is a generalized linear model that predicts the probability of an outcome occurring based on several factors, particularly when the dependent variable is ordinal. The results are primarily interpreted from the odds ratios, which represent the change in the odds of an event occurring due to a one-unit change in a predictor variable. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Komossa et al. (2020)</ref> also employed generalized linear models, including logistic regression, to evaluate tourism in PAs.</p><p>The dependent variable was tourist satisfaction, and the explanatory variables included five factors (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">2</ref>). Satisfaction was assessed using a 5-point scale in response to Q4 (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">1</ref>).</p><p>The explanatory variables included gender (men/women), age, awareness of national parks (yes/no), distance from the respondent's residential area to the tourist destination, and level of protection (ordinary/special zones). Gender, awareness of national parks, and level of protection were converted into categorical variables, whereas age was treated as numerical data. Distance from the respondent's residential area to the tourist destination was calculated using the respondent's postal code and standardized to the straight-line distance between the centroid of the residential area defined by the postal code and the destination they visited. The package "Geosphere" in R was used for the calculations. In the model, we included the ID of each respondent and the identity of the national park where the tourist destination was included as random effects. The analysis was conducted using the package "ordinal" in R. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Respondents' characteristics</head><p>A total of 1,175 responses was obtained from respondents who had visited the national parks before the COVID-19 pandemic (i.e., before March 2020). Most of the respondents were "men" (70.4%),</p><p>within "50-59 years" of the age (28.4%), and residing in the "Kanto" region (51.2%) (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">3</ref>). The most common motivation for visiting the national parks was "to enjoy the scenery" (Fig. <ref type="figure">S4</ref>).</p><p>"To get away from daily life" was a characteristic motivation for visit to Fuji-Hakone-Izu National Park compared with the other two national parks. Meanwhile, for Setonaikai National Park, a notable motivation was "to visit shrines and temples." For Joshin'etsukogen Park, the distinct characteristic motivations included "to enjoy mountain trekking or hiking," "to enjoy skiing or snowboarding," and "to relax in hot springs." The geographic and cultural characteristics of each national park, such as mountains, shrines, and coastlines, were reflected in the motivations for visiting each park.</p><p>Through PCA (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">S2</ref>) and cluster analysis, 117 destinations were categorized into three groups based on the motivation for visit (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>; Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">4</ref>). In the first group ("landscape type"), the highest percentage of responses was for "to enjoy the scenery" (74.2%) while "to enjoy a drive or tour" was the second most common motivation (Fig. <ref type="figure">S5</ref>). The "mountain activity type" group comprised destinations that included motivations for carrying out physical activities in mountainous areas such as "to enjoy mountain trekking or hiking" and "to enjoy skiing or snowboarding." The "diverse motivation type" group included destinations with motivations like "to relax in hot springs" and "to visit shrines and temples." There were no substantial differences in the respondent demographics among the groups (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">S3</ref>). Moreover, satisfaction levels did not significantly vary among the groups (p &gt; 0.05, confirmed by Kruskal-Wallis test).  Finally, for the diverse motivation-type destinations, tourists who were women, younger, lived farther away from the destination(s), or were aware that the destination(s) was designated within the national park had a higher satisfaction. In the model, when the explanatory variable was categorical, the results were compared with an optional reference category. The reference categories are "men" (gender), "no" (awareness of the national park), and "ordinary zone" (level of protection).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Discussion</head><p>The most common motivation for visiting the national parks was "to enjoy the scenery," suggesting that tourist destinations within national parks are widely perceived as scenic spots (Fig. <ref type="figure">S4</ref>). Given that approximately 60% of the respondents were unaware that their destinations were located within national parks (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">S3</ref>), it is likely that people did not necessarily decide to visit these destinations because they were situated in national parks.</p><p>Women consistently showed higher satisfaction than men across all destination groups, revealing a gender disparity in satisfaction (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">5</ref>). Previous studies have also highlighted variations in attitudes towards ecotourism and associated services based on gender <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Del Mar Alonso-Almeida, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Quynh et al., 2021)</ref>. Gender disparities in satisfaction could be attributed to women's greater experience in visiting nature and sensitivity to the natural environment compared with men <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Zelezny et al., 2000)</ref>. Furthermore, women tend to experience higher social and aesthetic satisfaction, whereas men tend to experience higher physical satisfaction <ref type="bibr">(Kobayashi, 1993)</ref>. Indeed, specific motivations for visiting that exhibited significant gender disparity in the present study were "to enjoy the scenery" and "to observe unique flora and fauna" (Fig. <ref type="figure">S6</ref>),</p><p>aligning with the higher social and aesthetic sensitivity of women compared with men, as suggested in previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Zhang et al., 2023)</ref>.</p><p>Older tourists had lower satisfaction with mountain activities and diverse motivation types than younger tourists (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">5</ref>). Accumulated experiences with increasing age may explain this observation. Previous studies have suggested a reciprocal influence between age and ecotourism <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Lawton, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Vigolo et al., 2018)</ref>; individuals with extensive life experiences, typically associated with older age, may find it challenging to have experiences that exceed their expectations before their recent visits.</p><p>Tourists who resided far from their destinations had a higher satisfaction in the landscape and diverse motivation types compared with those who resided nearby (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">5</ref>). This could be attributed to the cost difference associated with traveling to the destinations. A critical difference between visits to closer and more distant residential areas is the overall cost of travel, which includes transportation and accommodation. In the case of travel that incurs significant costs, sightseeing plans at the destination should likely be made well before departure. If a predetermined sightseeing plan is successfully implemented, tourists may achieve higher satisfaction. Previous studies have shown that higher travel costs are correlated with higher overall satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Acharya et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Mutanga et al., 2017)</ref>, suggesting that higher expenses for distant travel may positively impact tourist satisfaction.</p><p>Across all destination groups, individuals who were aware that the tourist destination was situated within a designated national park reported higher satisfaction than those who were unaware (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">5</ref>). This underscores the significance of pre-visit information. Those who were informed about the designated area before their visit likely acquired information through various channels such as advertisements, word-of-mouth, tourist guides, and other sources. This pre-visit information can provide clarity regarding the features and activities available at the destination, contributing to meeting or even exceeding visitors' expectations and elevating satisfaction levels.</p><p>Previous studies have also highlighted the positive influence of pre-visit information on ecotourism experiences <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Castellanos-Verdugo et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Ezebilo, 2013)</ref>, highlighting its potential impact on tourist satisfaction.</p><p>The effect of the level of protection on satisfaction varied among the destination groups (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">5</ref>), indicating that the desired protection level varies depending on the specific needs of the tourist destination. In the landscape type destinations, a trend emerged where satisfaction was lower in "special zones." In particular, for visit motivations such as "to enjoy the scenery" and "to enjoy a drive or tour," the protection level significantly influenced satisfaction (Fig. <ref type="figure">S7</ref>). For instance, in cases where the motivation was "to enjoy a drive or tour," areas with less stringent regulations and well managed and good infrastructures (such as roads and bridges) appeared to be more satisfying for the tourists. Conversely, in the mountain type destinations, "special zones" tended to yield higher satisfaction levels. Mountain type destinations often attract individuals interested in camping, skiing, or snowboarding which entail direct interactions with nature.</p><p>Thus, by conducting a destination-specific analysis, this study provides a comprehensive picture of tourist satisfaction and its determinants across major national parks in Japan. In particular, we demonstrated that the effect of protection level on tourist satisfaction varies depending on the destination group. For instance, in landscape-type destinations such as the Seto Ohashi Bridge, tourists may enjoy scenery from the bridge and other built infrastructures. Tourist satisfaction with landscape-type destinations would thus increase in destinations located within ordinary zones. In contrast, in mountain activity-type destinations, such as the Shiga Highland, a preference for more immersive, natural landscapes may be important for meeting tourist demands.</p><p>Tourist satisfaction for this destination type would thus be enhanced in destinations located within special zones. Our results underscore the importance of destination analysis to fully understand visitors' demands and satisfaction in ecotourism.</p><p>This study has several limitations. First, the study was confined to only three parks.</p><p>Expanding the scope to encompass a broader range of parks would not only enhance the effectiveness of comparing and validating the results but also provide a more comprehensive understanding of tourist behavior. Second, the factors examined in our study may not independently and directly influence tourist satisfaction. Satisfaction is a multidimensional emotional response, as highlighted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Xu et al. (2021)</ref>. Therefore, it remains unclear on which specific dimensions the factors studied here have an impact. Moreover, certain factors beyond those considered in this study, such as observed biota, crowd levels, and on-site employees' attitudes, have been previously reported to influence visitor satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Oviedo-García et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Prakash et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Torres-Sovero et al., 2012)</ref>. To gain a more comprehensive understanding of tourist satisfaction, additional research, such as conducting multiple surveys before and after the tourist experience to track temporal changes, are necessary, as suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Albayrak and Caber (2018)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusions</head><p>This study sheds light on tourist dynamics, including their motivations for visiting and satisfaction levels, thereby providing valuable insights into enhancing overall tourist satisfaction within national parks. Tourist satisfaction generally increased with greater distance from the tourist residential area to the destination. Additionally, tourists who were aware that the destination was situated within a designated national park reported higher satisfaction levels than those who were unaware. These results collectively suggest that increasing awareness about national parks and the associated knowledge input from visual, verbal, and sensory stimuli, including advertisements and television programming, will help enhance tourist satisfaction and improve economic circulation in rural areas by increasing tourism from outside the region.</p><p>Furthermore, we demonstrated that the effect of protection level on tourist satisfaction varies depending on the destination group and tourists' motivation for visiting. This underscores the importance of tailoring management strategies to address the unique requirements of different destinations within a park, thereby facilitating tourist satisfaction and experience. Our study advances the understanding of tourist satisfaction through a destination-specific analysis in PAs.</p><p>Enhancing tourist satisfaction should be a cornerstone of sustainable tourism in PAs, and this study thus provides a valuable foundation for future research and management initiatives.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
