<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Public organizations face increasing challenges in attracting and retaining a qualified and diverse workforce <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Sievert, Vogel, and Feeney 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Jakobsen, Løkke, and Keppeler 2023)</ref>. At the same time, public organizations strive to promote diversity within their workforce (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Greenan et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Linos, 2018)</ref>. Fostering gender diversity through recruitment is relevant from two distinct perspectives. First, scholars point to an intrinsic value of diversity, especially related to gender. In combination with other factors, diversity can increase organizational performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Ding, Lu, and Riccucci 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">McCrea, Zhu, and Johansen 2022)</ref>. Second, attracting a more diverse set of job seekers promises to increase the pool of applicants because it creates a broader interest in working for public organizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Ng and Sears 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Olsen et al. 2016)</ref>. We focus on a potential hurdle to recruiting for diversity: gender sorting. This theoretical mechanism offers an explanation for why gender imbalances occur in the public sector despite a high commitment to fostering hiring for diversity <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Johnston, Alberti, and Kravariti, 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr">Opstrup and Villadsen)</ref>.</p><p>When aiming to increase gender diversity, public organizations primarily try to attract more diverse applicants at the beginning of the recruitment process <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Newman and Lyon 2009)</ref>. For public organizations, job advertisements constitute the initial (and often the only) step when targeting potential candidates. By reading and interpreting job advertisements, job seekers can then infer the characteristics of the job and the organization necessary to decide whether to apply <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Sievert, Vogel, and Feeney 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Vogel, Döring, and Sievert 2024)</ref>. Despite aiming to utilize job advertisements to foster diversity (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Linos, 2018)</ref>, they can have unintended effects on potential applicants. The way in which public organizations present themselves in job advertisements can considerably affect organizational attraction <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Sievert, Vogel, and Feeney 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Keppeler and Papenfuß 2021)</ref> and, thus, can result in sorting mechanisms on the labor market <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Castilla and Rho 2023)</ref>. Sorting mechanisms constitute shifts on the labor market, simultaneously increasing the attraction of some groups while discouraging others (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Fernandez &amp; Friedrich, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Rivera, 2012)</ref>. Focusing on gender sorting mechanisms is relevant for theory development and from a practical perspective. Still, public administration research falls short of addressing this potential hurdle to both recruitment and diversity management. Even though scholars and practitioners commonly advocate addressing the genderedness of job advertisements, robust empirical studies are scarce (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Vogel et al., 2023)</ref>.</p><p>We address this research gap by theorizing two separate mechanisms of gender sorting in job advertisements. We argue that (1) gendered language and (2) the gender of the contact person can discourage women (and men) from applying to specific vacancies <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Fernandez and Friedrich 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Castilla and Rho 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Gaucher, Friesen, and Kay 2011)</ref>. Previous scholarship indicates that traditionally male-associated occupations often employ assertive, agentic language, while job advertisements for stereotypically female-related roles may utilize more communal language <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Gaucher, Friesen, and Kay 2011)</ref>. Moreover, job advertisements display an indication of the contact person's gender, which is relevant because this is the first point of contact <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Castilla and Rho 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Hentschel et al. 2021)</ref>. As such, we theorize that representation effects should lead to additional gender sorting.</p><p>To test our hypotheses, we analyze a novel multi-source dataset containing the texts and meta-data from real job advertisements. We subjected the texts to a machine learning model to analyze the job advertisements' language for masculinity and femininity; the contact person's gender was manually coded. We combine this dataset with matched survey responses about the recruitment process and the applicant pool from the recruiters who posted the job advertisements (n = 1,859 matched observations). The findings from hierarchical linear models indicate that feminine wording relates to a higher number and share of applications by women. A female contact person did not exhibit statistically significant effects. Additionally, we find that gendered language is unrelated to a higher number of applications, the recruiters' perception of the quality of applicants, and the satisfaction with the selected candidate.</p><p>Our study contributes to public administration research and provides insights for policymakers and practitioners. First, we theorize and empirically demonstrate gender sorting mechanisms in public sector labor markets. Our study demonstrates the relevance of seemingly subtle aspects of public sector recruitment. While previous studies focus on formal diversity policies broadly <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Groeneveld and Verbeek 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Satzger and Vogel 2023)</ref>, sectoral differences <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Cordes and Vogel 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Fowler and Birdsall 2020)</ref>, or motivational factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Asseburg et al. 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Kjeldsen and Jacobsen 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Vogel, Döring, and Sievert 2024)</ref>, we provide a different and promising perspective. We outline how gender sorting mechanisms constitute a relevant research focus for scholars addressing diversity management and recruiting. Our theorizing integrates the public administration literature with research on organizational psychology and human resource management, allowing a robust theoretical perspective advancing the discourse on public sector recruiting. Second, the study sheds light on how gender sorting affects (or fails to affect) public organizations. Since gendered language did not relate to changes in the quality of applicants (and the selected candidate), we can posit that public organizations likely do not experience many adverse consequences arising from gendered language practices. Overall, our findings have important implications. For jobs lacking gender diversity, we suggest critically evaluating the recruitment processes' genderedness, specifically the language used in job advertisements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theoretical Framework</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Job Advertisements and Gender Sorting</head><p>Public sector recruiters primarily rely on job advertisements to attract applicants for vacancies <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Sievert, Vogel, and Feeney 2022)</ref>. Posting job advertisements ensures a quick and comprehensible overview of the job and the organization while indicating which type of applicants the employer tries to attract <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Baum and Kabst 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Breaugh 2013)</ref>. This initial point of contact is relevant to reducing information asymmetries for job seekers <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Connelly et al. 2011)</ref>. Public organizations harness this early point of contact to maximize attractiveness and convey what they expect from applicants <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(De Cooman &amp; Pepermans, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Walker &amp; Hinojosa, 2013)</ref>. Recruiters actively shape how job advertisements reflect these aspects and what best to include (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Kuhn &amp; Shen, 2023)</ref>, aiming to attract a sufficient number of desirable candidates. In this study, we deliberately focus on the gender diversity of the applicant pool. As such, job advertisements deterring diverse candidates, e.g., women in male-dominated professions, would counteract public organizations' efforts to increase diversity. This phenomenon, coined gender sorting, can considerably undermine the recruitment efforts of public organizations. Gender sorting constitutes a systematic mechanism where male and female job seekers exhibit structurally different application choices for a vacancy <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Fernandez and Friedrich 2011)</ref>. The information provided initially in job advertisements affects whether job seekers consider applying for a given vacancy (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Gomes &amp; Neves, 2011)</ref>, whether they remain in the selection process (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Ryan et al., 2000)</ref>, and whether they accept a potential job offer (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Hausknecht et al., 2004)</ref>. Theoretical arguments from management and organization science help explain potential decision-making processes underlying the gender sorting mechanism. First, language in job advertisements should affect gender sorting in applicant pools and the recruitment processes in general <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Gaucher, Friesen, and Kay 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Hentschel et al. 2021)</ref>. Several studies showcase that gendered wording is present in job advertisements (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Gaucher et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Hodel et al., 2017)</ref>, constituting the descriptive component of our research focus. Furthermore, these observed differences also exhibit consequences for gender diversity. Masculine wording can negatively affect whether women perceive a given vacancy as attractive <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Gaucher, Friesen, and Kay 2011)</ref>. Second, aside from the wording of the vacancy description, the contact person's gender has been suggested as a potentially significant signal for a job advertisement's genderedness <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Hentschel et al. 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Castilla and Rho 2023)</ref>. This reasoning aligns with the representative bureaucracy research. Following arguments on symbolic representation (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Theobald &amp; Haider-Markel, 2009)</ref>, the contact person could act as a tangible signal about the job and the organization, resulting in structurally different application choices by men and women. As such, the gender of a contact person could result in a similar yet separate gender sorting mechanism.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Gendered Language and Recruitment Outcomes</head><p>Previous scholarship indicates that traditionally male-associated occupations often employ agentic, action-oriented language, such as "lead," "compete," and "dominant." Job advertisements for typically female-related roles may utilize more communal language and words like "support," "understand," and "interpersonal skills" <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Gaucher, Friesen, and Kay 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Askehave and Zethsen 2014)</ref>. This gendered usage of language mirrors prevalent gender norms and, in turn, can influence job applicants' perceptions and expectations of a particular role <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Castilla and Rho 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Coffman, Collis, and Kulkarni 2024)</ref>. The root causes of these imbalances are subject to various theoretical perspectives. For example, theories such as social role theory argue that entrenched societal expectations of gender roles manifest in the choice of language in job advertisements <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Dutz, Hubner, and Peus 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Hodel et al. 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Vervecken, Hannover, and Wolter 2013)</ref>. Previous scholarship suggests that unconscious biases can affect how individuals express informationsubconsciously, an employer or recruiter may associate certain roles with specific genders due to societal stereotypes, resulting in gendered language <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Gaucher, Friesen, and Kay 2011)</ref>. In addition, incorporating ideas from stereotype threat theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Spencer, Logel, and Davies 2016)</ref> helps explore the consequences of gendered language for applicant behavior in the labor market <ref type="bibr">(Dinhof et al., 2023)</ref>. This theoretical perspective identifies a deterring effect of mismatched language. Scholars argue that job advertisements using heavily gendered language can discourage candidates who do not identify with the associated gender from applying. For instance, women might feel less qualified or welcomed by job advertisements exhibiting traditionally masculine language, even if they are well equipped for the role.</p><p>While job advertisements typically indicate that all genders are welcome to apply, the overall wording of the advertisement may still be imbalanced. Previous research indicates that job advertisements display gendered language, especially for gender-dominated fields, arguing that gendered language originates from gender dominance in a given profession <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Gaucher, Friesen, and Kay 2011)</ref>. We expect that the wording used in public sector job advertisements reflects underlying gender imbalances of jobs, occupations, or even sub-sectors. Such gendered language conveys information about which type of prospective employee the organization desires <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Castilla and Rho 2023)</ref> and sustains gender stereotypes related to occupations (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Vervecken et al., 2013)</ref>. We argue that gendered wording will affect the composition of the initial applicant pool. Scholarship in social psychology hints at how language affects individual behavior (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Ellemers, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Maass, 1999)</ref>. As outlined by <ref type="bibr">Gaucher et al. (2011, p. 111)</ref>, "subtle variations in the gendered wording used in advertisements may affect people's perception of jobs, such that men and women will find jobs described in language consistent with their own gender most appealing precisely because it signals they belong in that occupation." Job seekers may anticipate the potentially biased evaluations occurring during recruitment and selection <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Castilla and Rho 2023)</ref>. This relates to how job seekers judge competencies vis-à-vis the anticipated selection criteria and decisions of recruiters. Female job seekers likely estimate a lower probability of receiving a job offer in stereotypically male fields when this is reflected in a job advertisement's wording. In such cases, they tend to be more reluctant to apply <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Barbulescu and Bidwell 2013)</ref>. We expect that those job advertisements with stereotypically masculine wording will be associated with gender sorting and, thus, adverse recruitment outcomes related to gender diversity. On the other hand, we expect that feminine wording should have the opposite effect, i.e., more women applying. The individual choices in the labor market should result in a structural change of applicant pools for given vacancies. Hence, we expect job advertisements with stereotypically female wording to attract more female applicants and relate to a higher share of women. Formally, we hypothesize: H1a: Higher femininity of the job advertisements relates to a higher number of women applying to the advertised job.</p><p>H1b: Higher femininity of the job advertisements relates to a higher share of women (compared to men) applying to the advertised job.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Gender of Contact Person and Recruitment Outcomes</head><p>Job advertisements always relate to a recruitment process, including selection and hiring, once applications are received <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Vogel, Döring, and Sievert 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Sievert, Vogel, and Feeney 2022)</ref>.</p><p>Accordingly, organizations determine a person responsible for the recruitment process. This recruiter typically manages and distributes the job advertisements' development and realization <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Walker &amp; Hinojosa, 2013)</ref> and is often involved in subsequent steps of the recruiting process. Job seekers are generally aware of this when encountering a job advertisement <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Hentschel et al. 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Rynes, Bretz, and Gerhart 1991)</ref>. Hence, they can draw inferences based on whom the job advertisement displays as a contact person <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Castilla and Rho 2023)</ref>. Thus, we argue that the recruiter's gender, inferred based on the name and the salutation, likely affects job seekers' application choices.</p><p>We extend the reasoning by building on theoretical arguments suggesting that recruiters' gender affects job seekers within the overarching recruitment process. One reason relates to homophily <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Kazmi et al. 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Greenberg and Mollick 2017)</ref>, an argument that we can also find in representative bureaucracy theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Theobald and Haider-Markel 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Riccucci and Van Ryzin 2017)</ref>. Homophily theory suggests that individuals are more attracted to others they experience as similar to themselves <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(McPherson, Smith-Lovin, and Cook 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Kazmi et al. 2022</ref>). As such, job seekers could be more inclined to interact with recruiters matching their gender. Similarly, job seekers should also hold different expectations about the recruitment process depending on the gender of the contact person. Thus, congruence in minority status should affect the composition of the recruitment pool <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Stoll, Raphael, and Holzer 2004)</ref>. Women should be more willing to interact with this recruiter and potentially expect better chances to succeed. Hence, we expect more women to apply to these advertised jobs and a higher share of women in the applicant pool overall.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Formally, we hypothesize:</head><p>H2a: A female contact person in the job advertisements relates to a higher number of women applying to the advertised job.</p><p>H2b: A female contact person in the job advertisements relates to a higher share of women (compared to men) applying to the advertised job.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data and Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Source 1: Digital Job Advertisements</head><p>Our study builds on a multi-source dataset to provide robust inferences, as outlined in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>.</p><p>First, we collected the textual and metadata of job advertisements in Germany. We obtained advertisements posted on a central public sector recruitment website (http://www.bund.de) using an automatic web crawler over nine months between June 2020 and March 2021 (n = 58,668 job advertisements). Aside from the textual data, we extracted meta-data, such as contract type, salary tier, or job type. The job type variable consists of 18 different categories (e.g., general administration, IT, or education). We aggregated these categories into six larger subsectors (administrative, business, science, social, technical, and others). To ensure high data quality, we employed a data-cleaning process. Furthermore, we excluded advertisements without contact information. Our final database included 33,642 job advertisements.</p><p>This database provides us with several benefits. First, it encompasses solely public sector job advertisements, providing us with data of high relevance to public administration research.</p><p>Second, it contains advertisements from organizations of all governmental levels, types of public organizations, as well as geographic areas. This variety increases the ecological validity of our analysis. Third, the website is linked to other significant public sector job advertisement sites. Thus, we are sure we obtained most of the relevant job advertisements across Germany.</p><p>[Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> here]</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Source 2: Recruiter Survey</head><p>The textual data of the job advertisements is combined with survey data, which we collected from recruiters responsible for the respective advertised positions. This allows us to combine descriptive data about the content and language of the advertisements with relevant outcomes of the recruiting process. Due to the large amount of job advertisements, we restricted our sample. Specifically, we selected one advertisement per recruiter email using a randomization mechanism. Ultimately, we were left with a sample of 7,026 eligible recruiters. We used the email addresses listed in the contact information section of the selected job advertisements. We invited them all to participate in our survey in April 2021, ensuring that a considerable share of recruitment processes had already been concluded. The invitation indicated the specific job advertisement that the survey is referring to. This ensured that recruiters could refer specific questions to the specific recruitment processes.</p><p>After three weeks, a reminder was sent out to increase participation. 1,863 recruiters completed the survey (response rate = 26.5%).</p><p>The survey was implemented online. As the survey was conducted in German, we translated validated items and discussed critical cases among the research team and with a practitioner to ensure the face validity of our measures. To further strengthen the validity of our instrument, we took additional measures: First, we received peer feedback from a public sector recruiter to ensure that all relevant aspects of a successful recruitment process were covered in our survey. Second, we pre-tested our survey with public sector professionals and colleagues to ensure that item wording is comprehensible.</p><p>The following survey items were included to test our hypotheses. Unless indicated otherwise, all items were measured on a 7-point Likert scale (1 = fully disagree, 7 = fully agree).</p><p>Appendix A shows the exact wording of the items.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Number of female applicants:</head><p>Additionally, we asked recruiters to indicate the number of applicants who identified as female. This measure assesses the advertisement's success in attracting more female applicants. Furthermore, combining both frequency measures, we calculated the share of female applicants per advertisement. This allows for assessing whether specific advertisement features make jobs generally more attractive or for female applicants only.</p><p>We added three additional measures of recruitment success: (1) Number of applicants: To account for the argument that a larger applicant pool is beneficial for the overall recruitment process, we included a measure for that quantity of applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Becker and Huselid 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Collins and Han 2004)</ref>. ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>) Satisfaction with the applicant pool: We asked recruiters about their satisfaction with their respective application pool. Building on <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Collins &amp; Han (2004)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Dineen &amp; Allen (2016)</ref>, we used a scale consisting of four items (Cronbach's α = .85). Respondents gave their assessment of the pool's overall, quality, the recruiters' expectations, and the potential of picking adequate candidates. (3) Satisfaction with the selected candidate: If recruiters indicated that the process led to an appointment, we asked them about their satisfaction with the respective candidate (n = 1,400). This variable provides an especially interesting contribution to previous research as we include data about actual recruitment decisions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Source 3: Register Data</head><p>As our data is observational, we included a rich set of supplementary data from registries. This allows controlling for the share of women working in a particular job and avoids capturing a spurious relationship if the language in job advertisements for jobs predominantly occupied by women is more female. We used data on the share of women in 31 jobs in the state of Hamburg (Personalamt Hamburg 2022) and categorized each job advertisement in our dataset according to the scheme. Additionally, we controlled for the geographic location of the organization and the respective population density using data from the Federal Statistical Office of Germany. This measure of urbanicity might affect the attractiveness of a job and the likelihood of female applications. Lastly, we manually coded the governmental level of our respective public organizations (federal, state, local, and social security administrations (independently organized in Germany) and others).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical Analysis</head><p>When examining (gendered) language, the main challenge is identifying a reliable and valid indicator. Previous research used a predefined set of 83 feminine or masculine words <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Gaucher, Friesen, and Kay 2011)</ref> to assess how strongly a particular text uses gendered language. This approach, however, does not allow for differentiation between strongly gendered and mildly gendered words. Hence, we adopt a different approach to determine how gendered the language of a text is, namely word embeddings <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Castilla and Rho 2023)</ref>. Word embeddings are a widely used machine learning technique in computational text analysis. This approach represents each (part of a) word as a vector of numbers. The vectors are created in a way that they represent the semantic meaning of a word in a way that words that are close to each other in the vector space are close in meaning. These vectors are created by training a machine-learning model with a large text corpus. Unlike previous studies, we used fastText because it was the best-performing unsupervised model for detecting gendered language in a study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Cryan et al. (2020)</ref>. We used the pre-trained fastText model <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Grave et al. 2018)</ref>, trained on about three million words from German Wikipedia and around 17.7 million words from scraped German websites<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> . fastText allows the calculation of a femininity score for each advertisement to infer how gendered the language is in a job advertisement. The femininity score for a single word is calculated by subtracting the similarity of the word with a masculine reference word (such as "man") from the similarity to the feminine antonym (such as "woman") and multiplying it by 100. This way, words with a feminine loading receive a high positive score, and masculineloaded words have a high negative score. For example, cultural-sensible has a score of 7.0, and ambition has a score of -8.0. Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> presents a representation of the vector-based distances of exemplary words. We repeated this approach with four antonym pairs (woman-man, womenmen, female-male, and feminine-masculine)<ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">2</ref> and calculated the femininity score for all words in every job advertisement as the mean of these four values. Each job advertisement was assigned a single femininity score by averaging the score of all words in the ad. Appendix B showcases the approach for two exemplary job advertisements. In addition, we coded the recruiter's gender based on the salutation and name presented in the respective job advertisement.</p><p>[Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> here] We can draw meaningful inferences from the calculated femininity score, the recruiter's gender, and the rich information captured in our dataset. Since we focus on the relation of gendered language and recruiter gender with recruitment outcomes, we subjected the data to regression analysis. Because our data structure is clustered, we ran hierarchical linear regression models with five different dependent variables collected with the recruiter survey: The number of applications received for the advertisement, the number of women applied, the proportion of women among all applications, recruiters' satisfaction with the applications, and with the selected candidate. The hierarchical regression models build on the recruiter's assessment provided in the survey as level 1 (n = 1,859) and on the information gathered about the recruiting organizations (k = 1,023) as level 2. The resulting intercept-only models include the covariates to account for variation related to the recruitment process, the job, and the organization.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Descriptive Overview</head><p>First, we provide descriptive statistics (full overview in Appendix C). The number of women applying for a job differs widely, with a mean of 12.76 (SD = 20.96, Median = 6.00), and their share of all applications is 51.39 % (SD = 30.70). On average, the job advertisements have a femininity score of -0.233 (SD = 0.356), indicating a relatively neutral use of language with a slight tendency towards masculine words. The descriptive analysis indicates an average of 22.38 applications following the job advertisements (SD = 30.42). In addition, recruiters indicate a mean satisfaction of 4.24 for the applicant pool (SD = 1.51) and 6.04 for the selected candidate (SD = 1.50). Furthermore, our sample has a high variability of jobs and organizations. In addition, Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> specifies the distribution of the femininity score across the job advertisements. The scores follow a normal distribution with few high and low values.</p><p>[Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> here]</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hypothesis Testing</head><p>We used two hierarchical linear models to test the effects of gendered language and gender of the contact person. The regression models account for a wide range of potentially confounding factors, including the "share of women in job category." This variable ensures that we do not overestimate the main effect, primarily because women are more likely to apply to femaledominated jobs. Advertisements for these jobs tend to use more feminine words. The main results are depicted in Table <ref type="table">2</ref>; Appendix C outlines a complete table including all covariates.</p><p>We find support for our hypotheses H1a and H1b. A higher femininity score is associated with an increased number of applications by women (H1a, model 1: b = 7.378, SE = 1.509, p &lt; 0.001) and a higher share of female applicants (H1b, model 2: b = 18.511, SE = 1.801, p &lt; 0.001).</p><p>Consequently, a higher masculinity score is associated with a lower number and smaller share of women applying. This implies that the femininity of language present in job advertisements attracts more female applicants in absolute numbers and more in comparison with male applicants. A one-unit increase in the femininity score attracts more than seven additional applications from women while increasing the share of female applicants by almost 19 %.</p><p>Regarding H2a and H2b, we find that a female contact person is not associated with a statistically significant higher number (model 1: b = -0.404, SE = 0.932, p = .664) of female applicants. The contact person's gender is slightly related to a higher share of female applicants but only on a 10 % significance level (model 2: b = 2.087, SE = 1.128, p = .065). Thus, our findings lend no support to either H2a or H2b.</p><p>[Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> here]</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Robustness Tests and Exploratory Analysis</head><p>Aside from the overall assessment of gender language in job advertisements, we further investigated potential interaction effects we deemed relevant. These results, however, should be considered solely exploratory due to the risk of multiple testing and lack of theoretical elaborations. First, we investigated whether the significant associations of gendered language found in our hypotheses-guided analysis results from heterogeneity. Indeed, different job sectors, reflecting local gender imbalances (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Hoff et al., 2024)</ref>, may skew the findings. For that purpose, we included an interaction term for the sector with the lowest representation of women (see analysis in Appendix D), namely technical jobs. We find no statistically significant effect for that interaction (see Appendix F). Thus, this sub-sector does not seem to drive the overall effect.</p><p>Second, we investigated whether the effect of gendered language is especially strong or weak in job advertisements for leadership positions. We operationalized leadership positions based on the position's salary tier, correlating with leadership responsibilities in the German system. While toplevel management positions have a substantially lower share of female applicants (see Appendix G), we find no heterogenous effects of gendered language for that sub-group. Lastly, we also included additional outcome measures (see Appendix E). We find no effect of gendered language on the overall number of applications, the recruiters' satisfaction with the applicant pool's quality, or the selected candidate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Gender Sorting in Public Labor Markets</head><p>The results partially support our theorizing, showing that job advertisements with more feminine wording are associated with a higher number and share of women among the applicants. In turn, job advertisements exhibiting more masculine wording attracted fewer women. These findings support the central theoretical mechanism indicating that public sector labor markets are subject to gender sorting. We demonstrate that language used in job advertisements can discourage women (and men) from applying to specific vacancies <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Fernandez and Friedrich 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Castilla and Rho 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Gaucher, Friesen, and Kay 2011)</ref>. Our study demonstrates the relevance of seemingly subtle information signals for public sector recruitment. Previous studies focused on various factors contributing to recruitment outcomes, including diversity <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Jakobsen, Løkke, and Keppeler 2023)</ref>.</p><p>Scholars highlighted the relevance of formal diversity policies <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Groeneveld and Verbeek 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Satzger and Vogel 2023)</ref>, sectoral differences <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Cordes and Vogel 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Fowler and Birdsall 2020)</ref>, or motivational factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Asseburg et al. 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Kjeldsen and Jacobsen 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Vogel, Döring, and Sievert 2024)</ref>. While these factors often originate from arguments deeply embedded in public management and policy-oriented research, we expand the view to neighboring disciplines. We offer a robust and novel theoretical perspective on public sector recruitment. Our theorizing integrates the literature with research on organizational psychology and human resource management <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Castilla and Rho 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Gaucher, Friesen, and Kay 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Hentschel et al. 2021)</ref>.</p><p>Accordingly, gender sorting mechanisms constitute a relevant research focus for scholars addressing (gender) diversity in public administration research.</p><p>While gendered language had the expected effects, we did not observe a statistically significant effect for the contact person's gender. Contrary to our theorizing, the number and share of women applying was not higher if a woman was listed as the contact person. Following arguments from representative bureaucracy research (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Johnston et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Riccucci &amp; Van Ryzin, 2017)</ref>, we expect that the gender of the contact person might not be the most relevant signal for job seekers. Given that they will likely have limited contact with that person, especially after a potential hiring, their application decision seems unaffected. Instead, we suspect that who they would work with (e.g., supervisor) would be more relevant (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Sievert, 2023)</ref>. However, such information is seldom disclosed in job advertisements and, thus, beyond the scope of this study.</p><p>Our combined findings contribute to public sector recruiting research because they illuminate our understanding of how gender sorting works and how it affects public organizations.</p><p>First, we found that the effect of gendered language is consistent and independent of sectoral subgroups or (non-)leadership positions. Second, we found that gendered language does not relate to the overall size of the application pool. Thus, the language effect seems to be symmetrical for both genders. Third, we analyzed the recruiters' perceived applicant pool quality, remaining unaffected. Thus, regardless of gendered wording and contact person, the job advertisements resulted in an equally qualified applicant pool. This finding is important because it negates a common criticism that diversity initiatives face. If gender sorting does not change applicant pool quality, policymakers and public organizations do not face a compromise when consciously developing tools to tackle masculine wording. Fourth, we also analyzed the recruiters' satisfaction with the selected candidate. Job advertisements with gendered language did not result in better or worse candidates. This finding reiterates the prior argument. Public organizations may use gendered language to achieve a more balanced workforce without detriment to these recruitment criteria. Some additional implications arise from these observations. First, policymakers and public organizations are well-advised to consider these findings. The gendered language and gender of the contact person do not affect the applicant pool's size or quality. If public organizations are unaware of the gender sorting mechanisms, they are unlikely to adjust recruitment practices.</p><p>Especially for jobs where diversity is still lacking, we suggest critically evaluating the recruitment processes' genderedness, specifically the language used in job advertisements. Several private sector organizations showcase potential approaches to reduce gendered language, e.g., through automated approaches to identify and remove gendered wording <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Castilla and Rho 2023)</ref>. Second, our findings account for potential criticisms related to a conscious use of gendered wording.</p><p>Altering how gendered a job advertisement is does not affect how successfully an organization attracts a qualified (or satisfactory) applicant pool. Instead, gendered language constitutes a precondition for either preferably hiring men or women for a given vacancy (explicitly or implicitly). As such, policymakers and public organizations striving for higher gender diversity could reduce gendered wording so as not to deter either gender from applying. Alternatively, they could deliberately use gendered language to facilitate gender diversity in their workforce actively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations and Future Research Agenda</head><p>Our research design and empirical analysis come with methodological compromises. We applied natural language processing (i.e., automated quantitative text analysis) to identify gendered language. While our analysis applies a robust analytical procedure tested in previous studies, natural language processing is seldom perfect. A common problem is the contextual embeddedness of individual words <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Correll et al. 2020)</ref>. Our approach includes rating each word in the job advertisement but does not entirely account for how it is used. For example, some words may be interpreted as feminine even though they are used with a neutral connotation. Thus, the femininity score constitutes a proxy for feminine language. We think it constitutes a good proxy for our chosen research design because it allows the simultaneous processing of many job advertisements (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Cryan et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Similarly, the survey-based approach used for the dependent variables introduces shortcomings. The dependent variables cannot objectively reflect recruitment outcomes, only subjectively. We compromise between the ability to match our data sources and precision. The measures, e.g., the number of applications and the quality of the applicant pool, are subject to potential biases and imprecision. Some respondents might generally overestimate how well a selected candidate fits the vacancy. We assume that recruiters are among those best suited to assess measures such as the quality of the application pool, but their perceptions may still be biased.</p><p>Future studies could try to implement a more complex assessment of recruitment outcomes, e.g., through triangulation. Given that multiple individuals collaborate in recruitment processes, future studies could try to capture the perceptions of these different individuals.</p><p>Our inferences are based on job advertisements in Germany. The national context may very well affect how gendered language works and how job seekers interpret, e.g., feminine wording.</p><p>In addition, public organizations in Germany may act differently when constructing job advertisements compared to their counterparts in other countries. Generally, they often have limited freedom about the content of job advertisements (resulting from, e.g., collective labor agreements). Thus, we call for replications across different countries and administrative traditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Walker et al., 2019)</ref>, also considering different public sector contexts.</p><p>Future research should further explore the research focus on gender sorting. Since recruitment entails a long process, including several episodes where applicants and organizations meet, e.g., job interviews, assessment centers, or negotiations, researchers could build on our findings and track the following recruitment process steps. Does the effect of gendered language carry through the following process steps? How substantial is the effect of gendered language in job advertisements compared to the role of individual recruiters? In addition, our design cannot directly observe but solely infer the micro-level decision-making of job seekers. Thus, further research on the decision-making of job seekers seems promising. While some studies already examine how gendered language affects potential job seekers (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Gaucher et al., 2011)</ref>, we see the need for further empirical testing. We need to understand how men and women process gendered language and how this affects their behavior in the labor market. Similarly, while we focus on applicant behavior, our research follows a central argument about recruiters: They more or less deliberately produce gendered job advertisements. Future research should, thus, examine what drives recruiters when preparing job advertisements and during the recruitment process more generally. Overall, we advocate for further investigating micro-level effects in recruitment processes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>Our study investigates the effect of focal gender signals found in basically all job advertisements: the genderedness of its language and the contact person's gender. We show that gendered language relates to the number and share of female applicants for respective vacancies. The recruiter's gender appears to be irrelevant. These findings are derived from a comprehensive set of webcrawled job advertisements combined with a recruiter survey and register data.</p><p>These findings emphasize the occurrence of gender sorting in public sector jobs based on the language used in job ads. Policymakers and recruiters are well-advised to consider these findings if they aim for a more representative workforce. Our exploratory analysis also indicates that there seems to be no negative effect on the size and quality of the application pool. Thus, our study provides several starting points for further investigation. As the investigated phenomenon of gender sorting is increasingly essential to several job sectors (like technical and social jobs), understanding underlying mechanisms is critical to tackling challenges of gender imbalance.</p><p>Moreover, these mechanisms might shed light on other self-selection processes beyond gender.   </p></div>
