<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Estimation of relationships between a dependent variable constructed by the aggregation of individual behaviour and aggregate independent variables such as mean income is common. The aim and contribution of the paper is to clarify when and how parameter estimates based on aggregates leads to bias and the likely degree of such bias. It demonstrates that use of aggregate data to estimate parameters associated with a model of individual behaviour when the outcome variable is binary (e.g. a birth) is not advisable. It only 'works' when the independent variables do not vary at the individual level (e.g. prices or the unemployment rate). Even then it requires prior distributional knowledge or assumptions. When the individual model also contains variables that vary across individuals, then the analysis in the paper suggests that all parameter estimates based solely on variation in the aggregates usually understate the size of their true value, even ones associated with variables which do not vary over individuals. Indeed, it is often the case that the 95% confidence interval of these latter parameter estimates never contains the parameter's true value.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>It is common to estimate relationships between a dependent variable constructed by the aggregation of individual behaviour and aggregate independent variables, such as mean income or the proportion with a particular attribute (e.g. achieved a university degree), as well as variables that do not vary over individuals (e.g. prices). The aggregate variables may be for countries or regions/states/provinces within a country, and the relationship may be estimated using variation among the geographic groups or within them over time (e.g. a time series of country aggregates). Fertility is a particularly problematic dependent variable because at the individual level its relation to the variables that influence it (e.g. age, education, family income, housing cost) is inherently non-linear. Thus, this study focuses on a binary outcome variable at the individual level. It's aim and contribution is to clarify when and how parameter estimates based on aggregates leads to bias and the likely degree of such bias. It shows that estimates of parameters from models formulated at the individual level with independent variables which vary over individuals are usually unreliable when estimated with aggregate data in contrast to individual data.<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Foundations</head><p>A good example is an equation relating a metropolitan area's fertility rate to area house prices and the proportion who are homeowners, such as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Aksoy (2016)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Dettling and Kearney (2014)</ref>, and a more recent example is <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Kearney and Levine (2022)</ref>, which relates a US state's birth rate to the state's unemployment rate and an aggregate measure of household spending.</p><p>Such equations are often interpreted as representing responses of individual fertility to independent variables, some of which are specific to the individual (e.g. homeownership status) rather than the area. But it is long-established that parameters estimated using aggregates do not generally correspond to the parameters at the individual level. In summarising earlier research, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Green (1964)</ref>  In this case, if (1) holds, then the relationship between area aggregates is</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">𝑦 = 𝛼 + 𝛽 𝑥 + 𝛽 𝑧<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where 𝛼 = ∑ 𝛼 /𝑛 is the average intercept for individuals in area a. As long as 𝛼 is not correlated with 𝑥 or 𝑧 , variation from aggregate cross-section data across areas would identify the 𝛽 parameters, as would time series data if a indicated 'time' for a particular geographic area (e.g. a country) rather than area. 2</p><p>2 Estimation of equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">3</ref>) by least squares across areas would identify the mean 𝛼 . Systematic sorting of individuals by areas could, however, induce a correlation between 𝛼 and 𝑥 or 𝑧 ; an example would be people with more favourable attitudes toward childbearing (higher 𝛼 ) moving to areas with lower housing costs.</p></div>

In the first instance, the seriousness of the aggregation bias issue was explored using simulations of parameter estimation from data generated by a known mechanism and results reported in the next section, and then in section 4 analysis with real data on individuals' fertility behaviour embedded within regions is reported.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Monte Carlo Simulations</head><p>Assume that 𝑦 is a dichotomous variable indicating whether a woman has a birth or not.</p><p>Define 𝑝𝑟𝑖𝑐𝑒 as a variable that only varies over area, not individuals; 𝑎𝑔𝑒 is a continuous variable for a woman's age; 𝑄 is a binary variable identifying two groups who differ in their intercept and possibly also their response to price (e.g. differentiating owners and tenants).</p><p>Define a latent variable equation for a woman i living in area a:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">𝑦 * =𝛽 + 𝛽 ln ( 𝑝𝑟𝑖𝑐𝑒 ) + 𝛾 (𝑎𝑔𝑒 -25)+ 𝛿 𝑄 +𝛿 𝑄 ln(𝑝𝑟𝑖𝑐𝑒 ) + 𝑢 = 𝜷′𝑿 + 𝑢 (6)</formula><p>where 𝑢 has a logistic distribution. Thus 𝑝 = Simulation 1: 𝛽 = -0.5, 𝛽 = -1, 𝛾 = 0, 𝛿 = 0, 𝛿 = 0. This is the simplest model considered. It corresponds with the special case 1.1 in which there is no systematic individual heterogeneity in the birth rate within areas. The model based on the aggregate data was assumed to take the form of equation ( <ref type="formula">4</ref>), and Table <ref type="table">1</ref> shows the parameter estimates based on individual data and aggregate data. We expect the estimates from both individual and aggregate data to be consistent estimators. The mean estimate of 𝛽 based on aggregate data is within one standard error of its true value. The confidence interval of 𝛽 from the aggregate data includes its true value much less than 95% of the time, but most of these breaches of the confidence interval are small. These are, however, ideal circumstances where we know the form of the individual birth rate equation and it does not depend on individual variables. Analogous results emerge when the aggregate birth probability is given by equation ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>) and ln( 𝑝𝑟𝑖𝑐𝑒 ) is the only regressor (Simulation 5A below in which the aggregate equation ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>) was estimated by used non-linear least squares).</p><p>Simulation 2 allows for binary heterogeneity in the intercept of the latent variable equation based on 𝑄 : 𝛽 = -1, 𝛽 = -1, 𝛿 = -1.5, 𝛿 = 0 and 𝛾 = 0.<ref type="foot" target="#foot_4">6</ref> The estimates from the individual data are, as expected, close to their true values, as Table <ref type="table">1</ref> shows. In the estimates using aggregate data, 𝑄 replaces 𝑄 : ln ( ) =𝛽 + 𝛽 ln(𝑝𝑟𝑖𝑐𝑒 ) + 𝛿 𝑄 . The size of the mean estimate of 𝛽 from the aggregate data is slightly biased downward. The confidence interval of 𝛽 includes its true value in only 71% of the samples, which occurs mainly (in all but one sample) because the lower bound of the confidence interval exceeds -1( i. e. |𝛽 | &lt; 1). The parameter 𝛿 is imprecisely estimated, and the mean value of its estimate is below its true value. Thus, estimation based on area aggregates in this simple model in which heterogeneity only involves a shifting intercept produces estimates of 𝛽 which is only slightly biased, but its coverage of the true parameter is relatively poor.</p><p>Simulation 3 differs from simulation 2 in allowing the two groups also to differ in their response to price: 𝛽 = -1, 𝛽 = -0.5, 𝛿 = -1.5, 𝛿 = -0.5 and 𝛾 = 0 . Examples of such a form are <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Aksoy (2016)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Dettling and Kearney (2014)</ref>  -2.74 (0.18) * Coverage is the proportion of 95% confidence intervals that contain the true parameter value. . 1 True parameter values: 𝛽 = -0.5, 𝛽 = -1, 𝛾 = 0,𝛿 = 0, 𝛿 = 0.</p><p>2 True parameter values: 𝛽 = -1, 𝛽 = -1, 𝛿 = -1.5, 𝛿 = 0, 𝛾 = 0, 3 True parameter values: 𝛽 = -1, 𝛽 = -0.5, 𝛿 = -1.5, 𝛿 = -0.5, 𝛾 = 0. 4 True parameter values: 𝛽 = -7 𝛽 = -1, 𝛾 = 0.5, 𝛿 = 0, 𝛿 = 0 Simulation 4 introduces individual heterogeneity with a continuous variable, age, but no interaction with 𝑝𝑟𝑖𝑐𝑒 : 𝛽 = -7, 𝛽 = -1, 𝛾 = 0.5, 𝛿 = 𝛿 = 0. What is most striking about the aggregate estimates is that the 95% confidence interval of neither 𝛽 nor 𝛾 ever contains its true value. There is substantial downward bias in the size of both, even though 𝑝𝑟𝑖𝑐𝑒 does not vary over individuals (i.e. is not itself subject to aggregation) and 𝑎𝑔𝑒 and 𝑝𝑟𝑖𝑐𝑒 are uncorrelated. Dropping 𝑎𝑔𝑒 from the aggregate equation does not solve the estimation problem: in the model here, the point estimate 𝛽 =0.46 (SE=0.03) is the same and its 95% confidence interval never contains its true value.</p><p>Simulation 5 address the estimation of the parameters the model in section 2.2 in which the Normality assumptions introduced at the outset of section 2.2 hold by construction. A new variable Xi was added. It was assumed to have a standard Normal distribution and Xa is denoted as its area mean. The true parameters were assumed to be 𝛼 = -0.5, 𝛼 = -1 and 𝛽 = 0.5 𝑜𝑟 0. As the main issue concerns the aggregate estimates, only the Monte Carlo simulations of these are reported in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>: simulation 5A sets 𝛽 = 0 and 5B sets 𝛽 = 0.5. In these two simulations we assume 'limited information' in the sense that the analyst assumes that the latent variable is linear in parameters and its error term is standard Normal, and so we estimate equation (5E). In simulation 5C there are the same two independent variables as in 5B, but it is assumed that the analyst also knows that the distribution of 𝑋 is standard Normal, in which case we should be able to estimate the parameters 𝛼 and 𝛽 consistently by estimating the exact counterpart of equation ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>) by non-linear least squares. This is, of course, a patently unreal situation. -0.52 (0.06) 1 𝛼 = -0.5, 𝛼 = -1, 𝛽 = 0, 'limited information' in estimation, eq'n (5E) 2 𝛼 = -0.5, 𝛼 = -1 , 𝛽 = 0.5, 'limited information' in estimation, eq'n (5E). 3 𝛼 = -0.5, 𝛼 = -1 , 𝛽 = 0.5, 'full information' in estimation, eq'n (5).</p><p>When the independent variables only vary by area (no heterogeneity) equation ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>) indicated that the parameter estimates from the aggregate data using equation (5E) should be consistent. Simulation 5A in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref> indicates that they are indeed unbiased and relatively precise, like in simulation 1.</p><p>In Simulation 5B there is one individual variable with Σ = 𝑣𝑎𝑟(𝑋 𝑖 ) = 1 so that = 𝜷 Σ 𝑥𝑥 𝜷 = 𝛽 . Given the assumed parameter values, 1 + 𝜷 Σ 𝑥𝑥 𝜷 = 1.118. Thus, from equation ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>), we would expect the estimates of 𝑐 and 𝑏 in equation (5E) to be -0.894 and 0.447 and, respectively. This is what we find in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref> when we estimate equation (5E) in which we have 'limited information' about the data information mechanism; thus, the aggregate estimates are biased and understate the size of both parameters 𝛼 and 𝛽 . As in simulation 4, aggregate estimation of a model with an independent variable which varies over individuals produces biased estimates of the price effect. Indeed, in this simulation the 95% confidence interval of 𝛼 never contains its true value.</p><p>Finally, when we assume 'full information' and estimate the exact counterpart of equation ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>) the mean of estimate of 𝛼 is slightly closer to its true value than in simulation 5B and its coverage of the true parameter value is much better, but the estimates of both parameters are not very precise.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Estimation with real data</head><p>Individual panel data from the UK Household Longitudinal Study (Understanding Society) used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Ermisch (2023)</ref> was used to generate estimates of the mean proportion having a birth by each of 10 standard regions in England and Wales for each year of the sample (2010-21) (denoted 𝑦 ). The region by year sample sizes range from 150 to 1,200. The mean 𝑦 (over the 120 year-region combinations) was 0.064 and its mean standard error was 0.011. The aggregate fixed regional effect regressions that follow were weighted by the inverse of a region's mean standard error of 𝑦 over the 12 years. The small proportion of women who change regions between waves are excluded.</p><p>parameters of this model are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">3</ref> in the Individual column. Provided the logistic assumption is correct, these are consistent estimates.</p><p>When using the regional aggregates to estimate the model it is not possible to obtain any reasonable degree of precision if we include all the age interactions with the year variables and the indicators of the London region or the South or East regions (SSE). Thus, these were excluded. The aggregate regression relates ln( ) to the lagged regional house price, lagged regional unemployment rate, mean age, mean age squared, proportion who have a degree, dummy variables for years 2013-16 and 2017-21 and a fixed effect for each region, as in the individual analysis. The aggregate estimates are shown in the Aggregate column of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">3</ref>. Compared to the estimates based on individual data, the estimated size of the house price effect (𝛽 ) is smaller in the regression using the aggregates, although both estimates have relatively large standard errors, making their estimated difference statistically imprecise. Both estimators produce similar point estimates of the unemployment effect (𝛽 ). The estimated impact of having a degree (𝛽 ) is too imprecise to be useful. The analysis of these data concludes with an artificial exercise. According to the individual model there are two sources of variation in the individual birth probability: (1) that arising from variation in the independent variables over time and area (age, house price, etc.) and (2) variation from the random error term in the latent variable equation, which was assumed to have a logistic distribution. The latter source can be excluded by only considering variation in the predicted birth probability 𝑝̂ , which is generated by the estimated parameters and variables in equation ( <ref type="formula">8</ref>). 𝑝̂ was aggregated by region and year to produce 𝑝̂ . The final regression in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">3</ref> uses 𝑝̂ as the dependent variable.<ref type="foot" target="#foot_5">8</ref> Unsurprisingly, the parameter estimates are much more precise than earlier columns because variation in 𝑝̂ is generated solely by the independent variables. Yet aggregation continues to produce lower estimates of the size of 𝛽 , but now higher estimates of the size of 𝛽 and 𝛽 compared to the individual model, particularly the last: the effect of a degree from the aggregate estimates is much larger.</p><p>Even in these favourable circumstances (by construction), the aggregate estimates of the parameters associated with the variables which vary over individuals are not reliable as estimates of influences on individual behaviour when compared with estimates from the individual data.</p></div>

When the model also contains variables that vary across individuals (i.e. there is individual heterogeneity), the Monte Carlo simulations indicate that all parameter estimates based solely on variation in the aggregates usually understate the size of their true value and have poor coverage of the true parameter, a finding that was anticipated by the theoretical arguments leading to equation ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>).
