<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Doing well in school is the first step to success in meritocratic societies that allocate resources and power according to demonstrated achievement. A child's school performance may forecast the number, level, and prestige of the educational qualifications they will attain throughout their lifetime <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> . These educational qualifications will, in turn, inform the child's later access to economic, social, and cultural resources <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> , their position in society <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> , well-being <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> , health <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> , and life expectancy <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> . Yet, children start formal education with unequal opportunities for doing well in school. Children from families with fewer socioeconomic resources tend to lag in school readiness and achieve lower grades in primary and secondary education than children from wellresourced families <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> .</p><p>Prior studies identified the speech children hear from their mothers as a key pathway through which family background inequality in education becomes transmitted <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> . Mothers from underresourced families speak, on average, less frequently to their children <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> , using less diverse vocabulary and simpler syntax than mothers from well-resourced families <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> . Mothers' childdirected lexicon and grammar during the early years predict children's linguistic development (e.g., word segmentation and word mapping) <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> and their school readiness <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> . Yet, little is known about the role of mothers' adult-directed speech, which supersedes child-directed speech by the time children reach the age of 5 years and start formal education <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> . To address this gap, we report the long-term prediction of children's cognition, literacy, and educational achievement at age 5 through to 12 years from mothers' vocabulary sophistication, lexical diversity, and grammatical complexity. We use the term "prediction" in this article to refer to the temporal order in which the assessment of one variable preceded the assessment of another.</p><p>Mothers' speech may contribute to achievement gaps in children's education via two principal mechanisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> that likely intersect. For one, mothers' speech is thought to benefit children's growth in developmental domains that thrive through exposure to language, such as school performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> , the ability to reason and argue logically <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> , and literacy skills <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> . Alternatively, mothers' speech may account for children's degree of familiarity with the linguistic codes that prevail in formal education settings <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> . Children raised without many opportunities to learn these linguistic codes or styles mayunwittinglycommunicate in language patterns that lead to stereotyping, ridicule, discrimination, and exclusion <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> .</p><p>Our study elucidated the role mothers' speech likely plays in transmitting family background inequality in education in four ways. First, we modeled the long-term predictions of mothers' speech for their children's education-related outcomes across the school years. Second, we tested whether mothers' socioeconomic status (SES) was associated with the characteristics of their speech. Third, we explored the extent to which predictions from mothers' speech for children's education-related outcomes were independent of mothers' SES, and then fourth, if mothers' speech mediated the association between mothers' SES and children's educationrelated outcomes.</p><p>We capitalized on rich, naturalistic speech data collected from a socioeconomically diverse sample of N = 894 mothers when their twin children were 5 years old and starting primary school 32 . Data came from E-Risk, a UK population-representative cohort study of families who had twins born from 1994 to 1996 in England and Wales <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> . The mother-child trios in E-Risk were identified via the Office for National Statistics' multi-birth register <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> and represent the full range of Britain's socioeconomic conditions. E-Risk families' residential addresses match the UK Index of Multiple Deprivation distribution: 25% of the families lived in Britain's wealthiest and 25% in the poorest areas <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> . Because E-Risk has suffered minimal attrition since its inception (~5%), in contrast to many other longitudinal studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> , the sample's representativeness remained intact over time.</p><p>Mothers freely described their parenting experiences and the twins' characteristics in interviews conducted in person by trained health researchers <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> (i.e., adult interviewers; average interview length ~22 minutes). From excerpts of these interviews' transcripts, we quantified mothers' lexicon in terms of vocabulary sophistication (% of rare words used in speech <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref> ) and lexical diversity (range of word types used in speech <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref> ). We also quantified mothers' grammatical complexity from the mean length of utterance, verb usage (number of verbs per utterance <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> ) and syntactic complexity (proportion of grammatical relations reflecting complex syntactic structures 39 ). For descriptives and correlations of lexical and grammar markers, see Supplementary Table <ref type="table">1</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>. Children's verbal and non-verbal cognitive abilities at age 5 years and literacy skills (i.e., reading ability) at age 7 and 10 years were assessed with standardized psychometric tests. Children's performance in the core school subjects of English and Mathematics at age 7, 10, and 12 years were rated by teachers relative to that of other pupils at the same age. Using latent growth curve models, we differentiated the variance in children's achievement that was stable from primary through secondary school from the variance in achievement that reflected children's systematic performance gains and losses as they progressed through the school years <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40</ref> . This approach allowed testing whether mothers' speech produced dynamic changes in educational achievement during the school years or if mothers' speech was associated primarily with children's differences in educational achievement that remained unchanged throughout primary and secondary school.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>We fitted hierarchical linear regression models and latent growth curve models using the R package Lavaan <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41</ref> to test if mothers' speech was associated with their SES and predicted their children's cognition, literacy, and educational achievement. To account for the non-independence of observations (i.e., twins), standard errors were clustered at the family level; mothers' age was included as a covariate in all models. E-Risk incurred very low attrition over time (~5%) with data missing randomly; we used Full Information Maximum Likelihood (FIML) in all models <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42</ref> .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Predicting children's cognition and literacy from mothers' speech</head><p>We tested the extent to which mothers' speech predicted children's cognition and literacy concurrently and prospectively at the ages of 5, 7, and 10 years, assessed by standardized psychometric tests <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44</ref> , which in turn forecast their educational achievement <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> . We fitted independent models for each measure at each age with mothers' speech characteristics as predictors.</p><p>Mothers' vocabulary sophistication was significantly and positively associated with children's cognition and literacy (Supplementary Tables <ref type="table">2</ref><ref type="table">3</ref><ref type="table">4</ref>), accounting for 2-5% of the variance across ages and measures (Fig. <ref type="figure">1a</ref>). Neither mothers' lexical diversity nor grammar significantly predicted children's cognition and literacy (Fig. <ref type="figure">1a</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fig 1. Predicting children's cognition and literacy from mothers' speech and SES. Note. Plot A (left) shows the associations between mothers' speech and children's cognition and literacy; Plot B (middle) shows associations between mothers' socioeconomic status (SES) and children's cognition and literacy; Plot C (right) shows the association between mothers' speech and children's cognition and literacy after adjusting for SES. Dots represent standardized (beta) regression estimates, and lines represent 95% confidence intervals. All models were adjusted for mothers' age.</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Predicting children's educational achievement from mothers' speech</head><p>We next tested the extent to which mothers' speech predicted children's school performance in English and Mathematics, as rated by teachers when the children were aged 7, 10, and 12 years. We used latent growth curve models to discern associations between mothers' speech and children's variance in educational achievement that was stable throughout the school years (intercept) versus variance in educational achievement that reflected systematic gains and losses in school performance over time (slope; see Supplementary Note 1). This approach enabled testing whether mothers' lexicon and grammar predicted differences in children's educational achievement that were stable across the school years or predicted dynamic changes in educational achievement over time.</p><p>We specified mothers' speech characteristics (i.e., vocabulary sophistication, lexical diversity, and grammatical complexity) as predictors of the two latent growth factors (i.e., intercept and slope). Mothers' vocabulary sophistication was significantly associated with children's stable variance in educational achievement (intercept), accounting for 2% of the variance, but not with gains and losses in educational achievement over time (slope; Supplementary Table <ref type="table">5</ref>). Thus, mothers' vocabulary sophistication predicted children's achievement differences that persisted throughout school with a small effect size but did not forecast children's improvements or worsening in school performance over time relative to where they started. Mothers' lexical diversity and grammatical complexity were associated neither with the intercept nor the slope of children's educational achievement (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">5</ref>). Akin to our findings on children's cognition and literacy, these results suggest that mothers' vocabulary sophistication predicts children's differences in educational achievement. Yet, mothers' vocabulary sophistication was not associated with changes in achievement trajectories that occur over time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mothers' SES and characteristics of their speech</head><p>To explore the role mothers' speech plays in the transmission of family background inequality, we first tested whether mothers' SES, including their educational attainment, occupation, and household income, was associated with their speech <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45</ref> . We fitted independent regression models for each characteristic of mothers' speech (i.e., vocabulary sophistication, lexical diversity, and grammatical complexity) to be predicted by mothers' SES indicators.</p><p>Mothers' SES indicators accounted for 28% of the variance in vocabulary sophistication and for 6% of the variance in lexical diversity; they were not significantly associated with grammatical complexity (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>, Supplementary Table <ref type="table">6</ref>). These results suggest that only measures of mothers' lexicon (i.e., vocabulary sophistication and lexical diversity) vary as a function of their SES.</p><p>Mothers' educational attainment was the strongest independent correlate of vocabulary sophistication, sharing 9% of the variance, followed by household income and occupation, which each accounted for 5% of the variance. Household income also accounted for 4% of the variance in lexical diversity, but no other significant SES associations with mothers' speech were observed (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">6</ref>). Sensitivity analyses (Supplementary Note 2) showed that the effect sizes were robust after controlling for mothers' scores on the reading subtest of the wide-range achievement test (WRAT-3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46</ref> ). Overall, the findings suggest that mothers' SES is more strongly and consistently associated with their vocabulary sophistication than their lexical diversity and grammar.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fig. 2. Mothers' education, occupation, and household income as predictors of their speech characteristics Note: N = 894. Dots represent standardized regression (beta) estimates from models where mothers' education, occupation, and income were included as simultaneous predictors after adjusting for mothers' age in years. The lines indicate the 95% confidence intervals.</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Predicting children's cognition and literacy from mothers' SES</head><p>Next, we modeled the extent to which mothers' SES predicted children's cognition and literacy (Fig. <ref type="figure">1b</ref>; Supplementary Tables <ref type="table">2</ref><ref type="table">3</ref><ref type="table">4</ref>). Across ages and measures, mothers' SES indicators accounted for 8-10% of the variance in children's cognition and literacy (Fig. <ref type="figure">1b</ref>). Mothers' educational attainment and household income accounted independently for 3-4% of the variance in children's cognition and literacy across ages and measures. Mothers' occupation was not significantly associated with children's cognition and literacy at any age.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Predicting children's educational achievement from mothers' SES</head><p>Mothers' educational attainment and household income, respectively, accounted for 9% and 14% of children's stable variance in educational achievement (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">5</ref>) but were not associated with changes in achievement (slope) across the school years. Mothers' occupation was not significantly associated with children's educational achievement. Our findings suggest that mothers' educational attainment and household income can predict children's differences in performance that are already evident at the start of schooling but not relative changes in achievement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discerning predictions from mothers' speech versus SES for children's cognition and literacy</head><p>Next, we tested the extent to which our previously observed associations between mothers' vocabulary sophistication and children's cognition and literacy could be attributed to SES (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>; Supplementary Tables <ref type="table">2</ref><ref type="table">3</ref><ref type="table">4</ref>). Associations between mothers' vocabulary sophistication and children's cognition and literacy remained significant but halved in effect size (i.e., 1-2%) after adding mothers' SES to the models. These findings suggest that associations of mothers' SES with children's cognition and literacy are likely more pervasive than those with mothers' vocabulary sophistication. Our sensitivity analyses (see Supplementary Note 2) confirmed that the observed associations were robust and independent of covariate effects. We observed no differences in the associations between mothers' lexical diversity and grammar with children's cognition and literacy, which were non-significant before and after adding mothers' SES to the models.</p><p>To explore if mothers' vocabulary sophistication mediated associations between SES and children's cognition and literacy (Fig. <ref type="figure">3A</ref>), we specified mothers' vocabulary sophistication as a mediator and mothers' education and household income as predictors (Fig. <ref type="figure">3A</ref>). The latter were significantly associated with children's cognition and literacy in our earlier analyses, which is a pre-requisite for fitting mediation models <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47</ref> (see Supplementary Note 3 for full details).</p><p>Mothers' vocabulary sophistication significantly mediated the association between mothers' educational attainment and children's verbal (ßm * = 0.04, 95% CI= 0.01-0.07) and non-verbal skills at age 5 (ßm = 0.03, 95% CI= 0.01-0.05) as well as their literacy skills at age 10 (ßm = 0.03, 95% CI= 0.01-0.06). At age 7, the mediation for literacy skills was not significant (ßm = 0.02, 95% CI= -0.01-0.05; Fig. <ref type="figure">3B</ref> and Supplementary Table <ref type="table">7</ref>). Mothers' vocabulary sophistication significantly mediated the association between household income and children's verbal (ßm = 0.03, 95% CI= 0.01-0.05) and non-verbal skills at age 5 (ßm = 0.02, 95% CI= 0.01-0.04), and their literacy skills at age 10 (ßm = 0.02, 95% CI= 0.01-0.05), but not at age 7 (ßm = 0.02, 95% CI= -0.01-0.05).</p><p>Effect sizes for the significant mediations were small, ranging from 13% to 24% of the associations between SES and children's cognition and literacy, with models accounting for 11% to 8% of the variance (i.e., absolute mediation effect sizes were 3% to 1%; full model results in Supplementary Table <ref type="table">7</ref>). These results suggest that mothers' vocabulary sophistication partly explains the associations between mothers' educational attainment and household income with children's cognition and literacy, albeit with modest effect sizes and inconsistently across measures.</p></div>

Bottom panel (B) shows the direct and mediated estimates (betas transformed into % of variance explained by indirect effect) with 95% bootstrapped confidence intervals from 1000 resamples for mothers' vocabulary sophistication (mediator), separately for mothers' education and household income (predictors) cognition, literacy, and educational achievement (outcomes).</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discerning predictions from mothers' speech versus SES for children's educational achievement</head><p>We tested the extent to which associations between mothers' vocabulary sophistication and children's stable variance in educational achievement could be attributed to SES (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">6</ref>). Associations between mothers' vocabulary sophistication and children's educational achievement became non-significant after adding mothers' SES to the models, suggesting again that associations between mothers' SES and children's educational achievement are likely more pervasive than those with mothers' vocabulary sophistication.</p><p>Because mothers' vocabulary sophistication was independently a significant predictor of children's stable variance in educational achievement, the pre-requisite for testing mediation was met. We specified mothers' vocabulary sophistication to mediate the associations between their educational attainment or household income and their children's educational achievement. Mothers' vocabulary sophistication mediated neither association (educational attainment : ßm = 0.01, 95% CI= -0.01-0.04; household income: ßm = 0.01, 95% CI = -0.01-0.03; Fig. <ref type="figure">3B</ref>; Supplementary Table <ref type="table">7</ref>). Above, we found that mothers' vocabulary sophistication mediated the relationship between mothers' SES and children's cognition and literacy. Yet, for educational achievement, the mediations were not significant. This discrepancy in results suggests that mothers' vocabulary sophistication may play a different role in children's development of cognition and literacy as compared to their educational achievement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>The language environments children experience during their early years likely drive the transmission of family background inequality in education <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48</ref> . Previous research conceptualized these early life language environments primarily in terms of mothers' child-directed speech <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> , which facilitates children's initial acquisition of language <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> . Many empirical studies reported significant associations between mothers' child-directed speech and children's vocabulary <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref> and grammar <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> during the early years. Yet, our study is the first to test whether mothers' adultdirected speech predicts children's long-term cognition, literacy, and educational achievement across primary and secondary school years.</p><p>Our study's findings may explain why interventions that target mothers' speech to disrupt family background inequality in education often show only short-term benefits <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50</ref> . In 894 families drawn from a UK-representative longitudinal cohort study, we observed that mothers' vocabulary sophistication accounted for 2% of the variance in children's educational achievement across school years. This small effect became non-significant after taking into consideration mothers' educational attainment and household income, suggesting that mothers' vocabulary sophistication does not share pervasive associations with children's educational achievement. Educational attainment and household income reflect mothers' relative access to and availability of socioeconomic resources <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52</ref> and ability to invest in child-specific learning activities <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53</ref> . Respectively, they explained 9% and 14% of children's differences in educational achievement, a fivefold greater effect than that observed for mothers' vocabulary sophistication.</p><p>We contend that mothers' child-directed speech predicts children's language abilities during the early years <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">55</ref> and that these early language abilities aid children's education-related outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> . However, our findings here and elsewhere <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">56</ref> challenge the hypothesis that mothers' speech exerts significant influence on children's educational achievement after they have started formal education. Past research on the transmission of family background inequality in education may have focused too narrowly <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">57</ref> on the role of mothers' speech at the cost of studying alternative linguistic <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> and non-linguistic pathways <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref> that likely carry equal, if not greater, explanatory power. Intervention efforts based on this narrow research may have attributedinadvertentlytoo much responsibility to mothers' speech for children's educational successes and failures <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">61</ref> . Such misattributions can reinforce narratives that mothers, rather than the social and economic conditions in which they raise their children, are at the root of children's educational achievement differences <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">57,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">62,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">63</ref> .</p><p>Our findings also challenge the idea that mothers' speech differences are shaped by the 'social gradient', a widely observed phenomenon in which people with fewer socioeconomic resources are at increased risk of less favorable outcomes (e.g., worse speech) relative to people with greater resources <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">64</ref> . We found small associations between mothers' SES and their vocabulary sophistication and lexical diversity, and no significant association with their grammatical complexity. These findings align with analyses of other large-scale cohorts <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">65,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">66</ref> and meta-analytic studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">67,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">68</ref> but contradict some earlier reports of dramatic SES-related differences in mothers' speech in smaller samples <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">69</ref> . Characteristics of mothers' speech other than the ones studied here may converge on the social gradient, such as dialect <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">70</ref> , word pronunciation <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">71</ref> , and narrative construction <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">72</ref> . Yet, we found little evidence in the current analyses that vocabulary sophistication, lexical diversity, and grammatical complexity, which are typical markers of adultdirected speech, covaried systematically with education, occupation, and household income that are typical markers of SES.</p><p>Our overall finding was that mothers' speech likely plays a modest role in children's cognition, literacy, and educational achievement beyond the early years. In addition, two notable observations emerged. First, among the three characteristics of mothers' speech studied here, vocabulary sophistication (i.e., % of rare words <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref> ) was the most consistent predictor of children's education-related outcomes. It was also the speech characteristic most strongly associated with mothers' SES. The potential influence of mothers' vocabulary sophistication on children's vocabulary development has been previously noted <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">73</ref> . However, the exact pathways and mechanisms through which mothers' vocabulary sophistication may inform children's developmental differences in education-related outcomes are, to date, unknown <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">74,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">75</ref> . That said, vocabulary sophistication is believed to benefit children's learning from academic texts, which become increasingly abstract, complex, and dense across school years <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">76,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">77</ref> . Thus, our findings lend some support to calls for classroom environments that encourage engaging with sophisticated vocabulary that is aligned with the complexity of the academic texts that pupils study <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">78</ref> .</p><p>Second, we found that mothers' vocabulary sophistication predicted children's cognition and literacy more strongly than children's educational achievement in two ways. For one, mothers' vocabulary sophistication continued to predict children's cognition and literacy after considering mothers' educational attainment and household income, while its prediction of educational achievement became nonsignificant. For the other, mothers' vocabulary sophistication partly mediated associations between mothers' educational attainment and household income with children's cognition and literacy but not with children's educational achievement. Cognition and literacy are narrow skills that inform educational achievement <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">79,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">80</ref> . Educational achievement is a broad skill encompassing many other factors, such as school attendance, study habits, and classroom behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">81,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">82</ref> . Mothers' vocabulary sophistication may have direct benefits for the development of cognition and literacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">79,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">83,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">84</ref> that we could observe here. By comparison, its influences on educational achievement may be more indirect <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">85</ref> and, thus, were masked in the current analyses.</p><p>Our study has many strengths, including rich observational data across a 7-year follow-up period from a large sample representative of the full range of Britain's socioeconomic conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">86</ref> . Yet, it is not without limitations. First, because no measures of mothers' child-directed speech were available, comparing the lexical and grammatical complexity in mothers' child-versus adultdirected speech <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">87</ref> and respective associations with children's education-related outcomes was impossible. Child-directed speech is likely pivotal for children's language acquisition during the early years <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> , but its long-term influences on children's educational trajectories have not been studied, a gap that future research should address. Second, our study focused only on mothers' speech but no data were available on the speech of fathers, teachers, and peers, which may also influence children's language development and education-related outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[88]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">[89]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">[90]</ref> . Thus, our analyses allow inferring conclusions about the role of mothers' speech in the transmission of family background inequality in education but not about children's broader speech environments. Third, while our study's data are comparatively rich, they were collected infrequently (i.e., at varying time windows between 2 to 5 years) up to the beginning of secondary school, assessing some learning skills (i.e., cognition and literacy) but not others (e.g., self-regulation, numeracy). We therefore caution that, while our findings are clear and consistent, future research needs to replicate and extend them.</p><p>Our findings suggest that mothers' education and household income can exert greater long-term influence on their children's education-related outcomes than the characteristics of mothers' speech. Intervention efforts that seek to disrupt the perpetuation of family background inequality in education should consider a broad range of possible transmission pathways, rather than attributing the responsibility for children's educational outcomes disproportionately to how mothers speak. Pedagogical approaches at the classroom level <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">91</ref> that enable all children to maximize the learning opportunities that school affords them, regardless of their cognition and literacy skills at school entry or their families' socioeconomic resources, may be more effective for reducing family background inequality in education <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">63,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">92</ref> than modifying children's home language experiences. A first step to effectively reducing family background inequality in education is recognizing that achievement gaps emerge and manifest in the context of wider, systemic discriminations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Materials and Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample</head><p>Data came from the Environmental Risk (E-Risk) Longitudinal Twin Study, which tracks the development of 2,232 British twin children drawn from a larger birth register of twins born in England and Wales in 1994 and 1995 <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">93</ref> . Full details about the sample are reported elsewhere <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> and in Supplementary Note 4. To summarize, the E-Risk sample was constructed in 1999 to 2000 when 1,116 families (93% of those eligible and of whom 90.4% were Caucasian) with same-sex 5-year-old twins participated in home-visit assessments. This sample comprised 56% monozygotic and 44% dizygotic twin pairs; sex was evenly distributed within zygosity (49% male). Families were recruited to represent the UK population of families with newborns in the 1990s, on the basis of residential location throughout England and Wales and mothers' age (i.e., older mothers twins via assisted reproduction were under-selected and teenage mothers with twins were over-selected). This resulted in a sample of families which were representative of the distribution of neighborhood socio-economic status across the UK population <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">94</ref> .</p><p>Follow-up home visits were conducted when children were aged 7, 10, 12, and 18 years (participation rates were 98%, 96%, 96%, and 93%, respectively). Here we use data collected up to age 12 when 1073 families participated. Home visits at ages 5, 7, 10, and 12 years included assessments with participants and their mother (or primary caregiver); a different interviewer assessed each participant in a twin pair. With parents' permission, questionnaires were posted to the children's teachers, who returned questionnaires for 94% of children at age 5, 91% of the 2,232 E-Risk children (93% of those followed up) at age 7, 86.3% of the 2,232 E-Risk children (90.1% of those followed up) at age 10, and 80% of the 2,232 E-Risk children at age 12 (83% of those followed up). The Joint South London and Maudsley and Institute of Psychiatry Research Ethics Committee approved each study phase. Parents gave informed consent and twins gave assent between 5 and 12 years and then informed consent at age 18.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mothers' speech corpus</head><p>When their twin children were 5 years old, mothers were asked to speak for 5 to 10 minutes about each of the children separately during home visit assessments <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> . Mothers were encouraged to talk freely with few interruptions. However, if a mother found this difficult, the interviewer could aid her with a series of semi-structured probes, such as 'In what ways would you like [child] to be different?'. Interviews about each twin were separated in time by approximately 90 minutes. All interviews were audiotaped with the mothers' consent. Interview data was missing for 6% of the sample because some mothers did not wish to be audiotaped, because of technical problems with the tape, or because of loss to follow-up. The audio-taped interviews were transcribed, and 10-minute samples from each interview (to ensure comparability given the varying interview lengths) were coded for automatic analyses using the Computer Language Analysis (CLAN) program <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">95</ref> . A further 1% of interviews were excluded at the transcription stage due to poor audio. 2% of families were then excluded because a language other than English was spoken at home. Our final analysis sample included all mothers and their twins for whom sufficient speech data was available (i.e., 1,788 children from 894 families).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mothers' speech characteristics</head><p>From the transcripts of mothers' speech, we extracted quantitative markers of lexicon and grammar using the FREQ, VOCD, and MLU programs within CLAN <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">95</ref> . For lexical markers, we extracted mothers' vocabulary sophistication and lexical diversity. For grammar markers, we extracted mothers' mean length of utterance (morpheme count), grammatical complexity index, and verb usage within utterances. When extracting grammar markers, partially unintelligible utterances were excluded.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Vocabulary sophistication</head><p>Vocabulary sophistication was the percentage of rare words mothers used in their respective speech transcripts. From the transcripts, we removed all words on the Dale-Chall word list (79), their inflected forms, all non-dictionary words, and any derivations of family names. The Dale-Chall word list <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">96</ref> includes the 3,000 most common words known by fourth graders. Any remaining words in the transcripts were considered rare and sophisticated word types <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref> . The percentage of mothers' rare word types relative to their total number of word types in the transcript was then calculated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Lexical diversity</head><p>Lexical diversity was measured by computing D scores, which index the probability of introducing a new word as the speech sample progresses <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">95</ref> . D-scores are highly robust against sample size effects and thus constitute reliable markers of lexical diversity over other methods such as Type Token Ratio <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">97,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">98</ref> .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Grammatical complexity</head><p>Grammatical complexity was inferred from the grammatical complexity index (GCI) <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39</ref> , verb index, and mean length of utterance <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> .</p><p>GCI was computed by calculating mothers' total number of grammatical relations that marked syntactic embeddings divided by their total number of grammatical relations 39,99the higher the index, the more complex grammatical and syntactic structures used in speech. The verb index was the mothers' total number of verbs divided by the total number of utterances. The higher the average number of verbs per utterance, the more complex the syntax. MLU was calculated by dividing mothers' total number of morphemes by their total number of utterances produced. The higher the MLU, the more complex and longer a person's utterances. Any words classed as communicators, such as 'oh' or 'ah', were excluded from this analysis.</p><p>Preliminary analyses were carried out to validate the reliability of the characteristics of mothers' speech. Our lexical markers (vocabulary sophistication and lexical diversity) were positively intercorrelated at r = .34, and our grammar markers (MLU, grammatical complexity, and verb usage) correlated between .79 and .91. Because the grammar markers' correlations were above .60, we computed a grammar composite score by summing the z-scores for grammatical complexity, MLU, and verb usage, in line with our pre-registration. All our speech markers correlated positively with the mothers' reading scores from the Wide-Range Achievement Test (WRAT-3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46</ref> ). Mothers' complexity of speech and score on WRAT-3 have been shown elsewhere 100 to be highly correlated, which aligns with our findings here.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SES indicators</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mothers' educational attainment</head><p>The highest educational qualification of mothers when the children were aged 5 were coded into 5 groups (1= No Qualifications; 2 = Certificate of Secondary Education (2-5)/General Certificate of Secondary Education (D-G), i.e. below average school leaving qualification; 3= Certificate of Secondary Education (1)/O Level (A-C)/ General Certificate of Secondary Education (A-C), i.e. above average school qualification; 4= Advanced Level/Scholarship Level; 5=Higher National Certificate/Degree i.e., College Level Qualification; 6= Higher National Diploma/Postgraduate degree).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mothers' occupation</head><p>The mothers' current (or most recent) occupation when the children were aged 5 were coded using the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys (1991) Standard Occupational Classification. Occupational groups are arranged into six social classes (1=professional occupations; 2=managerial and technical occupations; 3=skilled occupations (non-manual); 4=skilled occupations (manual); 5=partly skilled occupations; 6=unskilled occupations).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Household income</head><p>Mothers reported the household's total income from all sources before tax in the previous 12 months when the children were aged 5. Families were then coded into 16 income brackets, the lowest bracket representing an annual income of £10,000 or less and the highest representing an annual income of £40,000 or more.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cognition and literacy</head><p>Verbal and non-verbal ability A short form of the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence-Revised <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44</ref> was used to assess the cognitive ability of young children at age 5 years. Two subtests were administered: a score on the Vocabulary Subtest taken as a measure of verbal ability and a score on the Block Design subtest taken as a measure of non-verbal ability. All raw scores were converted to agebased standard scores.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reading score</head><p>Children completed The Sight Word Efficiency (SWE) subtest of the Test of Word Reading Efficiency (TOWRE), which measures a child's ability to pronounce printed words accurately and fluently <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43</ref> . The SWE was administered at ages 7 and 10 years to assess the number of real printed words that children can identify accurately within 45 seconds. All raw scores were converted to age-based standard scores.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Educational achievement</head><p>Teachers rated the children's performance in English and Mathematics when the twins were aged 7, 10, and 12 years. Teachers compared the target child's performance to that of a typical student of the same age on a 5-point Likert scale (1=Far Below, 2=Somewhat Below, 3=Average, 4=Somewhat Above, 5=Far Above). We initially fitted our latent growth curve models separately for English and Mathematics, but because the pattern of results was interchangeable across subjects, we reported models with summed performance scores in our main manuscript (independent models for English and Mathematics are reported in Supplementary Table <ref type="table">8</ref>).</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><graphic coords="5,90.00,333.11,480.39,200.30" type="bitmap" /></figure>
