<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Research on social media's impact on adolescent mental health has yielded inconsistent findings, and many demographic moderators have been investigated to little effect. We move beyond such comparisons to examine how cognitive processes might shape this relationship. In a pre-registered longitudinal study, we applied computational modelling to repeated decision-making tasks to test whether preference for immediate rewards moderates the longitudinal relationship between social media use and mental health. Adolescents with a greater preference for immediate rewards exhibited larger declines in behavioural activation as social media use increased. This effect was consistent across timepoints, indicating heightened vulnerability among those favouring immediate gratification. No moderation was observed for other mental health outcomes, and delay discounting was unrelated to time spent on social media or compulsive internet use. Cognitive processes could therefore provide insights into individual differences in social media's mental health effects, offering future mechanistic explanations and potential targets for intervention.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Social media shapes the lives of many adolescents, and the growing concerns about the psychological implications of this development outpace the provision of conclusive scientific evidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Orben &amp; Matias, 2025)</ref>. Across the population, studies tend to find small negative correlations between social media use and mental health and wellbeing <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Fassi et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Ivie et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Keles et al., 2020)</ref>. However, the evidence suggests that these associations differ markedly across individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(Valkenburg et al., 2021</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Valkenburg et al., , 2024))</ref>. Subsequent efforts have therefore attempted to determine which individual differences (enduring characteristics that distinguish people from one another) predict risk or resilience to the effects of social media. This includes, for example, age <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Crone &amp; Konijn, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Orben et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Orben &amp; Blakemore, 2023)</ref>, gender <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Booker et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Coyne et al., 2023)</ref>, and socioeconomic status <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Kurten et al., 2025)</ref>.</p><p>Despite theoretical reasons why high-level demographic differences, such as age, might moderate the relationship between social media use and mental health, empirical support for these moderations has been mixed <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Booker et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Cunningham et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Orben et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Vahedi &amp; Zannella, 2021)</ref>. This inconsistency may stem from the predominant focus on broad demographic categories as isolated predictors, overlooking how these interact with the underlying psychological and biological processes that drive cognition and behaviour.</p><p>Individual differences likely operate hierarchically across three interconnected levels: broad macro-level factors such as demographics (e.g. age), nuanced mesolevel cognitive mechanisms (reward learning processes that determine how individuals learn from rewards), and fine-grained micro-level biological processes that implement these cognitive mechanisms in the brain or body (e.g. neural networks)(see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Macro-level factors tend to be structural or demographic in nature and are often measured via self-report or administrative data, which provide a high-level lens for examining population differences. Meso-level factors, by contrast, capture the cognitive, behavioural and biological mechanisms that vary both between individuals and within individuals over time, determining how individuals process information, make decisions, and respond to their environment. Micro-level factors represent the biological implementations of these processes. Crucially, these levels are interconnected, and meso-level mechanisms may covary with higher-order macro-level differences. For example, age-related differences in the association between social media use and mental health may be explained by underlying differences in reward sensitivity -a meso-level cognitive mechanism that changes across development and determines how individuals pursue rewards in their environment.</p><p>This hierarchical framework may help explain why previous research, which has predominantly examined macro-level individual differences, has produced heterogeneous findings. Macro-level measures may obscure meaningful patterns by aggregating distinct meso-level processes that differentially relate to outcomes of interest. This pattern is evidence in clinical research, where findings have suggested that while age and gender (macro-level factors) fail to predict antidepressant treatment outcomes, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis functioning -a meso-level neurocognitive process -helps predict patient treatment response <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Ising et al., 2007)</ref>. Similarly, in social media research, age alone may mask important differences in underlying cognitive processes and their influence on the effects of social media use on mental health. This illustrates the importance of targeting lower-level (i.e. micro-and meso-level) for understanding, predicting, and treating the complex link between social media use and mental health outcomes.</p><p>Research across the mental health field has largely recognised the importance of meso-level processes for effective mechanistic research. Within the field of computational psychiatry, researchers use mathematical models of cognition and behaviour to formalise and test the meso-level mechanisms that underpin mental health, enabling more precise quantification of these nuanced processes.</p><p>This mathematical approach has enabled researchers to examine detailed neurocognitive processes that are implicated in the onset, maintenance, and treatment of mental distress <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Browning et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Montague et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Stern et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Wise et al., 2023)</ref>.</p><p>Building on these advances from mental health research, a cognitivecomputational approach can potentially provide a valuable lens for examining the nuanced meso-level factors of risk and resilience for the relationship between social media use and mental health. Cognitive processes -including impulsivity, reward learning, and attention -shape a) how individuals seek and process information <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Kelly &amp; Sharot, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Sharot &amp; Sunstein, 2020)</ref>, b) how individuals interpret and learn from their experiences <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Poulton &amp; Hester, 2020)</ref>, and c) how these experiences relate to downstream emotional and behavioural consequences <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Amlung et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Pike &amp; Robinson, 2022)</ref>. It is eminently plausible that these influences are not limited to offline environments and that cognitive processes systematically shape how social media affects individuals. Therefore, a meso-level approach investigating cognitive individual differences in risk and resilience can potentially provide an effective framework for studying the impacts of social media on mental health. Among the numerous potential cognitive processes of interest, one process that has been implicated across a range of mental health conditions is delay discounting <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Amlung et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Lempert et al., 2019)</ref>, a measure of impulsive preference for smaller, immediate rewards over larger, delayed rewards <ref type="bibr">(da Matta et al., 2012)</ref>. Steeper discounting of delayed rewards -meaning a stronger preference for immediate rewards -has been associated with addictive disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Bickel et al., 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Bickel et al., , 2014))</ref>, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder <ref type="bibr">(Jackson &amp; MacKillop, 2016)</ref>, and eating-related disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Amlung et al., 2016)</ref>. Therefore, scholars have proposed delay discounting as a transdiagnostic process involved in psychiatric conditions that provides insights into the underlying features of a range of disorders and marks a meaningful treatment target <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Amlung et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Levin et al., 2018)</ref>. Moreover, delay discounting varies across age <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Achterberg et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Lu et al., 2023)</ref> and gender <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Lv et al., 2025)</ref>. Individuals who exhibit steeper discounting may gravitate towards experiences that promise more proximal rewards, such as short-form entertainment, rather than pursuing long-term rewarding outcomes, such as social connection <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Endert &amp; Mohr, 2020)</ref>. Therefore, delay discounting may shape how users interact with and are affected by their online experiences. For instance, users who seek long-term rewards may foster meaningful interactions that contribute to their overall wellbeing, whereas users in pursuit of immediate rewards may be more vulnerable to potential negative effects of social media.</p><p>The present pre-registered study examines this premise using a unique combination of a large longitudinal dataset of adolescents and rich cognitive task data concerning delay discounting, which develops across adolescence and has been linked to a range of mental health outcomes. Specifically, we investigate whether individual differences in delay discounting moderate the relationship between social media use and mental health outcomes over time, as well as whether it relates to time spent social media and compulsive internet use. In doing so, we illustrate how researching nuanced cognitive processes can further our understanding of the mechanisms linking social media use and mental health and generate testable pathways of risk and resilience to the mental health effects of social media use.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample characteristics</head><p>We analysed data from 512 children part of the seven-year Leiden Consortium on Individual Development longitudinal twin study <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Crone et al., 2020)</ref>. Participants were aged 7-9 at baseline and completed annual measurements for seven years. The data available at the seven measurement occasions are presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. The included mental health, social media use, and behavioural task measures are presented in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>, and a detailed overview of all measurements and their timings is available online <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Crone et al., 2020)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Longitudinal models of social media use and mental health outcomes</head><p>We proceeded to investigate the bidirectional within-person developmental associations between social media use and various mental health outcomes. The models decomposed stable between-person differences from within-person fluctuations, allowing us to test how deviations from one's average levels in social media use relate to subsequent changes in mental health and vice versa.</p><p>Specifically, we were interested in the extent to which individual differences in delay discounting moderated these within-subject longitudinal associations.</p><p>We pre-registered the longitudinal models for the following mental health outcomes: Behavioural Inhibition and Activation System scale (BIS/BAS; <ref type="bibr">Carver &amp; White, 1994)</ref>, the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ; <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Goodman, 1997</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Goodman, , 2001))</ref>, the Highly Sensitive Child Scale (HSC; <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Pluess et al., 2018)</ref>, and the effortful control subscale of the Early Adolescent Temperament questionnaire (EATQ-EC; <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Capaldi &amp; Rothbart, 1992)</ref>. The BIS/BAS scale is a 20-item self-report measure of individual differences in responsiveness to non-reward punishment (BIS; Cronbach's alpha = 0.81) and sensitivity to reward and approach-related behaviour (BAS;</p><p>Cronbach's alpha = .84). People with high BIS are more likely to feel anxious or worried, potentially avoiding situations that could lead to punishment or unpleasant experiences <ref type="bibr">(Carver &amp; White, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Svihra &amp; Katzman, 2004)</ref>; in contrast people with high BAS are more likely to be energetic and driven to seek out new experiences or rewards <ref type="bibr">(Carver &amp; White, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Karimpour-Vazifehkhorani et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">McFarland et al., 2006)</ref>.</p><p>The scale has been validated across studies, and evidence has supported both BIS and BAS as separate unidimensional measures <ref type="bibr">(Carver &amp; White, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr">Jorm et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr">Maack &amp; Ebesutani, 2018)</ref>. Prior to conducting the analyses, we deviated from the preregistration and decided to analyse the BIS and BAS subscales separately. This deviation was required to correct an error in the preregistration, where we proposed to analyse it as one concept, which would have failed to draw psychometrically and theoretically valid conclusions. Given that these systems are not opposite extremes on a continuum but orthogonal constructs, analyses on the total score would have obscured meaningful patterns and produced uninterpretable results. This matches standard practice in the literature, which consistently treats the subscales as separate outcomes <ref type="bibr">(Jorm et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr">Maack &amp; Ebesutani, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">Quilty &amp; Oakman, 2004)</ref>.</p><p>The SDQ scale is a widely used 25-item measure of child mental health and assesses psychological difficulties across five domains. The total score indicates overall psychological difficulties and is internally consistent (Cronbach's alpha: 0.73) and relatively stable across time <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Goodman, 1997</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Goodman, , 2001;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Goodman et al., 2000)</ref>. The HSC is a 27-item measure of environmental sensitivity with acceptable internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.69; <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Pluess et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Weyn et al., 2021)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Baseline Random Intercept Cross-lagged Panel Models</head><p>To examine the relationship between social media use and mental health, we fit five baseline models. An overview and visualisations of the model estimates are presented in Supplement 4 (Table <ref type="table">S1</ref>, Fig. <ref type="figure">S5</ref>, S6a -S9a). The significant effects for each model are presented below.</p><p>All five baseline models had good fit (CFIs = 1.000, 90% CIs [&gt;0.934, 1.000],</p><p>TLIs = 1.000, 90% CIs [&gt;0.522, 1.000], RMSEAs = 0.000, 90% CIs [0.000, &lt;0.111]), with stable convergence (Potential Scale Reduction (PSR) values &lt; 1.100). Withinperson reciprocal associations between social media use and mental health were non-significant across all baseline models (all ps &gt; 0.062). We found positive autoregressive effects for social media use between measurement points five and six across all baseline models (all ps &lt; 0.025, all βs &gt; 0.349). Moreover, we observed positive autoregressive effects for mental health measures at timepoints five and six for BIS (β = 0.295, p = 0.032), BAS (β = 0.323, p = 0.007), and HSCS (β = 0.373, p = 0.001). The only cross-sectional association between social media use and a mental health outcome observed was the positive association between social media use and EATQ-EC scores at measurement occasion six (β = 0.253, p = 0.013).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Moderation models of delay discounting</head><p>To examine whether individual differences in delay discounting moderated the relationship between social media use and mental health, we added delay discounting estimates as moderators to the cross-lagged panel models. We applied the delay discounting estimates from each measurement occasion to moderate the cross-lagged paths originating from that same timepoint. For example, delay discounting measured at timepoint five moderated the path from social media use at timepoint five to mental health outcome at timepoint six. This approach allowed us to test whether within-subject lagged associations from social media use to mental health varied depending on the level of delay discounting. Below, we examine the results for each mental health outcome separately. An overview and visualisations of the model estimates are presented in Supplement 4 and Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> below (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">S2</ref>, Fig.</p><p>S6b -S9b)..</p><p>Our findings indicated no relationship between between-person differences in delay discounting and cross-lagged associations between social media use and BIS (p = 0.402), SDQ (p = 0.428), HSCS (p = 0.211), and EATQ-EC (p = 0.241). We therefore did not find evidence that delay discounting is a potential risk factor for negative social media effects on these four mental health outcomes.</p><p>For the Behavioural Activation Subscale, we observed a negative crosslagged relationship between social media use and behavioural activation (β5-6 = -0.198, p5-6 = 0.038; β6-7 = -0.065, p6-7 = 0.353) when adding the moderator delay discounting (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>). Therefore, individuals who scored below their model-predicted amount of social media use showed lower behavioural activation in the subsequent year, i.e. they are less driven to pursue goals or pleasurable experiences and may thus experience less positive affect <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Kasch et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">McFarland et al., 2006)</ref>. This </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>The mechanisms that underlie individual susceptibility to social media's mental health effects remain poorly understood. Cognitive processes have the potential to underlie individuals' risk or resilience to experiencing negative mental health outcomes on social media, but have remained largely unexplored. In the first study of its kind, we therefore tested whether delay discounting -a cognitive process reflecting preference for immediate versus delayed rewards -moderates longitudinal associations between social media use and mental health outcomes in over 500 adolescents across three measurement occasions. We also conducted exploratory analyses examining direct relationships between delay discounting and both social media engagement and compulsive internet use.</p><p>Across five mental health outcomes examined, we found one significant moderation effect of delay discounting. Specifically, higher social media use predicted decreases in behavioural activation (i.e. approach-related motivation and behaviour), and this negative association was stronger among individuals who showed a stronger preference for immediate rewards. This pattern suggests that individuals who prefer immediate rewards may be more susceptible to the negative mental health effects of social media use, as deficits in approach-oriented behaviour (i.e. not seeking out rewarding experiences) have been associated with the onset and maintenance of mental health conditions, including depression <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Hasler et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Kasch et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Markarian et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">McFarland et al., 2006)</ref>.</p><p>However, we did not find delay discounting to moderate the relationship between social media use and the remaining four mental health outcomes. A possible explanation for these mixed findings is that delay discounting may be of particular relevance to the relationship between social media use and approach motivation for reward-related outcomes. Previous studies have illustrated the importance of reward learning for explaining social media engagement <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Lindström et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Turner et al., 2024)</ref>, which may subsequently affect user wellbeing.</p><p>However, the mixed nature of our findings calls for caution, and more research will be required to establish the robustness of the observed findings.</p><p>We further examined the direct relationship between delay discounting and social media use and compulsive internet use. Our findings indicate no differences in time spent on social media or compulsiveness of internet use as a function of differences in delay discounting. Whereas some studies have reported a direct relationship between delay discounting and time spent on social media <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Endert &amp; Mohr, 2020)</ref>, previous research has only been completed on adult samples. More generally, it is plausible that cognitive processes operate through more complex mechanisms that determine the qualitatively different usage patterns that go beyond the mere amount of consumption <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Parry et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Turel et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>The present research takes an innovative approach to studying the relationship between social media use and mental health that capitalises on advances in computational and longitudinal modelling of human behaviour. It represents the first attempt to examine individual differences in the relationship between social media use and mental health through the lens of meso-level cognitive processes. We used some of the best longitudinal data available, which spanned critical developmental periods of adolescence and enabled us to examine the influence of cognitive processes on the bidirectional relationship between social media use and mental health. Our computational approach was integrated into longitudinal models to estimate individual differences in cognitive processes that could provide nuanced insights. Contrasting previous research attempting to characterise risk and resilience to the effects of social media use on mental health, the present findings constitute the first evidence suggesting that individual differences in fundamental cognitive processes have the potential to generate compelling insights into the mechanisms underlying the relationship between social media use and mental health outcomes. This research opens new avenues for understanding and potentially intervening in the complex relationship between digital technologies and adolescent mental health.</p><p>Our findings and their implications for future research should however be considered in light of two main limitations. First, the measurement of individual differences in cognitive processes is a contentious issue in the field of computational psychiatry. Although a computational approach has allowed for the identification of latent cognitive processes, heterogeneous task design and implementation have raised concerns about the specificity and sensitivity of parameter estimates to realworld outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bailey et al., 2021)</ref>. However, previous studies have reported acceptable or strong temporal stability of delay discounting estimates in both child <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Burns et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Klein et al., 2022)</ref> and adolescent samples <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Gelino et al., 2024)</ref>.</p><p>Measurement-related properties are important to consider when attempting to extend the presented framework to other cognitive processes. Moreover, the present findings were based on the discounting of monetary rewards, whereas previous research has indicated that discounting of social rewards may be more relevant in moderating relationships between social processes and affective outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Hill et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Pegg et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Politte-Corn et al., 2024)</ref>. Future studies may expand on the present findings by examining cognitive processes within social decision-making contexts.</p><p>Another limitation of the findings follows from delays between measurement occasions. Whereas the present results are based on annual measurements, it is plausible that the time scales at which cognitive processes exert their influences on user behaviour and mental health are shorter. Studies that involve shorter intervals between measurements may provide important further insights into the dynamics of social media use and mental health, and the extent to which these dynamics are shaped by individual differences in cognitive processes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>Previous attempts to understand individual differences in mental health outcomes of social media use have focused on macro-level differences such as age or gender.</p><p>While demographic variables establish important population-level patterns, they must be complemented to understand the specific cognitive mechanisms through which these effects manifest. This cognitive lens enables researchers to identify not only who might be at risk but precisely how and why certain individuals experience adverse outcomes, creating pathways for intervention and prevention. Previous research has demonstrated the malleability of cognitive processes through therapeutic intervention <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Bickel et al., 2011)</ref> or non-invasive brain stimulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Figner et al., 2010</ref>) to manipulate discounting rates, illustrating how the study of cognitive processes may generate actionable insights and can be used to advance targeted intervention <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Koffarnus et al., 2013)</ref>.</p><p>The cognitive approach will also become increasingly relevant as social media platforms are engineered to align with and exploit users' cognitive processes, such as attention allocation or reward sensitivity, to maximise user engagement metrics and corporate revenue <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Strümke et al., 2023)</ref>. Understanding the relationship between cognition, technologies and well-being in this context will be especially critical for safeguarding adolescents, who face unique susceptibilities due to converging neurodevelopmental factors. The rapid design of evidence-based strategies to improve digital well-being might well rest on a cognitive understanding of how -and for whom -specific aspects of social media facilitate negative outcomes.</p></div>

The hypotheses, analyses, and exclusion criteria were preregistered on the Open Science Framework (osf.io/jat54), and the corresponding code is available on GitHub (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17347224). We discuss deviations from the preregistration in the relevant sections and provide a detailed discussion of any deviations in the preregistration deviation table available in Supplement 9.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures</head><p>The subset of task and questionnaire measures available for the present research is outlined in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>, and the procedure in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. Both are described in detail in the sections below. We set out to analyse participants' trial-level data from the temporal delay discounting task and the stop signal reaction time task, however we report analyses and results for the delay discounting task data only. This deviation from the pre-registration followed concerns surrounding the data quality of the stop signal reaction time trial level data, which was inconsistent and featured errors in coding and data values in the sixth measurement wave. Since it was not possible to recover the source of errors, we had to exclude the sixth wave of the stop signal reaction time task and subsequently exclude the task altogether, given that the planned longitudinal analyses were not possible with two measurements spaced two years apart.</p></div>

The task involved a series of choices between small (€0-10), immediately available monetary rewards or a larger (€10) reward available after a variable delay (i.e. 2, 30, 180, or 365 days). Trials of different delays were presented in random order and took the form of "What would you rather have: €2 right away or €10 in 30 days?".</p><p>Rewards were adjusted based on a staircasing procedure aimed at maximising information gained on a given trial, the exact implementation of which is available at https://zenodo.org/records/17338997 and adapted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Du et al.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Self-report questionnaires</head><p>All participants completed a questionnaire battery at each annual measurement wave. The questionnaire batteries varied across the measurement occasions and contained questionnaires pertaining to a range of constructs such as social, emotional, and physical well-being. The self-report measures relevant to the present project include the Behavioural Inhibition and Activation System scale (BIS/BAS; <ref type="bibr">Carver &amp; White, 1994)</ref>, the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ; <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Goodman, 1997</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Goodman, , 2001))</ref>, the Highly Sensitive Child Scale (HSC; <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Pluess et al., 2018)</ref>, and the effortful control subscale of the Early Adolescent Temperament questionnaire (EATQ-EC; <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Capaldi &amp; Rothbart, 1992)</ref>.</p><p>Social media use was assessed using items adapted from the Media Multitasking Index <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Pea et al., 2012)</ref>, assessing time spent engaging in social mediarelated activities, rated on a six-point Likert Scale (never, less than one hour, one to two hours, two to three hours, three to four hours, more than four hours). Social media use was quantified based on participants' responses to the question "On an average weekday, how much time do you spend on your phone or iPad/ tablet viewing public messages, photos, or videos (e.g. Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Snapchat, Twitter)". Moreover, the Compulsive Internet Use Scale (CIUS; <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Meerkerk et al., 2009</ref>) was administered at measurement waves five, six, and seven. This selfreport measure is often used to assess problematic patterns of internet use <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Guertler et al., 2014)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Exclusion criteria</head><p>All exclusion criteria were preregistered on the Open Science Framework at https://osf.io/jat54. Exclusion criteria were split into participant-and trial-level criteria.</p><p>Participants were removed if they showed no variation in their response pattern on the delay discounting task (i.e. accepting or rejecting all offers), or had fewer than twenty trials of data available. These criteria led to the exclusion of no participants across all waves.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data analysis</head><p>Our primary analyses examined the moderating effect of the cognitive process (i.e.</p><p>delay discounting) on the bidirectional, longitudinal relationships between time spent on social media and mental health outcomes. We fit random intercept cross-lagged panel models for each mental health outcome (five models). Delay discounting was quantified based on the trial-level behavioural choices on the monetary delay discounting task. The mental health outcomes included the BAS, the BIS, the HSCS, the SDQ, and the EATQ-EC. Whereas we preregistered analyses for the BIS/BAS total score, this mistake was corrected prior to the analyses, and we performed analyses separately for the BIS and BAS. This decision was based on the fact that the behavioural inhibition and activation systems are considered independent systems, the combination of which would have compromised the validity of our interpretations <ref type="bibr">(Jorm et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr">Maack &amp; Ebesutani, 2018)</ref>.

All models were fit using Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), with 2000 warm-up iterations and 10,000 sampling iterations, across four chains. Model convergence was established by visual inspection of trace plots, and numeric diagnostics, effective sample size (ESS) and R-hats. The R-hat statistic is a quantitative measure of model convergence and is based on the variance estimates within and between MCMC chains, with values greater than 1.1 indicating that the chains have not converged. We further validated our modelling procedure by examining behavioural correlates of computational processes, parameter recovery, and posterior predictive checks. We negative log-transformed the delay discounting parameter <ref type="bibr">(-logk;</ref><ref type="bibr">Weinsztok et al., 2021)</ref>. This means that lower values of -logk are interpreted as steeper discounting of rewards, and vice versa.

The strength of the connections is not based on data and is solely illustrative of how different factors may differentially relate to factors on other levels. For instance, the meso-level process delay discounting is implemented across numerous micro-level brain regions and relates differentially to macro-level factors such as age and gender.</figDesc><graphic coords="5,72.01,116.94,478.79,359.09" type="bitmap" /></figure>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cross-sectional analyses</head><p>To examine the cross-sectional relationships of social media use and compulsive internet use with age and delay discounting, we fit linear mixed effects models with fixed effects for the predictor and random intercepts for participants. We fit the models using the lme4 R package <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Bates et al., 2015)</ref> and examined the marginal and conditional explained variance using the MuMIn R package <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bartoń, 2025)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Random intercept cross-lagged panel models</head><p>We fit separate random intercept cross-lagged panel models (RI-CLPMs) for each mental health outcome (n = 5) and cognitive parameter 'delay discounting' (-logk) to estimate the bi-directional relationship between social media use and well-being and the moderating effect of 'delay discounting' on this relationship. All models were fit using a Bayesian estimator in Mplus, which treats missing data as additional unknown quantities that are sampled from their conditional posterior distribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(McNeish &amp; Hamaker, 2020)</ref>. We examined model fit using the Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA), the Comparative Fit Index (CFI), and the Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI). Model fit was considered good if RMSEA &lt; 0.06, CFI &gt; 0.95, and TLI &gt; 0.95. Model convergence was assessed using the criterion of potential scale reduction (PSR), indicating whether between-chain variation (relative to the total of between-and within-chain variation) of two or more Markov chains is close to zero <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Asparouhov &amp; Muthen, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Asparouhov &amp; Muthén, 2021)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Supplementary Method 1: Hyperbolic Delay Discounting Model</head><p>We modelled participants' temporal preferences on the delay discounting task using a hyperbolic function. The hyperbolic model is an established framework of examining intertemporal choice behaviour and posits that the subjective value V of a delayed reward decreases non-linearly as a function of time <ref type="bibr">(Rubinstein, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr">Story et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">van der Pol &amp; Cairns, 2002)</ref>. The hyperbolic function formulates how the subjective value (V) of an objective reward (A) changes as a function of increases in reward delay (D).</p><p>The free parameter k determines the rate at which increases in delay result in a decreased subjective reward value. Larger values of k translate to steeper decreases in subjective reward value with increasing delays. On a given trial (t), the subjective reward value for the sooner (VSS) and later (VLL) options were estimated and translated into choice probabilities using softmax (Luce's choice rule).</p><p>The softmax includes an inverse temperature parameter, the second free parameter of the model, and controls an individual's sensitivity to differences in subjective value between the sooner and later option. A higher β indicates more consistent (deterministic) choice patterns, whereas a lower β indicates more stochastic choices on the delay discounting task.</p><p>We took a hierarchical Bayesian approach to model fitting <ref type="bibr">(Ahn et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Piray et al., 2019)</ref>, implemented in CmdStan R <ref type="bibr">(Gabry et al., 2023)</ref>, with code adapted from hBayesDM <ref type="bibr">(Ahn et al., 2017)</ref>. All models were fit using Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), with 2000 warm-up iterations and 10,000 sampling iterations, by four chains. Model convergence was established by visual inspection of trace plots (Supplement Figure <ref type="figure">S1</ref>), and effective sample size (ESS) and R-hats. We validated our modelling procedure by examining behavioural correlates of computational processes, parameter recovery, and posterior predictive checks. We log-transformed the delay discounting parameter (-log(k); <ref type="bibr">Weinsztok et al., 2021)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Supplementary Method 4: Summarised Model Estimates</head><p>We fit separate random intercept cross-lagged panel models for each mental health outcome. The baseline models include the autoregressive (AR) and cross-lagged (CL) paths between social media use and the respective mental health outcome. All models were fit using a Bayesian estimator in Mplus, treating missing data as additional unknown quantities that were sampled from the conditional posterior distribution. The estimates for the baseline model, and the moderation model -which includes moderation terms for the cross-lagged paths between social media use and mental health outcome -are presented below. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Supplementary Method 5: Random Intercept Cross-lagged Panel Models</head><p>We fit five random-intercept cross-lagged panel models, one for each well-being outcome included: BIS subscale, BAS subscale, SDQ, HSCS, EATQ-EC. Below, we display the results of each of the models, including all cross-lagged, autoregressive, and moderation effects. We first present the baseline model for the BAS subscale, as the corresponding moderation model is presented in the main manuscript.   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Supplementary Method 8: Multigroup Confirmatory Factor Analysis</head><p>The mental health questionnaires may assess overlapping symptoms, and dimensionality reduction approaches have been used to deal with this. However, these approaches require measurement invariance across repeated measurement occasions, which we examined using multigroup confirmatory factor analyses for the five included self-report questionnaire measures. The results are summarised in Supplementary Table <ref type="table">S3</ref>. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Supplementary Method 9: Preregistration Deviation</head><p>The subset of task and questionnaire measures available for the present research is outlined in Table <ref type="table">1</ref> and the procedure in Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>. Both are described in detail in the sections below. We set out to analyse participants' trial-level data from the temporal delay discounting task and the stop signal reaction time task. However, we report analyses and results for the delay discounting task data only. This deviation from the pre-registration followed concerns surrounding the data quality of the stop signal reaction time trial level data, which was inconsistent and featured errors in coding and data values in the sixth measurement wave. Since it was not possible to recover the error source, we had to exclude the sixth wave of the stop signal reaction time task and subsequently exclude the task altogether, given that the planned longitudinal analyses were not possible with two measurement waves alone.</p><p>The second deviation was a change to the analysis plan, after accessing the data but prior to performing the statistical tests. This change involved examining the BIS and BAS subscales of the BISBAS questionnaire separately <ref type="bibr">(Jorm et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr">Maack &amp; Ebesutani, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">Quilty &amp; Oakman, 2004)</ref>. This change was made to ensure the interpretability of resulting outcomes, as the subscales are considered orthogonal constructs <ref type="bibr">(Carver &amp; White, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr">Jorm et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr">Maack &amp; Ebesutani, 2018)</ref>, the combination of which would have resulted in theoretically and psychometrically invalid conclusions. Both deviations are described in detail in the The mistake was noticed after gaining access to the data, as data access was granted upon submission of the preregistration. However, the mistake was noticed and corrected prior to inspecting the data or performing any analyses.</p><p>Table <ref type="table">S4</ref>. Preregistration Deviations. We follow established guidelines for transparent reporting of deviations from preregistration, providing a comprehensive discussion of the changes, their rationales, and their implications for the interpretation of the results <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">(Willroth &amp; Atherton, 2024)</ref>. We made two substantive deviations: (1) excluding the stop signal reaction time task due to irresolvable data quality issues in the sixth measurement wave, which prevented meaningful analysis of inhibitory control processes, and ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>)</p><p>analysing the Behavioural Inhibition System (BIS) and Behavioural Activation System (BAS) as separate subscales rather than a combined total score, correcting for a psychometric error in the preregistration. Both deviations were made on theoretical and methodological grounds prior to conducting the analyses, with the aim of ensuring the validity and interpretability of our findings</p></div>			</div>
