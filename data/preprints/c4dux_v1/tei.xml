<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In this paper we test the content validity of 246 academic research value items in two interrelated methodological steps. First, we analyze the in-depth evaluation of two experts to assess formal aspects of our items and their relatedness to the construct. Next, we evaluate the relevance of each item based on feedback gathered from 20 experts. Based on these assessments, we review and refine the original item pool and propose a total of 97 value items spread through 10 dimensions.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Values are desirable goals that serve as guiding principles and transcend specific situations <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Schwartz, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Schwartz et al., 2012)</ref>. They are psychological constructs considered central to understanding human behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(English et al., 2018)</ref> and increasingly cited as necessary instruments for social and ethical judgements in science <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Douglas, 2023)</ref> as well as precursors for equitable and sustainable operationalization of (open) scientific standards <ref type="bibr">(UNESCO, 2021)</ref>. Values play a prominent role in terms of their importance for sustainable scientific development and the coordination of scientific research, as well as in improving our understanding of some of the mechanisms that lead to exemplary and questionable science. Yet, there is a lack of valid and reliable tools to measure values in academic research environments <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Kis et al., 2023)</ref>.</p><p>This represents an important gap in light of the credibility crisis facing the social sciences: recognizing and assessing the role of values might provide important insights for understanding and promoting integrity, transparency, and accountability in scientific research <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(English et al., 2018)</ref>. This lack of measurement tools may reflect -at least in part -the shortage of well-accepted and formalized value theories. In turn, it might also signal the challenges of ensuring adequate content coverage of this multifaceted construct's indicators.</p><p>Therefore, the aim of this study -as part of a broader construct validation process -is to examine the content validity of a set of academic value indicators (items). These items are intended as a basis of a theory-driven and psychometrically robust instrument for evaluating values in academic research settings.</p><p>In a previous study, we conducted a review of the personal, work, and scientific values literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Kis et al., 2023)</ref>. Based on this review we defined values in academic research settings as "principles which serve as a basis of evaluating outcomes of scientific work-related actions, guide the selection of scientific work goals, and represent the relative importance assigned to various academic job aspects related to research activities" <ref type="bibr">(Kis et al., 2023, p. 23)</ref>. We defined academic research values by integrating the values literature with our own findings from interviews and surveys with researchers. Then, we operationalized them by developing an initial pool of 246 academic research value items, spread across 36 sub-themes in 11 dimensions: Ambition, Authority, Autonomy, Benevolence, Conformity, Enjoyment, Organizational support, Tradition, Universalism, Variety, and Working environment. For an overview of definitions and example items, see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. An extended explanation of the whole procedure is provided by <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Kis et al. (2023)</ref>. Documenting the development steps rigorously is required to ensure the creation of a solid basis for a scale measuring academic research values, especially given the shortage of existing measurement tools and the benefits of studying values in science. Values are widely accepted to influence behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Sagiv et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Sagiv &amp; Roccas, 2021)</ref>, making them useful tools to improve our knowledge of how values affect research practices. For example, we might be able to find differences between the researchers who commit to responsible conduct of research and those who engage in questionable practices. A validated academic research value measure can help evaluate the effectiveness of responsible research conduct courses and explore personal differences among researchers from various nationalities, disciplines, and career stages <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(English et al., 2018)</ref>. In addition, understanding values unique to research environments can increase the appeal of academic careers to a diverse group of scholars. In the current study, we focus on testing the content validity of the generated items in two interrelated steps. First, two experts provide an in-depth evaluation of the items' formal aspects (grammatical and syntax validity) and the extent to which each relates to the construct for which it was designed (face validity). Based on the results of this first step, we assess their content validity by evaluating the relevance of each item on the basis of the dimension for which it was designed by a second, larger group of experts (N = 20). In addition to assessing each item's readability, clarity, and relevance, this validation phase allows us to review and refine the initial pool of items before moving forward to further exploratory analyses. This article reports on the results of this process with the aim of rigorously and transparently disclosing content validity assessments and facilitating a discussion about proposed value items prior to proceeding with large sample scale development steps.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p>We continue the psychometric measurement development started by <ref type="bibr">Kis and colleagues (2023)</ref>. Publishing these studies as a standalone paper -despite being substeps of a psychometric development process -has two main benefits. First, by publishing these studies independently, we highlight how much effort needs to be invested in each substep of the psychometric research process. Scale development relies on complex and systematic procedures that require a rigorous approach to all stages of the process <ref type="bibr">(Boateng et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Morgado et al., 2017)</ref>. The same rigor in documenting associated methodological choices and steps is essential for maintaining scientific integrity, as well as ensuring transparency and thus enabling other researchers to scrutinize, replicate, or build upon our results. Second, well-documented theoretical analysis of content validity assessments within psychometric work are often missing. Some studies fail to report whether and how they analyzed the opinions of experts and their target population, leaving readers uncertain as to whether only the report or the step itself is missing <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Morgado et al., 2017)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Construct validation and content validity</head><p>The concept of validity has undergone several conceptualizations and definitions over time <ref type="bibr">(American Educational Research Association et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Anastasi, 1950;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Haynes et al., 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Messick, 1989)</ref>. The current view is largely based on <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Messick's (1995)</ref> framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Brown, 2010)</ref>. Messick proposed a comprehensive concept of validity where various aspects -content validity, criterion-related validity, construct validity, and consequential validity -are unified. They defined it as a general judgment about how well evidence and theories support the interpretation and actions based on test scores or other assessment methods <ref type="bibr">(Messick, 1995, p. 741)</ref>.</p><p>Content validity -the adequacy with which a measure evaluates the area of interesthas been pointed out as a prerequisite for testing other aspects of construct validity <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Koller et al., 2017)</ref>. Although existing guidelines highlight the importance of content validity within the construct validation process (American Educational Research <ref type="bibr">Association et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Flake et al., 2017)</ref>, it is often overlooked in practice, and there is a widespread tendency to assume that content validity is limited by the theoretical definition of the construct <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Koller et al., 2017)</ref>, leading to potential subsequent problems. For example, the items may encompass only parts of the construct or may not reflect the intended construct. If content validity is not accomplished, there is no point in testing other aspects of validity. The process of content validity involves several components, such as the formal aspect of the items (e.g. clarity and linguistic aspects of the items), the validity and representativeness of the construct definition, and the appropriateness of the response format <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Koller et al., 2017)</ref>. It includes both qualitative and quantitative approaches and is mainly assessed through the judgment of experts and members of the target population <ref type="bibr">(Boateng et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>The specific aims of the pre-validation phase presented in this paper are: a) to ensure the formal adequacy and face validity of each item (Step 1), assessing whether the items are clear, understandable, grammatically correct and appear to measure what they are intended to measure; b) to identify the most relevant related construct items (Step 2), integrating a quantitative assessment based on the Content Validity Index <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Lawshe, 1975;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Polit &amp; Beck, 2006)</ref> with expert insight.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Content validity assessment: Expert and target population involvement</head><p>In line with recommendations and best practices (American Educational Research <ref type="bibr">Association et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Boateng et al., 2018)</ref>, we based our content validity assessments of the 246 value items derived from our previous study <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Kis et al., 2023)</ref> using both quantitative and qualitative methods across two interrelated steps involving two panels of experts (Step 1: N = 2;</p><p>Step 2: N = 20). We selected experts who are also members of our target population of researchers. A step-by-step overview of all methods used during the process and main results is presented in Table <ref type="table">2</ref>.</p><p>Step</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">-Formal aspects and face validity: mixed methods evaluation by experts</head><p>To assess formal appropriateness (grammatical, syntax, and comprehensibility) as well as face validity of each initial value item, we invited two experts from our direct academic environment in August 2023. In line with <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Haynes et al., 1995)</ref>, in our study we will refer to face validity as "a component of content validity" namely the "degree that respondents or users judge that the items of an assessment instrument are appropriate to the targeted construct and assessment objectives <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Allen &amp; Yen, 1979;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Anastasi, 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Nevo, 1985)</ref>" (p. 243). This preliminary step follows a previous evaluation within the research group (as explained in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Kis et al., 2023)</ref> and is followed by the evaluation of a larger number of experts (Step 2 of the current manuscript). Given the goal of our inquiry, the information richness of the input of our experts, and the analytical steps, we agreed that the sample size does not have to be large.</p><p>Eligibility was based on language skills (i.e., native English speakers), disciplinary expertise with meta-scientific inquiries (e.g., philosophers of science or linguistic experts), as well as independence from this line of research and availability. Eligible experts were invited by members of our research team and asked to self-administer an online survey containing a description of their task, all 246 initial value items and definitions of connected sub-themes and dimensions (see the project's OSF repository). No compensation was offered to these experts.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Survey administration and sample size: gathering enough data from the right people -Future research</head><p>For each item, we asked the experts to provide four types of feedback. In terms of formal appropriateness, experts were asked to evaluate the extent to which the item is comprehensive and clear on a 3-point Likert scale (from 1 = low, to 3 = high) and to provide their suggestions for improving items (e.g., for reformulation, noting redundancies, noting issues / difficulties with dimension definitions). Experts also reported the presence of redundant items (i.e., items representing the same concept). To assess face validity, experts judged if the displayed items are linked (yes or no), to the dimensions they are presented in.</p><p>In addition, experts opted to also share general feedback about the questionnaire.</p><p>Step To represent a wide range of academic perspectives and to align with our prior value studies, we aimed to include researchers across all disciplines regardless of age or nationality while including an equal number of career stages, aiming to keep gender equality. There is still no agreement in the literature on the number of experts required for content validation (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Roebianto et al., 2023</ref> for an overview) and the proposed number of experts varies from a minimum of three <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Lynn, 1986</ref>) even up to twenty <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Gable &amp; Wolf, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Rubio et al., 2003)</ref>. Some authors recommended caution in rigidly adhering to specific numerical thresholds, advocating instead for flexibility that takes into account the complexity of the construct being measured and the expertise required <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Almanasreh et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Grant &amp; Davis, 1997)</ref>. At least five people are recommended to have sufficient control over chance agreement <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Zamanzadeh et al., 2015)</ref>. To sum up, while there is no consensus on the specific number of experts required for content validation, the literature points out that a balanced approach that integrates quantitative guidelines with qualitative considerations is crucial to ensure the validity of assessment instruments.</p><p>For our self-report survey, we require the experts to encompass the diverse perspectives and expertise within the academic community. Specifically, the variables we have considered are academic position (PhD or postdoc vs. assistant, associate, or full professors) and scientific discipline (STEM vs. non-STEM). We therefore decided to recruit a total of 20 experts: 5 PhDs or postdocs in STEM disciplines, 5 PhDs or postdocs in non-STEM disciplines, 5 professors in STEM disciplines and 5 professors in non-STEM disciplines.</p><p>Eligible experts working in the Netherlands were invited via their organizational email addresses, or social media channels and mailing lists operated by the organizations.</p><p>They were invited to participate in a self-administered online survey containing a description of their task, all value items remaining after Step 1, and definitions of connected dimensions (see OSF). A compensation of 50€ (PhD candidates and postdocs) or 100€ (professors) was offered to experts for their time in their chosen format (donation / gift card / bank transfer).</p><p>Consistent with extant practice <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Polit &amp; Beck, 2006)</ref>, we asked the experts to evaluate the relevance of each value item to the category it was displayed in, using a 4-point Likert scale (1 -the item is not relevant to the category it is displayed in; 2 -the item is somewhat relevant to the category it is displayed in; 3 -the item is quite relevant to the category it is displayed in; 4 -the item is highly relevant to the category it is displayed in). They were instructed to be objective and constructive, to rate each item using the entire scale, be sensitive to differences between the four options, and to evaluate the construct as one about researchers in general rather than themselves -values that might be of importance to at least some researchers even if they might not be as vital to others or the experts themselves.</p><p>Based on the literature (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Lynn, 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Shrotryia &amp; Dhanda, 2019)</ref>, responses to each item were dichotomized as 0 (not relevant) for "somewhat relevant" or "not relevant"</p><p>responses and 1 (relevant) for "relevant" or "quite relevant" responses. To assess the validity of each item, the content validity index was calculated as the proportion of 1 (relevant) to the total number of ratings (i.e., 20 = number of experts). Quantitative procedures for evaluating content validity, including the use of cutoff values, have been proposed to encourage a more systematic approach to the content validation process. These procedures offer valuable guidelines for assessing the degree of agreement among experts regarding the relevance and representativeness of assessment content. However, these cutoff values are subject to adjustments across studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Hardesty &amp; Bearden, 2004)</ref> and should be interpreted based on the nature of the construct, target population, and intended assessment use <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Messick, 1995)</ref>. It is also recommended to use quantitative procedure in association with qualitative insights from experts <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Delgado-Rico et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Spoto et al., 2023</ref>) that may provide judgments on contextual factors (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Haynes et al., 1995)</ref> that may not be captured by quantitative measures alone.</p><p>Although the CVI is extensively used to estimate content validity, this index does not consider the possibility of inflated values because of the chance agreement. To address this shortcoming, we also considered the multi-rater kappa index (Kappa) because, unlike the CVI, it suitably adjusts for this potential biased chance agreement. Based on the extant literature, values <ref type="bibr">below .40; between .41 and .60; between .61 and .80; and above .80</ref> were considered to indicate fair, moderate, good, and excellent agreement respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Polit &amp; Beck, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Viera &amp; Garrett, 2005)</ref>.</p><p>Accordingly, during initial evaluation, items with a Kappa index lower than .60 were categorized as "not appropriate". All other items (i.e., items with a Kappa index greater than or equal to .60) were rated based on their CVI, labeling items either "appropriate" (CV I ≥</p><p>.78), "to be revised" (.70 ≤ CV I ≤ .77), or "not appropriate" (CV I ≤ .70). These labels were based on the existing literature recommending the cut-offs to be set according to the number of experts -with cut-off limits decreasing as the number of experts increases. In the literature, when there are more than 9 experts, researchers tend to use .78 as the cut-off value.</p><p>However, it is plausible that in our case of 20 experts, the cut-off should be lowered further and .70 might be considered a reasonable cut-off value.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Step 1 -Formal aspects and face validity: mixed methods evaluation by experts</p><p>In Step 1, items were pre-validated by two philosophers of science. Results were assessed using a mixed-methods approach as described in Table <ref type="table">3</ref>. From the complete pool of 246 items, a number of 122 items reported problems connected to clarity (the extent to which the item is comprehendible), link to dimensions (whether the item is linked to the corresponding dimension), and other aspects. These other aspects were categorized based on experts' suggestions as issues of ambiguity, broadness or vagueness, relevance, phrasing, miscategorization, connection between question formulation and item, and peculiarity. Items with problems were then grouped based on ease of correction (easy, moderate, hard) to facilitate decisions about inclusion. After rephrasing items with phrasing difficulties and excluding the most problematic items, the 240 item list was further reduced to 212 items based on experts' suggestions about overlaps and redundancies. In cases of redundancy, the more formally appropriate item would be chosen. After discussing cases labeled hard to correct and a final round of overlap-related exclusions, this step resulted in a list of 205 value items, as depicted in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. All data and analysis files as well as a more extensive description of methods and results are available in the project's OSF repository.</p></div>

Because 21 experts (5 PhD candidates in STEM and 5 in non-STEM disciplines, 6 professors in STEM and 5 professors in non-STEM disciplines) finished filling out the survey due to the invitation methods, we excluded 1 professor randomly from the STEM group prior to analysis to equalize the number of participants per group. This was done to ensure that each group had the same weight in determining the multi-rater kappa index and content validity index.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Content validity index calculation</head><p>No missing data was present. One item was also excluded based on redundancy (i.e., almost completely overlapping phrasing) after analysis, keeping the item with the higher validity. Namely, in the Benevolence dimension, "To feel like I am a part of the research community" was included and "To feel that I am a part of the research community" was excluded.</p><p>To assess whether the probability of evaluating an item as valid was associated with academic status (PhD/postdoc vs. professor), discipline (non-STEM vs STEM), or a factor of an interaction between academic status and discipline, a logistic mixed-effects regression was conducted. Random effects included random intercepts for Subjects (N = 20) and Items (N = 204). From the analysis of model deviance, no effect was found to be statistically significant at the 5% level: academic status (𝜒𝜒 2 (1) = 1.430 ; p = .232), discipline (𝜒𝜒 2 (1) = 1.560 ; p = .212), interaction (𝜒𝜒 2 (1) = .937 ; p = .333). Although there was no statistically significant effect of academic status and discipline, the small sample size does not allow us to detect small differences, and descriptively, there might be a slightly lower score from non-STEM professors (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> for descriptive results).    <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">5</ref>).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>In this study, we use a mixed-method approach to validate a scale measuring values in academic research settings. Building on prior conceptualization and item generation work, we reduced a set of 246 academic research value items to 97, spread over 10 dimensions (Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> and Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">7</ref>) based on expert input through two steps. First, aided by the grammatical, syntax, and face validity evaluation of two experts, we reduced the list to 205 items. Second, the relevance of each item was calculated through the content validity assessments of 20 experts. To our knowledge, our attempts are the first that aim to create and validate a scale measuring academic research values by integrating insights from most broadly used personal and work value measurements. In this paper, we provide detailed documentation to enhance the transparency of our methodology. This mitigates the need for future researchers to start from scratch and allows them to use our results as a springboard for further investigation. By making our findings accessible, we contribute to a growing body of knowledge that can evolve through incremental advancements rather than parallel efforts.</p><p>In some regards our results align with prior understandings of the values and motivations of researchers. Some of the best rated dimensions (based on their S-CVI) such as autonomy, benevolence, universalism, or variety overlap with the value items participants ranked as high importance in our prior study <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Kis et al., 2023)</ref> as well as in other, comparable value questionnaires <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Knafo &amp; Sagiv, 2004)</ref>. Items included in these dimensions referring to self determination, professional autonomy, freedom of choice, or being curious, creative, honest, and supportive are recognizable and relatable descriptors of the stereotypical or ideal researcher &amp; Dieckmann, 2020; <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Tintori, 2017)</ref> and are often presented as virtues and bases of good scientific practices <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Demirutku &amp; Güngör, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">English et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Knafo &amp; Sagiv, 2004)</ref>.</p><p>The sub-themes that remained unchanged due to their items' satisfactory CVI ratings (Dependability, Enjoying research, Fairness -see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">5</ref>) posit a similar interpretation. For the Dependability sub-theme, this could be partly due to it consisting of only one item. Still, some benevolence values have been reported to hold increased importance for researchers <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Knafo &amp; Sagiv, 2004)</ref> and being dependable and trustworthy may be considered especially relevant in a vocation geared as much towards generating dependable results as academia is.</p><p>In a similar fashion, Enjoying research and solving puzzles seems to be intrinsic to being a researcher, as marked by reports on the motivations of scientists <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Guerin et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Lam, 2011)</ref>. Values pertaining to Fairness and Organizational support have yet to be tested in terms of their importance to researchers. However, the growing body of literature on academics' experiences within precarious or toxic organizational environments (recent examples include: <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Kis et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">McKenzie, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Pelletier et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Pruit et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Skakni et al., 2019)</ref> signals that safe, secure, and fair organizational settings are valued by researchers.</p><p>The values that are less associated with scientific work allow for an equally interesting discussion relevant for current debates about academic work. During the validation process we excluded two value sub-themes from the final scale (i.e., Salary and Modesty) based on the low content validity indices of these sub-themes. This outcome aligns with some of our prior discussions on researchers' values <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Kis et al., 2023)</ref>: values represented in the Salary sub-theme such as earning a high salary or increasing one's income are aligned with the theoretical underpinnings of the values literature and as such, have also been included in another scientific value scale. However, our prior results as well as that of others have consistently ranked personal income in the bottom of researchers' motivational hierarchies.</p><p>Similarly, values related to tradition were ranked low in previous studies.</p><p>The exclusion of some values underscores the need for critical evaluations of the relevance and impact of each of these sub-themes. Excluding these values also emphasizes the need to focus on those dimensions that garner broad-based support across the academic community. The absence of specific sub-themes, however, does not diminish their potential significance for academic values. The low ratings may instead suggest variability in expert opinions, as well as self-selection bias. This may be especially relevant for the Salary subtheme. Although our invitation message noted our financial incentive, it was set up to convey our need for help and advice regarding a topic important to the scientific community (see invitation protocol in our OSF repository). Participants who chose to participate might have cared comparatively less about high salaries than some of those who did not participate. This limitation marks the need for future research to refine our validation procedures.</p><p>Approaches better suited to capture these aspects might yield benefits in terms of better understanding these now unused sub-themes which might hold substantial importance in academic settings. The tension between a normative versus descriptive approach to values in academic research illustrates one of our study's limitations. While invaluable, the input from our experts may carry inherent biases towards normative values, potentially skewing the scale towards idealized perceptions rather than describing empirical realities. Acknowledging these biases is crucial as it informs the interpretation of our results and guides future research to address these gaps.</p><p>Another limitation of our methods stems from some of our decisions. We made efforts to minimize inconsistencies and incorporate empirical evidence based on best practices, butpartly due to a lack of straightforward guidelines and the complexity of our construct -our process necessarily incorporated some subjective choices. For example, qualitative stages involving coding and excluding items in both Step 1 and 2 could have yielded different outcomes for different researchers. Arguably, many (if not most) of these subjective choices were unavoidable due to the nature of our approach. We also tried to provide detailed documentation of each of our steps to ensure full transparency.</p><p>Moreover, the sample selection, although adequate for initial explorations and set up to encounter uncontrollable variety in responses, limited our scope to collecting the opinions of researchers working in the Netherlands. This sample is unlikely to fully capture the diversity of academic values across different disciplines and cultural contexts. As such, it should be interpreted responsibly in terms of the generalizability of our current findings. The sample size also affected our ability to conduct measurement invariance tests across disciplines and contexts, which are key to valid and generalizable measures <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Hussey &amp; Hughes, 2020)</ref>. The reliance on expert judgments in the validation process might overlook nuances that could be captured through broader community engagement or more varied methodological approaches. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Mason et al. (2023)</ref> illustrate how non-expert perceptions of psychological measures can inform and enrich the validation process via qualitative methods, reinforcing the importance of integrating various populations (and approaches) to fully capture and validate new measures. Testing generalizability and extending our inquiries to more diverse groups will be a goal for future research.</p><p>Several of these limitations may be addressed in subsequent stages of the scale development process, since the scale still needs to be further evaluated before being reliably</p><p>applicable. An important future development step is to involve larger and more diverse samples of researchers to ensure a more representative range of the target population.</p><p>Additionally, methodological steps will include examining the factorial structure of the instrument through exploratory methods (i.e., Exploratory Factor Analysis) followed by confirmatory methods (i.e., Confirmatory Factor Analysis), and evaluating the external validity of the scale (i.e., the relationship of the emerged factors with external measures).</p><p>In conclusion, this research advances the field by developing a new measure of academic values and critically examines the complexities involved in such a task. The implications of our findings extend beyond scale development. Some of our results provide insights into the normative structures that influence academic behaviors and priorities. Others are relevant in terms of detailing the methodological steps and choices involved in content validation of psychological scales.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>2 -Content validity index: quantitative evaluation by expertsAs part of quantitative content validity evaluation, multi-rater kappa index (Kappa) and Content Validity Index (CVI) were assessed based on the responses of a panel of experts working in the Netherlands. The project was registered in the study proposal and ethical form approved by the TU/e's Ethical Review Board (ID: 1914, see OSF) prior to data collection between November and December 2023. For this stage of the process, we conceptualized experts as researchers of all ranks who have a keen interest in and expertise with discussions about the values and future of science and academia. Accordingly, eligibility and invitations were based on membership or active participation in organizations aimed at bettering science and academia as a whole (e.g., the Young Academy of the Netherlands and Promovendi Netwerk Nederland, the national interest group for and by PhD candidates).</figDesc></figure>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Weighing items</head><p>To even out item numbers per dimension for further psychometric evaluation, the list of 122 items was further revised. Sub-themes -originally derived from the value theories underlying our item generation process to represent a broad array of value constructs -within the same dimensions were weighed against each other to calculate how many of their items were to be included (see item weighing exemplified in Table <ref type="table">6</ref>). To build a balanced and parsimonious instrument including an adequate number of items in terms of representativeness and reliability, we aimed to maintain a range of 8-10 items for each dimension (at least 8 each, more for dimensions with enough items to select from) and include only the top-rated items (in terms of CVI) per sub-theme accordingly. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Qualitative assessment</head><p>Items with the same CVI were further qualitatively evaluated for their fit within the dimension by checking for overlaps in meanings with other items and their theoretical relevance. For each dimension we selected the most relevant theoretically related items </p></div>			</div>
