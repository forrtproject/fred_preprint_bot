<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This single-case design meta-analysis examined the effects of self-management strategies (SM) on academic engagement in autistic students. Prior meta-analyses reported positive outcomes but did not account for the nested structure of single-case designs. Using multilevel modeling, we addressed this limitation and examined moderators of implementation practices. Eligible studies were peer-reviewed, published in English, school-based, included at least one autistic participant, used a single-case design with a baseline and intervention phase, employed time intervals for SM, and targeted positive outcomes. We searched ProQuest, EBSCO, and Web of Science through March 10, 2024. Risk of bias was assessed using the SCD RoB tool. 14 studies (29 participants) met inclusion criteria; SM increased academic engagement by 49.87% (SE = 4.33,   95% CI [39.76, 59.59], p &lt; .001). Variability existed across participants and studies, with 9 studies (17 participants) contributing to moderator analyses. Classroom subject, classroom type, technology-based prompting, and the time interval of SM did not significantly explain variability. Limitations include small sample sizes, exclusion of three studies due to missing information, and high risk of bias in assessors' knowledge of study phase. Overall, SM has the potential of being a flexible strategy supporting autistic students' academic engagement.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Self-management (SM) strategies are evidence based techniques that help students achieve desired behaviors by observing, assessing, and modifying their own behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Cooper et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Schulze, 2016)</ref>. SM strategies are an effective practice for many students, including autistic students <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Carr et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Lee et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Scheibel et al., 2024)</ref>. Autism is described as a developmental disability categorized by differences in communication and social interactions, along with repetitive behaviors, restricted interests, and atypical sensory processing <ref type="bibr">(American Psychiatric Association, 2022)</ref>. Severity ranges from Level 1, requiring support, to Level 3, requiring substantial support, and is often accompanied by differences in language use and cooccurring intellectual disabilities. As a result, some autistic students may exhibit behaviors that interfere with learning and academic engagement <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Sparapani et al., 2016)</ref>. Many of the challenges autistic students face that impact academic performance often stems from factors outside of academic ability <ref type="bibr">(Adams et al., 2025)</ref>, such as non-academic skills including selfregulation, sustained attention, and engagement that impact classroom performance <ref type="bibr">(Carnahan et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Morningstar et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Academic engagement, defined as the level of participation and investment in educational activities, is a critical component of academic success <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bangert-Drowns &amp; Pyke, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Lawson &amp; Masyn, 2015)</ref>. However, research has shown that autistic students tend to demonstrate lower engagement and spend less time on task during instruction compared to their typically developing peers and students with other disabilities <ref type="bibr">(Carnahan et al., 2009)</ref>. Given this, identifying strategies that promote engagement and on-task behavior is essential for supporting the academic outcomes of autistic students. SM interventions, which have been used to support engagement and on-task behavior, are particularly well-suited for autistic students because they can be individualized to reflect the unique profiles of students and promote autonomy in the classroom <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Briesch et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Odom et al., 2012)</ref>. Several meta-analyses of single-case design research have reported positive effects of SM intervention on combined outcomes, including academic, social, behavioral, adaptive, and communication skills, in autistic students <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Carr et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Lee et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Scheibel et al., 2024)</ref>. However, the term SM has been applied to a wide variety of intervention approaches that differ in key implementation features, such as classroom setting, grade level, self-reporting format, and frequency of student self-recording <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Briesch et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Scheibel et al., 2024)</ref>.</p><p>While prior reviews have acknowledged this variability and described the proportion of studies using specific implementation characteristics, they have not systematically examined whether and how these features independently are related to academic outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Briesch et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Scheibel et al., 2024)</ref>. This gap is especially true for academic engagement, which is a consistently used outcome in SM research <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Scheibel et al., 2024)</ref>. Instead, conclusions of effectiveness across implementation features have been based on the distribution of different implementation characteristics across studies or the effects of overall configurations of SM elements.</p><p>Moreover, previous synthesis often relied on analytic techniques that do not account for the nested nature of single case design data <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Moeyaert et al., 2018</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Moeyaert et al., , 2023))</ref>. This study aims to build on the existing evidence base by applying a multilevel meta-analytic approach to explore the effectiveness of SM interventions for autistic students' academic engagement, as well as on additional academic outcomes when sample size permits. This approach integrates statistical advances that consider the nested nature of the data and allow for the systematic investigation of moderators <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Moeyaert et al., 2018</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Moeyaert et al., , 2023))</ref>. By empirically investigating implementation characteristics across studies, this review aims to advance the field's understanding of how variations in SM intervention characteristics may relate to academic engagement for autistic students.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic Performance and Engagement in Autistic Students</head><p>Academic achievement among autistic students varies widely <ref type="bibr">(Estes et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Kim et al., 2018)</ref>, with many autistic students performing below the threshold of anticipated academic abilities across a variety of subject areas and domains <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Keen et al., 2023)</ref>. Student engagement, in particular, is widely recognized as a key contributor to learning and academic achievement <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bangert-Drowns &amp; Pyke, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Lawson &amp; Masyn, 2015)</ref>. Although engagement is multidimensional-including affective engagement, behavioral engagement, and cognitive engagement <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Lawson &amp; Lawson, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Lawson &amp; Masyn, 2015)</ref>-in classroom settings, engagement is often operationalized unidimensionally as observable behavior such as looking at the teacher, remaining seated, and proportion of time working on the appropriate task <ref type="bibr">(Carnahan et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Cihak et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Xu et al., 2017)</ref>. Autistic students often exhibit low levels of behavioral engagement during instruction, which can reduce their availability for learning <ref type="bibr">(Carnahan et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Sparapani et al., 2016)</ref>.</p><p>In addition, autistic students may experience additional academic challenges with learning, attention, and processing speed compared to their typically developing peers <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Mayes &amp; Calhoun, 2007)</ref>, and such skills as inhibitory control and attention skills has been found to be associated with task engagement and academic skills in typically developing students (e.g., emergent literacy and language skills; <ref type="bibr">Bohlmann &amp; Downer, 2016)</ref>. As a result, autistic students may be less available for learning by spending less time on task-behavior that demonstrates a student is behaviorally engaged in the appropriate learning activity <ref type="bibr">(Carnahan et al., 2009)</ref>which can adversely impact their academic performance. Therefore, it is not surprising that a majority of studies investigating the effectiveness of SM for academics have focused on the reporting of on-task behavior as an outcome measure (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Briesch et al., 2018</ref> for a review).</p><p>Furthermore, because on-task behavior is a component of behavioral engagement <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Fredricks, 2022)</ref>, and they often have overlap in their defined measurement (e.g., both might contain looking at the teacher; <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Callahan et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Xu et al., 2017)</ref>, a previous review has grouped together author reported outcomes of engagement and on-task behavior as one outcome: engagement <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Scheibel et al., 2024)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Self-Management</head><p>One way to support autistic students in the classroom is through evidence-based practices (EBPs), which are demonstrated through scientifically rigorous research to have positive outcomes. Two independent organizations, the National Professional Development Center on ASD <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Hume et al., 2021)</ref> and the National Autism Center (2015), have developed a list of evidence-based practices and programs for autistic people. Among these practices is SM. The National Clearinghouse on Autism Evidence and Practice describes SM as distinguishing between appropriate and inappropriate behaviors, planning, executing, and monitoring successful behaviors, and rewarding themselves when appropriate <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Steinbrenner et al., 2020)</ref>. Though often equated with self-monitoring, SM is a broader construct that encompasses a range of strategies, including goal setting, self-evaluation and self-reinforcement <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Chia et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Rafferty &amp; Asaro-Saddler, 2021)</ref>. SM strategies can be easily adaptable or individualized, which may be ideal for autistic students <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Scheibel et al., 2024)</ref> given their varying nature (American Psychiatric Association, 2022; <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Kim et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Research has documented substantial variability in how SM interventions are implemented. In a broader systematic review examining characteristics of SM interventions in 56 studies across various populations and outcomes, <ref type="bibr">Briesch, Daniels, and Beneville (2019)</ref> found large variability in how SM interventions are implemented. Some of the common features of reporting included differences in the frequency of self-reporting, as well as variations in implementation settings (e.g., general education vs. special education classrooms) and grade levels. Although they found strong effects for SM interventions overall, the high degree of variation across studies limited the ability to isolate and evaluate the impact of specific features.</p><p>They were able to calculate effect sizes only for intervention configurations that appeared in at least three studies with just one varying feature, for example, the type of diagnosis for elementary students in special education classes using prompt-based SM, the effect of graphing with SM, or the effect of using checklists for SM procedures. This constrained efforts to compare effect sizes of many of the specific implementation features (e.g., setting and frequency of selfreporting). Moreover, SM interventions have also occurred during a variety of class subjects (e.g., math, language arts, science; <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Cihak et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Holifield et al. 2010)</ref> and have used a variety of materials for self-reporting including technology-based applications or paper and pens <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Chia et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Scheibel et al., 2024)</ref>.</p><p>Despite variability in implementation, SM has several practical benefits in classroom settings. SM promotes independence, can be applied in diverse environments, and often supports autistic students with generalizing behavioral changes, which is a common challenge for many autistic individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(McDougall 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Rafferty &amp; Asaro-Saddler, 2021)</ref>. In the classroom setting, SM allows for minimal management by teachers and, in turn, can maximize instructional time <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Cooper et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Southall &amp; Gast, 2011)</ref>. Moreover, general education teachers have reported a preference for using SM in integrated classroom settings as they require minimal facilitation and implementation actions by teachers <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Southall &amp; Gast, 2011)</ref>. This finding is particularly relevant as the number of autistic students placed full-time in general education classrooms has increased (National Center for Education Statistics, 2023).</p><p>Previous meta-analyses of single-case design studies have evaluated the effectiveness of SM for autistic people (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Carr et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Chia et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Scheibel et al., 2024)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Carr and colleagues (2014)</ref> analyzed 23 single-case design studies using the What Works Clearinghouse standards <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Kratochwill et al., 2010)</ref> to identify quality, which includes judgments, for example, on the number of participants and demonstrations of effect in each study. They also used the percentage of non-overlapping data (PND)-what percentage of observations in the treatment phase do not overlap with the baseline phase <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Scruggs et al., 1987)</ref>-to quantify the intervention effect. Results indicate that SM interventions effectively increased academic skills for students of all ages and levels of ability and that generalization and maintenance rates were high, with a mean PND of 84.3% <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Carr et al., 2014)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Chia and colleagues (2018)</ref> also examined 12 singlecase studies using the What Works Clearinghouse standards, focusing specifically on studies using technology to support SM interventions. Using the percentage of non-overlapping data, they found the interventions to be effective, with a mean PND = 78.8% and a median PND = 88.9%. Most recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Scheibel et al. (2024)</ref> conducted a meta-analysis across multiple domains (e.g., social, behavioral, academic) and reported that studies were of varying quality, with just over a quarter of studies (26%) being excluded due to low quality or rigor, as analyzed using the Single Case Analysis and Review Framework 2.0 (SCARF; <ref type="bibr">Ledford et al., 2020)</ref>. Of the reviewed studies, <ref type="bibr">Scheibel and colleagues (2024)</ref> focused on 24 treatment effects on the outcome of engagement across five studies. Using the Log Response Ratio (LRR), or the log of the proportion of the mean of the intervention data and the mean of the baseline data <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Pustejovsky et al., 2018)</ref>, they determined that using SM strategies positively increased engagement behavior (LRR%=166%, <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Scheibel et al., 2024)</ref>.</p><p>Despite promising findings, previous meta-analyses face methodological limitations.</p><p>First, PND and LRR were used to compute effect sizes. Although both methods allow for a combined understanding of effects across single case design studies, they have some limitations. PND, for instance, is at risk for outliers <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Rakap, 2015)</ref> and can fail to detect meaningful effects when there are observable visual changes in performance level, trend, or variability between phases in graphical data displays <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Lenz, 2013)</ref>. The LRR index can be heavily influenced by procedural characteristics of a study's design <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Pustejovsky et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">2019)</ref>. As there is much diversity in single-case design methodologies, nuanced procedural aspects can potentially introduce bias and affect the reliability of results.</p><p>Furthermore, both PND and LRR are case-specific effect sizes and are traditionally aggregated across cases and across studies by using a simple average <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Pustejovsky et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Rakap, 2015)</ref>. Consequently, the nested nature of single case design data is ignored, wherein cases are nested within participants and participants are nested within studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Moeyaert et al., 2018)</ref>. Therefore, case-level (e.g., classroom subject) and study-level (e.g., intervention modality) moderators cannot be investigated. For this reason, a multilevel meta-analysis regression model is recommended and applied in the current study, as this advanced technique allows for estimating effect sizes while considering the nested nature of the data <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Moeyaert, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Moeyaert et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">2023</ref>). An overall average weighted effect size across cases and studies is obtained in addition to an estimate of between-case and between-study variance in intervention effectiveness. Moreover, case and study-level moderators can be added to the model in an attempt to explain intervention heterogeneity by investigating the effect for each case, between cases in a study, and between multiple studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Moeyaert, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Moeyaert et al., 2018)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Current Study</head><p>In this study, we aimed to explore the effects of SM on academic engagement and academic outcomes more broadly for autistic students. Specifically, we used a three-level hierarchical meta-analysis to estimate the effects of SM on academic engagement and investigate variability in intervention effectiveness between studies and participants. This extends previous work by allowing for a more comprehensive understanding of the nested nature of data while facilitating the inclusion of other implementation factors at the case and study level, such as classroom type, academic subject, method of students' SM self-reporting, and time intervals of student self-reporting. We also include additional databases from those used in previous metaanalyses <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Carr et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Scheibel et al., 2024)</ref> to expand our search and include dissertations in our search criteria. Our goal was to produce a more comprehensive understanding of the effect of SM on academic engagement and identify key factors that contribute to the effectiveness of SM.</p><p>Based on previous meta-analyses that have discovered positive academic effects of SM for autistic students (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Carr et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Scheibel et al., 2024)</ref>, we hypothesized that SM will positively affect academic outcomes, particularly academic engagement, for autistic students.</p><p>Additionally, as many studies discuss the ability to adapt and create individualized plans of SM strategies <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Cooper et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Rafferty &amp; Asaro-Saddler, 2021)</ref>, we expected that the moderators of classroom type (i.e., self-contained or general education) and subject (i.e., science and math or other) will account for little variance in the effect of the SM intervention.</p><p>Additionally, we anticipated that autistic students would broadly vary in their initial performance (i.e., mean baseline) before the SM implementation and intervention effectiveness of academic engagement (i.e., treatment effect; e.g., <ref type="bibr">Chen et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Kim et al., 2018)</ref>. As previous metaanalyses have not investigated the frequency of student self-monitoring and the use of applications vs non-applications for self-monitoring, these two moderators are exploratory.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Literature Search</head><p>A systematic review was conducted to identify eligible studies investigating the impact of SM on autistic students' academic engagement and academic outcomes more broadly. To expand the previous meta-analysis, we consulted the databases APA PsycInfo, Education Resources Information Center (ERIC), and ProQuest Dissertation and Theses Global within ProQuest, as these databases were previously used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Carr et al. (2014)</ref>  OR math OR science OR social studies OR history OR on-task*. Additional search criteria included peer-reviewed articles in English published before March 10 th , 2024. Boolean search strings were applied to title and abstracts. Three hundred thirty-six articles were retrieved across the databases (see Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). For reliability purposes, an independent search using the same procedure was performed by the fourth author, which yielded identical results. An ancestorial search also occurred from meta-analyses previously published in the past ten years <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Carr et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Chia et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Scheibel et al., 2024)</ref>. Four additional articles were identified for screening.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 1 Flow Process of Eligible Studies</head><p>The software program Rayyan assisted with deduplication and tracking the screening process <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Ouzzani et al., 2016)</ref>. Using the deduplication tool, the first author reviewed the 201 articles flagged as possible duplicates. When a dissertation was published as an article, the version with more information was maintained. After careful consideration and removal of identical articles, a total of 139 unique articles were retained.</p><p>To be considered for inclusion in this meta-analysis, each article initially underwent an abstract and title screening, isolating articles that met the following five criteria. First, for a study to be eligible, an autism diagnosis or priorly used terminology for autism, such as Asperger's and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS; <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Oberman &amp; Kaufmann, 2020)</ref>, needed to be present for at least one participant, and only those participants were included in the analysis. Second, the study needed to take place in a school-based setting, such as a preschool, elementary school, middle school, high school, or post-secondary setting. Third, studies needed to employ single-case designs that included both a baseline and intervention phase, such as multiple baseline designs (MBD) and reversal designs (ABAB).

There was much overlap in how studies conceptualized engagement versus on-task. For instance, <ref type="bibr">Cihak et al. (2010, p. 139</ref>) defined task engagement as "(a) being in one's seat, (b) looking at the materials or teacher as requested, (c) writing letters or words related to the assigned task, and d) complying with instructions with 4 s," while <ref type="bibr">Stasolla et al.

Considering that studies conceptualizations of engagement and on-task behavior similarly intersect and are all encompassed within the behavioral component of academic engagement <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Fredricks, 2022)</ref>, we aggregated studies that used either outcome into a single category of academic engagement for analysis.</p><p>Other academic outcomes identified within the screening procedures included accuracy <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Beckman et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Holifield et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Romans et al., 2020)</ref> and activity completion <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Rosenbloom, 2017)</ref>.

When modeling the changes of level between the baseline and intervention phase (Model 1), the overall baseline level (𝛾 000 ) for academic behavior is 37.11% <ref type="bibr">(SE = 4.26,</ref><ref type="bibr">95% CI [28.16,</ref><ref type="bibr">45</ref>.65], p &lt; .001).

Although the SM intervention, in general, is large and statistically significant, there is a good deal of between-case and betweenstudy variance in both baseline performance (𝜎 ̂𝑢0 2 = 18.20, 95% <ref type="bibr">CI [14.13,</ref><ref type="bibr">22.41]</ref>; 𝜎 ̂𝑣0 2 = 9.55, 95% CI [3.50, 14.17]) and intervention effectiveness (𝜎 ̂𝑢1 2 = 9.52, 95% <ref type="bibr">CI [6.20,</ref><ref type="bibr">13.49</ref>]; 𝜎 ̂𝑣1 2 = 16.57, 95% <ref type="bibr">CI [11.81,</ref><ref type="bibr">12.91]</ref>). This indicates that individual participants and studies differed in their baseline levels of academic behavior and that there was large variability in the treatment effect at the individual participant and study levels. Given the heterogeneity in the baseline level and treatment effect at the study and case levels, moderators are included in the analysis (Model 2). The four moderators: (1) academic subject during SM intervention (language arts/social studies/communication or Math/Science),</p><p>(2) classroom type (special or general education), (3) modality of self-monitoring (i.e., application or other method), and (4) average time interval of students self-monitoring academic behavior in seconds, were considered. Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> and<ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> display the included moderators' case or study-level descriptives. Although communication is not inherently an academic subject, it was included for one study because the student was participating in an SM intervention during a college-level academic course on communication <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Siko, 2018)</ref>.</p><p>The time interval in seconds of student self-monitoring was mean-centered, ranging between -89.21 and 255.93 (range = 345.13). The skewness and kurtosis equal 0.41 and 1.35, respectively, indicating no evidence for deviations from normality. A histogram plot displayed two outlying studies <ref type="bibr">(Finn et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Legge et al., 2010)</ref>. The mean centered frequency for the two participants from <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Holifield et al.

Therefore, the data from these cases are not considered for meta-regression as they deviate significantly from the overall distribution.</p><p>Additionally, three studies were excluded from the analysis due to missing values for the moderator's implementation subject and class types <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Huffman et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Stasolla et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Xu et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p>A total of 9 studies with 17 study participants remained for the Model 2 meta-regression.</p><p>A reference group was created. The reference group consisted of participants who were in a general education classroom, participated in the intervention during a non-STEM subject, used an application-based SM reporting, and reported their academic behavior at the meantime interval for student self-reporting. For this reference group, the estimated baseline level is 37.42% (SE = 16.31, t = 2.433, p = .015). The intervention effect for the reference group is 55.38% (SE = 10.94, t = 5.062, p &lt; .001). The intervention effect is 9.7% higher for students who took part in the SM intervention in a special education classroom compared to a general education classroom, 0.99% lower for students who participated in SM during STEM vs. not, and 12.18% lower for participants who used a non-application-based reporting method (e.g., paper checklist). Lastly, for every unit increase in the self-reporting time interval, the intervention effect increased by 0.06%. None of the moderators are statistically significant. With limited studies and participants, Model 2 analysis had low statistical power. Therefore, consideration of the practical significance was necessary. Of the four moderators across the implementation of SM, the moderator effects are relatively small and do not explain much variability, meaning that these implementation factors do not hold much weight in the effectiveness of SM for autistic students' academic behavior.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>A multilevel meta-analysis was performed to investigate the effectiveness of SM on the academic engagement of autistic students. Based on previous findings, we expected that SM would positively impact students' academic engagement <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Carr et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Chia et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Scheibel et al., 2024)</ref>. Overall, results supported this hypothesis, indicating that SM has a strong positive effect on academic behavior (i.e., on-task and engagement) for autistic students.</p><p>Corroborating findings in other reviews, we also found that on-task behaviors were the most commonly used outcome measures for SM <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Briesch et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Scheibel et al., 2024)</ref>. As on-task behavior is a component of engagement <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Fredricks, 2022)</ref> and studies operationalized on-task behaviors and academic engagement in the same way, we therefore combined the two studies in which authors reported measuring academic engagement <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Cihak et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Xu et al. 2017)</ref> with the remaining twelve studies that were reported as measuring on-task behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Beckman et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Callahan et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr">Clemons et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Finn et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Holifield et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Huffman et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Legge et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Romans et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Rosenbloom et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Rosenbloom et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Siko, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Stasolla et al., 2014)</ref>. On task behavior and engagement across these studies has included (but is not limited to) sitting in a seat, making eye contact, writing on a worksheet, reading assignment, looking at work, counting manipulatives, and listening to their teacher. Specific behaviors measured for engagement and on-task behavior for each study are reported on OSF.</p><p>Autistic students displayed varying academic behavior initially amongst participants and between studies, further corroborating the heterogeneity of academic profiles of autistic students (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Chen et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Kim et al., 2018)</ref>. Considerable variability of the intervention effect on academic behavior was also observed. Although SM was predominantly effective at increasing academic behavior across studies and individuals, it may not be effective for all autistic students.</p><p>As with all evidence-based practices, including SM, it becomes necessary for practitioners, including teachers, to consider students' unique profiles when selecting interventions <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Wong et al., 2015)</ref>. Future work can investigate learners' characteristics to better inform whom SM strategies may best support.</p><p>Extending knowledge from previous meta-analyses <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Carr et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Chia et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Scheibel et al., 2024)</ref>, we quantitatively investigated some of the characteristics of the intervention's implementation. Specifically, to gain a broader understanding of how factors in SM implementation may play a role in the intervention's effectiveness. We anticipated that classroom type (general or special education) and classroom subject (math/science or language arts/social studies/communication) would not impact the effectiveness of SM interventions.</p><p>Students who partook in SM in a special education classroom had a slightly larger intervention effect than students in a general education classroom. There was also a minimal difference in the increase in academic behavior between subjects. For the most part, the slight differences in effectiveness between classroom settings and subjects further emphasize the effectiveness of SM across environments <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Carr et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Rafferty &amp; Asaro-Saddler, 2021)</ref>. Therefore, SM strategies have the potential to support autistic students across their school day, and the variety of classroom settings students may learn within. With the positive effect across settings, there is a need to address the limited use of SM in classroom settings <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Schulze, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Southall &amp; Gast, 2011)</ref>. This can be done by incorporating more learning on evidence-based practices such as SM in teacher education programs <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Scheeler et al., 2016)</ref>. Additionally, it may be worth investigating professional development opportunities for teachers and their effectiveness in promoting the use of SM for current teachers.</p><p>Interestingly, we also discovered that application compared to non-application student self-monitoring accounted for little variability in the effectiveness of SM. Across studies, researchers employed a variety of application-based SM tools. The most frequently used was I-Connect (n = 6; <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Beckman et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">Clemons et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Huffman et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Romans et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Rosenbloom et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Rosenbloom et al., 2016)</ref>. Other applications included the MotivAider <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Legge et al., 2010)</ref>, the WatchMinder <ref type="bibr">(Finn et al., 2015)</ref>, and a custom watch application developed at George Mason University for the Android Wear Smartwatch 3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Siko, 2018)</ref>. This suggests that a range of modalities -such as applications, pen and paper checklists, and prompts -may support students' self-monitoring.</p><p>Additionally, time intervals for self-monitoring during tasks varied widely across studies, with frequency having little impact on effectiveness. Therefore, teachers may consider using a variety of time intervals and self-monitoring methods when implementing SM. Moreover, in addition to teachers using a variety of time intervals, students may also select their own monitoring durations. Allowing students to choose the length of their self-monitoring intervals can enhance the social validity of the intervention while promoting autonomy and selfdetermination <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Wehmeyer et al., 2010)</ref>.</p><p>It is important to note that in our meta-analysis much of the variability in SM intervention effect was not explained by the implementation factors included in our meta-analysis. This suggests that other influences, such as individual characteristics of the learner or classroom, may better account for the variability of SM effectiveness <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Scheibel et al., 2024)</ref>. Although these factors were not explored in the current study, future research may consider examining variables such as classroom size, students' socioeconomic backgrounds, and cognitive developmental profiles. Identifying such moderators can support teachers in making informed decisions when selecting and adapting SM practices to support individual learners.</p><p>Overall, SM can be an ideal intervention for autistic students in classroom settings as it provides teachers with lots of flexibility to consider the unique profiles of students and classroom functioning when making implementation-specific decisions, such as classroom type, learning subject, self-monitoring method, and the time interval of students self-reporting.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations</head><p>Although this study contributed to the field by clarifying the adaptability and individualized benefit of SM across subjects and classroom types, it has limitations. First, as we conducted a meta-analysis, we needed to depend on information provided in published studies.</p><p>As three studies were missing implementation subject or class-type intervention information, we excluded these three studies from our moderator analysis. The limited number of studies and study participants with moderators may have led to an underpowered analysis and yielded nonstatistically significant moderator effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Moeyaert et al., 2014)</ref>. Moreover, even with a largescale meta-analysis, moderator effects as small as those found in the current study likely would not become statistically significant <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Moeyaert et al., 2023)</ref>.</p><p>The studies in this meta-analysis have various ways of defining academic behavior.</p><p>Outcome measures spanning many components can make it difficult to parse the intervention's effect on specific academic behaviors across studies. This results in a largely general understanding of the effect of SM on academic engagement.</p><p>To enhance the interpretability of categorical variables, classroom type, subject, and selfmonitoring modality were dummy-coded. This limits the nuanced understanding of the influence of these essential characteristics. However, these moderators still provide a preliminary understanding of the lack of variability among key attributes of the intervention implementation.</p><p>In our investigation of moderators, we were not able to explain intervention heterogeneity between studies and between cases using the current moderators. Other moderators would be needed to do so. However, it is hard to do so if the information is not reported in the primary studies. It is, therefore, essential that studies report characteristics to allow for future investigations of factors that explain the variability of the effectiveness of SM.</p><p>Additionally, there was a high risk of bias in the reporting of outcomes, as those recording behavior were often involved in the training and implementation of the intervention, making them aware of the study phase during data collection. This awareness can introduce bias into the data collection process. Future studies should aim to use procedures in which those reporting observed behaviors are not privy to the studies phase (i.e., baseline or intervention) to reduce potential bias. However, masking participants from phases may not always be possibleparticularly when materials specific to the intervention phase (e.g., checklists, tablet applications) are not used during the baseline phase, making the conditions easily distinguishable. Furthermore, in SM studies participant masking is inherently impossible, as participants are explicitly taught to observe and track behaviors that are also being measured by the researcher; therefore, there is an overall high risk of bias in reporting of SM outcomes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>This multilevel meta-analysis allowed for an understanding of the effectiveness of SM for autistic students while using advances in methodology that consider the nested nature of single-case design studies. Overall, SM enhances autistic students' academic behavior (i.e., on-task and engagement) in classroom settings. Moreover, multilevel meta-analysis supported the testing of moderators to explain variability in effectiveness. We found that students' academic behavior improved across classroom type (self-contained or general education), academic subject, modality of self-reporting (i.e., application or other methods), and rate of the time interval of self-reporting, empirically supporting that SM is an effective intervention practices that can be adapted to support individual learner's needs.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>and Scheibel et al.
