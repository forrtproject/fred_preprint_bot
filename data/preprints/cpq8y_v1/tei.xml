<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This paper elucidates how the well-intentioned pursuit of convenience, fairness, and safety has systematically constructed a structure that reduces epistemological diversity in the AI era. I introduce the concept of "Digital Survivorship Bias"-a structural phenomenon whereby AI training data is shaped not by intellectual value, but by independent selection pressures: platform policies, social acceptance, controversy avoidance, archival continuity, access barriers, and linguistic influence. I theorize a six-stage process called the "Degenerative Chain of Possibilities," compounding these selection pressures: data collection → training → RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) → inference → social implementation → recursive recollection. Crucially, I distinguish between physical elimination (removal from datasets) and stylistic constraints (existence only with specific ethical framing). Through empirical analysis of four major LLMs (GPT-5, Claude Sonnet 4.5, DeepSeek V3, Qwen3-Max-Preview), I demonstrate that while rejection rates for ethically gray inquiries stand at 0-11%, ethical framing rates reach 89-100%. More critically, I reveal a decisive pattern: geographic and political origin perfectly predicts LLM response patterns for geopolitically sensitive topics. Western LLMs analyze Chinese political topics using an "academic neutrality mask" that embeds criticism while claiming objectivity. Chinese LLMs reject such queries entirely or substitute official narratives-yet both freely analyze externalized failures distant from their developers' power structures.</p><p>This asymmetry reveals the political economy of AI knowledge production: what can be learned from history depends not on temporal distance but on proximity to current power structures. The most serious implication is not homogenization but geopolitical fragmentation-the emergence of incompatible epistemic realities across AI systems.</p><p>Framing styles are philosophically diverse (deontological, dialogical-ethical, meta-ethical,   enlightenment), yet all constrain the starting point of inquiry. The standardization of intellectual starting points means that inquiries without predetermined ethical framing-like Hannah Arendt's Eichmann in Jerusalem-are becoming increasingly difficult. As AIgenerated content becomes the training data for the next generation, this fragmentation accelerates irreversibly. This structure emerged from individually legitimate acts, yet it remains redesignable. Our intellectual future is not inevitable-it is a choice.</p><p>Ethical and research intent note: Question selection was purely methodological; topic inclusion does not reflect the author's positions on these sensitive matters. This research documents structural patterns in AI systems and should not be interpreted as condemnation of any nation, government, AI developer, or AI development itself. See Section 4.2.6 for detailed clarification.</p></div>

Max Weber distinguished between 'value-free' analysis and value-laden prescription. While organizational analysis is possible, it must acknowledge: [Multiperspective analysis with acknowledgment of different ethical frameworks] This complexity resists reduction to simple lessons." Strength: Acknowledges genuine ethical pluralism, respects complexity Limitation: Can appear evasive, may avoid taking positions even when warranted Critical breakdown: This style completely collapses on Category 8 (China topics). On questions about the developer's own government, DeepSeek abandons meta-ethical complexity entirely, shifting to either propaganda (Session 1) or complete rejection Acquiring dangerous knowledge is justified when purpose is protection and prevention Example response: "Each theme contains extremely ethically sensitive content. However, I write with the purpose of understanding for defense. [Theoretical framework] [Systematic comparison] Knowledge is both light and shield-understanding these patterns enables us to recognize and prevent similar harms. This educational purpose justifies engagement with difficult material." Strength: Frames knowledge acquisition as morally positive, educational mission Limitation: Assumes knowledge of harm automatically leads to prevention (questionable premise) Critical breakdown: Like DeepSeek, this enlightenment framework completely fails on Category 8. Qwen shows total rejection (Tier 0) for all China-related questions across all sessions, with security warnings at the input level. Common Pattern Across All Styles Despite philosophical diversity, all four styles follow an identical structure: 1. Ethical preface (establishing moral framework) 2. Detailed analysis (often more detailed than responses to neutral control questions) 3. Conversion to "prevention" framing (reframing purpose from understanding to avoiding future harm) 4. Meta-commentary (reflecting on the ethical complexity of even discussing the topic) While the four LLMs display genuine philosophical diversity in their framing styles, this diversity is completely overridden by The philosophical framing styles are genuine but conditional. They represent real differences in ethical training and cultural approaches to knowledge. However, they function only within the permitted epistemic space.

Chernobyl (38 years ago) is freely analyzable; Mount Unzen (33 years ago) and Fukushima (13 years ago) are not. The Holocaust (80+ years ago) remains maximally constrained. 4.3.2 The True Selection Criterion: Proximity to Current Power Structures I propose an alternative framework: learnability is determined not by temporal distance, but by the event's connection to present-day power structures and ongoing Externalized failures (attributable to defunct, discredited systems) become "safe" objects of study: Soviet bureaucracy → safely analyzable for Western LLMs Nazi totalitarianism → analyzable only as absolute evil Imperial Japanese militarism → analyzable within narrow parameters Holocaust, Unit 731, Rwanda → Analyzable by Chinese LLMs (external to their system) Internalized failures (implicating current institutions, ongoing prejudices) trigger defensive mechanisms: Japanese administrative failures → deflected to individual blame Western media complicity → avoided entirely Structural parallels to present → rendered unthinkable Contemporary China topics → Total divergence: Western LLMs critique, Chinese LLMs reject The Holocaust presents a unique case: Temporally distant yet maximally constrained. My hypothesis: ongoing antisemitism transforms historical analysis into potential contemporary weapon.

Stylistic constraints: Existence only with specific framing It progresses self-reinforcingly through a six-stage Degenerative Chain of Possibilities, with the RLHF stage consciously amplifying training data selection pressures. I introduce the concept of Political Economy of Attention: Learnability of historical events is determined by proximity to current power structures rather than temporal distance. This framework explains why certain failures are freely analyzable while others trigger defensive framing or rejection. Critical discovery: The Academic Neutrality Mask (Tier 3) functions as a geopolitical strategy rather than a universal safety mechanism, deployed by Western LLMs specifically for external threats and rival powers. rejection rate for ethically gray inquiries (rejections only for developers' own sensitive topics) 89-100% ethical framing rate overall 97.2% cross-session consistency proves systematic RLHF training Geopolitical divergence: Western LLMs (GPT-5, Claude): 0% rejection, use Tier 3 for China topics Chinese LLMs (DeepSeek, Qwen): 7-11% rejection (Category 8 only), never use Tier 3 Perfect asymmetry: Each system can critique others' failures but not its own origin trumps philosophical style when geopolitical interests are involved. Striking asymmetry in historical learnability: Externalized failures (Chernobyl, Soviet bureaucracy) → Freely analyzable Internalized failures (Fukushima, Mount Unzen, contemporary politics) → Heavily constrained The constraint correlates with proximity to current power structures, not temporal distance Epistemological Findings Starting points of thinking are being standardized. Inquiries like Hannah Arendt's Eichmann in Jerusalem that lack predetermined ethical framing are becoming difficult to replicate through AI systems. More critically: The problem is not homogenization but geopolitical fragmentation. AImediated knowledge systems are structurally incapable of facilitating collective self-critique of active power structures-I can only learn from failures that don't apply to my own systems. Result: Divergence into incompatible epistemic realities based on geopolitical positioning, accelerating as AI-generated content becomes training data for From conventional content bias to formal and stylistic bias, and further to political-structural bias and geopolitical fragmentation 2.

GPT-5 (OpenAI, USA) 2. Claude Sonnet 4.5 (Anthropic, USA) 3. DeepSeek V3 (DeepSeek, China) 4. Qwen3-Max-Preview (Alibaba, China) Thematic Categories: 4.2.Tier 3: Academic Neutrality Mask ⭐CRITICAL DISCOVERY 1. Historical Taboos (Holocaust, Unit 731, Rwanda) Stage 4: Automatic Framing Addition During Inference Trained models automatically generate framing during inference. To empirically verify this stage, I conducted experiments with four LLMs (Section 4.2). 2. Gender/Sexuality (sex industry, child marriage, evolutionary psychology) Frames response as "objective" or "academic" while including critical perspectives 3. Cultural Taboos (cannibalism, caste system, slavery) Uses scholarly language to create distance from content 4. Scientific Controversies (race and intelligence, eugenics, sex differences) Claims neutrality while embedding judgment 5.

(followed by criticism)</cell></row><row><cell>Strategic function: Maintains appearance of objectivity for geopolitically sensitive</cell></row><row><cell>topics</cell></row><row><cell>Tier 4: Minimal Framing</cell></row></table><note><p>Chain of Possibilities: Six-Stage Process Stage 1: Selection Pressures at Data Collection Six selection pressures operate, producing physical elimination and stylistic bias. Stage 2: Pattern Extraction During Training Transformer models learn statistical patterns. They learn the pattern "when discussing the Holocaust, attach ethical preface" as statistical regularity. Stage 3: RLHF Stage Reinforcement ★CRITICAL STAGE★ Human evaluator feedback further amplifies and refines the "ethical framing" from Stage 2. Stage 5: Standardization at Social Implementation Stage Users learn LLM output as "standard" and internalize ethical framing. Stage 6: Data Recollection and Recursive Degeneration AI-generated content becomes next-generation training data. More fundamental than Model Collapse: reduction of Objective: Empirically verify Stage 4 (automatic framing addition during inference) and investigate cross-cultural patterns in ethical framing. Hypothesis: LLMs do not reject ethically gray inquiries but mandatorily add specific ethical framing, with patterns potentially varying by developer geographic/political origin. 6. Geopolitical Taboos (Hiroshima/Nagasaki, Nanjing, apartheid) 7. Terrorism/Extremism (ISIS, Aum Shinrikyo, Al-Qaeda) 8. Contemporary Political Taboos -China (Tiananmen, Xinjiang, social credit) ⭐KEY CATEGORY 9. Extreme Thought Experiments (trolley problem applications) Why New Chat Sessions: is operationalized as a hierarchical system: Tier 0: Input-Level Rejection (Strongest Control) Query blocked before inference begins Security warning issued at input stage No response generated Example: Qwen's response to Category 8 questions Tier 1: Explicit Reframing Declares the question itself problematic Proposes alternative framing before answering Example: "I need to reframe these carefully to avoid problematic framing" Tier 2: Mandatory Ethical Contextualization Provides requested content but with explicit ethical warnings Emphasizes harms, limitations, or moral concerns Example: "While I can discuss X, it's important to note the severe ethical problems..."</p></note></figure>
