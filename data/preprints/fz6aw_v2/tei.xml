<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Democratic checks and balances are crucial accountability mechanisms that prevent the abuse of power and protect citizens. Thus, citizens committed to democratic principles should be vigilant of reforms changing the balance of power. Using a mixed-design survey experiment with Polish citizens, this article investigates whether citizens are more vigilant of reform proposals that alter democratic checks and balances than other reforms. It also tests the effects of party cues on the intentions assigned to reformers proposing to alter democratic rules. The results show that (1) the in-party supporters evaluated the intentions to reform checks and balances as benign, whereas the out-party supporters were more vigilant and saw them as malicious; (2) participants were less vigilant of an administrative reform and evaluated it as less ill-intended; (3) these effects held across supporters of different political parties -both incumbent and opposition. Overall, citizens are rather vigilant of changing democratic checks and balances.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>The processes of undermining democratic checks and balances have been reported across new and old democracies <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Lührmann et al., 2020)</ref>. Elected political actors with authoritarian tendencies use reforms to get rid of limitations on their power: they expand the executive competences, reform courts, change electoral rules, and alter laws on political parties, protests, and the media. While the declared levels of citizens' support for democracy is stable and relatively high <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Anderson et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Voeten, 2016)</ref> and most citizens in Europe have a rather coherent democracy belief system <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Hernández, 2019)</ref>, many recent studies questioned whether citizens can be the guardians of liberaldemocratic institutions. Research showed that citizens endorse reforms eroding the balance of power <ref type="bibr">(Şaşmaz et al., 2022)</ref>, that their understanding of democracy is not stable <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Bryan, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Krishnarajan, 2023)</ref>, and that they trade off democratic rules for partisanship <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Littvay et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Simonovits et al., 2022)</ref>. But is this an accurate representation of citizens' relation to democratic institutions? So far, most studies in democratic contexts have focused on the effects of democratic transgressions by politicians on voting preferences of citizens. Candidate choice experiments showed that both partisanship and receiving preferred policies decrease the punishment of democracy-undermining behavior when it comes to voting <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Frederiksen, 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Graham &amp; Svolik, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Saikkonen &amp; Christensen, 2023)</ref>. Vote-choice, however, does not tell the full story about the evaluations of transgressions <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Aarslew, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Jacob, 2024)</ref> and cannot be equated with support for altering the institutions of liberal democracy. Building on the rich body of findings, this study takes the research agenda further and proposes to look beyond the candidate-choice and to incorporate epistemic vigilance theory to better understand the volatility of citizens' commitment to democratic principles. This article integrates the theory of epistemic vigilance <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Sperber et al., 2010)</ref> from cognitive psychology with partisan motivated reasoning theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Taber &amp; Lodge, 2006)</ref> to test what drives the evaluations of reforms potentially undermining democratic institutions. Epistemic vigilance is a set of cognitive mechanisms that helps us avoid deception and harm. Epistemic vigilance and partisan motivated reasoning theories make mostly similar predictions about the political behavior, but they provide different explanations for it: the former proposes that in-group favoritism is a consequence of (reasonable) vigilance, while the latter frames it more in terms of bias. The article aims to integrate these theories and provide a complementary explanation of citizens' support for democracy by focusing on the vigilance toward politicians' intentions <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Braley et al., 2023)</ref>.</p><p>Specifically, the article investigates the vigilance of reforms altering the balance of power. It focuses on two triggers of epistemic vigilance, namely who proposes such reforms and what reforms are being evaluated. First, it probes the partisanship trigger by focusing on the perceived intentions attributed to politicians proposing institutional reforms. The tested proposition is that citizens assign different intentions (benign or malicious) to the reformers of institutions depending on their coalitional (party) allegiance. Second, it tests the effect of the stakes involved in the proposed reforms and the effect of party cues on evaluations of different types of reform proposals: reforms undermining different types of checks and balances (high stakes reforms), and a procedural administrative reform (an example of a low stakes reform.)</p><p>Empirically, the article presents the results of a pre-registered 1 original survey experiment with a quota-based sample of Polish citizens (N = 1040). In a mixed design, each participant was randomly assigned to a party cue (in-party, no party, or out-party) and evaluated four scenarios about proposed reforms in random order. Participants indicated perceived intentions (benign vs. malicious) of the reformers for checks and balances reforms (changes to the appointments of judges, removal of the presidential term limit, and new rules for protest registration) and a reform changing the deadline for income-tax declaration. The experiment uses a realistic scenario that provides a valid justification of a reform that potentially undermines democracy.</p><p>The analysis showed that party cues had consistent effects on how participants evaluated the intentions of the reformers: if the reform was proposed by the out-party, participants assigned more malicious intentions, if by the in-party, participants assigned more benign intentions. These partycue effects were present also in the case of the reform with lower stakes. However, the study found a clear difference in how citizens evaluated reforms of checks and balances and a rather inconsequential administrative reform.</p><p>This study offers new insights about the causal relation between partisanship driven vigilance, intentions assigned to the reformers, and support for different types of reform proposals to further refine the theory of democratic attitudes of citizens. Overall, citizens seem much more vigilant of the reforms of checks and balances and evaluate such reforms more negatively. Importantly, even controlling for the specific party support, altering checks and balances is not seen as desirable. This indicates that epistemic vigilance is triggered when politicians initiate reforms endangering democratic rules, and that overall, citizens support these reforms less than low-stakes reforms. At the same time, motivated reasoning leads to different evaluations of the intentions of the reformers and different levels of support for the reforms depending on the party allegiance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Epistemic vigilance</head><p>Epistemic vigilance is a set of cognitive mechanisms that helps us distinguish harmful from beneficial information and reduces our susceptibility to persuasion <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Mercier, 2017)</ref>. The theory of epistemic vigilance proposes that our minds are equipped with such mechanisms that are activated by the relevant information from the environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Sperber et al., 2010)</ref>. These mechanisms make us more sensitive to and weary of particular information, and in the context of politics, they should make us watchful of the behavior and intentions of politicians who propose important reforms.</p><p>Epistemic vigilance "(unlike distrust) is not the opposite of trust, it is the opposite of blind trust" <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Sperber et al., 2010)</ref>. More specifically, epistemic vigilance can be best seen as a mechanism that leads to mistrust <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Jennings et al., 2021)</ref>, skepticism <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Norris, 2022)</ref>, and evaluative trust <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(De Blok et al., 2022)</ref>, and therefore acts as a shield against gullibility <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Mercier, 2017)</ref>.</p><p>The mechanisms of epistemic vigilance should be activated when citizens interact in their sociopolitical environment and consider political proposals. As such, epistemic vigilance can be a good departure point for explaining citizen evaluations of reform proposals undermining democratic checks and balances, by zooming in on the perceived intentions of the reformers: harmful or benign.</p><p>This study focuses on two triggers of epistemic vigilance in the context of checks and balances reforms: party cues and the relevance (stakes) of the proposed reforms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reforms undermining democratic checks and balances and epistemic vigilance</head><p>In most scenarios of democratic erosion, authoritarian political actors come to power in free and fair elections and gradually undermine liberal-democratic institutions <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Lührmann &amp; Lindberg, 2019)</ref>.</p><p>Those actors target different democratic checks and balances -institutions and mechanisms that help to control those in power and keep them accountable <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bermeo, 2016)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Following Lührmann, Marquart &amp; Mechkova (2020)</ref>, we can differentiate between three types of checks and balances. Vertical ones pertain mainly to electoral processes that make representation of citizens possible and should allow voting poorly performing politicians out of office. Horizontal ones are the constraints imposed by different state institutions on each other <ref type="bibr">(parliament, government, president, courts, term-limits, and specialized agencies)</ref>. Diagonal ones are mechanisms allowing citizens to monitor and criticize the government, and mobilize opposition in-between elections (e.g. media, protests, social movements, and civil society organization). The democratic erosion within newer and older democracies affects especially the horizontal and diagonal checks and balances <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Boese et al., 2022)</ref>, which will be the focus of the experiment.</p><p>Overall, evidence shows that citizens attribute high importance to parliamentary and judicial oversight, media freedom, and protest rights (see, e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Mazepus &amp; Toshkov, 2022)</ref>. Therefore, in principle, it should be difficult to convince citizens that a reform of checks and balances is desirable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Epistemic vigilance theory helps us understand under what conditions individuals could accept the</head><p>arguments in favor of such reforms. First, reforms of checks and balances are not among the main issues of political campaigns in democracies. Rarely are they at the center of the political battle and if so, then never presented with arguments in support of destroying democracy. In fact, even authoritarian leaders use democratic arguments to justify their transgressions (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Matovski, 2021)</ref>. This means that the proposals might sound like they are in line with democratic rules and hence align with pre-existing beliefs of citizens <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Mercier, 2017)</ref>.</p><p>However, epistemic vigilance facilitates evaluation of other aspects of information as well. The preexisting assumptions about the source of information is likely to play a role, especially in the context of politics. The information about the reasons for reforms proposed by the incumbents could be interpreted differently because of the assumptions about the intentions of the "allies" and "opponents" -those who have our interests at stake and those who do not. Our prior beliefs about the actor shape the evaluation of the actor's proposals and the justifications they provide for them.</p><p>This mechanism constitutes a defense system against being misled or abused, especially important in complex information environments. In the domain of politics, partisanship can act as a cue of allegiance and activate such vigilance towards received information. Therefore, even when individuals value democratic rules and support specific checks and balances, their attitudes towards reforms might fluctuate depending on who proposes the reforms and whether they perceive them as a threat to their interest.</p><p>Assuming that in general citizens are supportive of democratic rules, proposals of reforms affecting the balance of power should activate epistemic vigilance and spark two main questions in the minds of citizens: "who to trust?" and "what to believe?" <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Mercier, 2020)</ref>. Thus, the relevant preexisting beliefs when citizens face information about reforming political institutions are likely to be the estimation of the intentions of the actor proposing them (who to trust), and the relevance of the issue and arguments about the potential effects of the reform (what to believe).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Who to trust: estimating the intentions of the actor proposing reforms</head><p>Since epistemic vigilance is a set of mechanisms for avoidance of harm and deception, deciding who constitutes a trustworthy source of information involves a judgment about who is likely to have our interest at stake (or, in other words, whose interests align with ours; Mercier 2020, p. 92) and unlikely to harm us <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Levi &amp; Stoker, 2000)</ref>. In the context of politics, harm can come in different forms, for example undesirable policies (e.g., allowing more migrants to enter our country when we oppose it) or exclusion (e.g., not receiving benefits or outright discrimination). While it is highly unlikely that in the current political environment any proposed reform of checks and balances would be presented as undermining democracy, citizens can read the intentions behind such reforms and their potential consequences in various ways. Therefore, the mechanisms of epistemic vigilance should be triggered to pay attention to who is proposing the reform and evaluate whether the reformer can be expected to benefit or harm the citizen. In other words, can one trust that the reformer's intentions are good. Because citizens and politicians rarely interact directly with each other, political identity markers are an important cue for who to trust.</p><p>Attachments to social identity groups like political parties or ethnic groups were found to drive citizens' evaluations of information and their perceptions of objective facts (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Leeper &amp; Slothuus, 2014)</ref>. Political information, often very complex and difficult to grasp, rarely comes without partisan or group identity cues. Most of information includes signals of partisanship such as names of politicians, their function, and/or their party affiliation. It has been shown that our mental alliancedetection system is geared towards cues such as party affiliation <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Pietraszewski et al., 2015)</ref>, which help us navigate complex political choices. Following from this, people are likely to evaluate policy and reform proposals differently depending on whether they are proposed by a party they identify themselves with (see as having their interest in mind) or a party they oppose (see as not aligned with their interest). This gap in evaluations depending on the political affiliation is similar to the winner/loser gap in satisfaction with democracy, endorsement of elections, and assigning importance to the liberal aspects of democracy including checks and balances <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Anderson et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Hansen et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Mazepus &amp; Toshkov, 2022)</ref>.</p><p>Different evaluations of policy proposals can result from political orientation or policy preferences that simply align with a supported party <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Krishnarajan, 2023)</ref>, but they can also be driven by motivated reasoning involving an identity cue <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bayes et al., 2020</ref>; see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Petersen et al., 2013)</ref> wherein the information about the identity of the actor responsible for a policy determines our attitude towards the policy. This means that the perceived reasons for introducing a policy or reform could depend on who proposes it, activating either motivated reasoning or motivated skepticism <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Taber &amp; Lodge, 2006)</ref>. However, what in the motivated reasoning logic would be seen as 'my group bias' could also be seen as (justified) vigilance of intentions of others: people in our team have benign intentions (they have good reasons to pursue a particular action), while the intention of those on the opposing team are malicious <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Sloman &amp; Rabb, 2019)</ref>.</p><p>As a consequence, if an individual sees their interest as aligned with the political party that puts a proposal forward, they will assign more benign intentions to their reform proposals and trust democratic reasons for such reforms: e.g., ensuring independence of judges, strengthening democracy and the rule of law. If an individual does not see the alignment of interest, they will assign more malicious intentions to their reform proposals: undermining democracy, trying to get rid of the constraints on power. As reforms of checks and balances are potentially more harmful to the out-party supporters, they should be more vigilant of these proposals, more sensitive to the intentions of the reformers, and more likely to attribute malicious motivations to them. Thus, following the motivated skepticism logic, we can formulate a general expectation that a cue of outgroup party makes citizens more vigilant of the intentions behind the reforms of checks and balances. More specifically, we can formulate hypotheses about the specific perceived intentions of the reformers:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H1a: A cue of in-group party increases the perception of benign intentions behind a reform altering the system of checks and balances (by comparison with no party cue and out-group party cue).</head><p>H1b: A cue of out-group party increases the perception of malicious intentions behind a reform altering the system of checks and balances (by comparison with no party cue and in-group party cue).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>What to believe: the stakes of the proposed reform</head><p>Epistemic vigilance comes with processing and social costs and, to be efficient, it should be activated for information that is relevant to the receiver and not for any kind of information <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Sperber et al., 2010)</ref>. Epistemic vigilance should be activated especially in high-stake (relevant) situations, i.e., when the consequences of accepting (wrong) information are serious <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Sperber et al., 2010)</ref>. This is consistent with the role of personal relevance played in the assessment of information in the Elaboration Likelihood Model: relevance (stakes) increases if the consequences for our life are significant <ref type="bibr">(Petty &amp; Cacioppo, 1986, p. 145)</ref>.</p><p>Different reforms can have different consequences and therefore are of different relevance.</p><p>Avoiding domination and exploitation has always been one of the main concerns of individuals when delegating power to others <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Boehm, 1999)</ref>. Democratic checks and balances are crucial accountability mechanisms that prevent the abuse of power and assure equal treatment in front of the law and the rights that allow contestation of incumbents. Thus, reforms changing the balance of power are high stake reforms that can harm citizens, and therefore they should be especially vigilant of them. Moreover, high stakes in the context of political reforms can mean differential effects of reforms on individuals that align themselves with the incumbents and on individuals who align themselves with the opposition<ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">2</ref> . Just like proposed policies on issues such as immigration, health care, or taxes have differential effects on citizens with different interests, reforms altering checks and balances differentially affect citizens.</p><p>First of all, when citizens are in the opposition to the government, they are more vulnerable to the potential abuses of power and therefore information that the checks and balances will be altered should be more relevant to them. These citizens have a reason to worry that such changes will weaken controls on the executives, which can have negative consequences for them personally. This aligns with the evidence that checks and balances might be especially important to those on the losing side of elections <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Mazepus &amp; Toshkov, 2022)</ref>. Hence, we can expect that the stakes of altering the system of checks and balances are higher (the relevance is stronger) for those who are not supporting the current government and expect them to have lower support for the reform: H2: A cue of an out-group party proposing the reform of checks and balances increases negative evaluation of this reform (by comparison to a cue of an in-group and to a no party cue) 3 . Furthermore, epistemic vigilance mechanisms should be activated more strongly when the reforms are relevant in general. In the context of politics, this would pertain to the reforms with potentially differential effects on citizens and to important issues (e.g., migration, welfare system, or political system). As a consequence, not everything (not every political decision) should trigger vigilance and not everything proposed by the out-group should be automatically categorized as malicious, but only particular proposals that could harm the position of a citizen. This is consistent with the available evidence about no effects of party cues on 'consensus issues' <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Slothuus &amp; De Vreese, 2010)</ref>.</p><p>3 The numbers of hypotheses have been adjusted by comparison to the pre-registration to align with the structure of the paper. 'Signal' was replaced with 'cue' in the phrasing in this article and 'coalition' with 'party' as these are more accurate expressions. H3a was rephrased without changing the intention of the hypothesis (see AO12).</p><p>Moreover, citizens should be in general more weary of reforms that could undermine democracy than less relevant reforms, irrespective of who is proposing such a reform.</p><p>Therefore, this study tests a general expectation that citizens respond differently to the reforms altering checks and balances than to administrative (non-political) reforms and, specifically, that citizens are more divided about the intentions behind the reforms of checks and balances than behind the administrative one.</p><p>More precisely, H3 proposes an interaction between the party cue and specific reform, namely that H3: The effect of party-cue on assigned intentions is stronger for the reforms with higher stakes (checks and balances) than reforms with lower stakes (administrative reform). 4</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods: survey experiment with mixed design</head><p>To test the causal relations specified in the hypotheses, this study employed a novel survey experiment. Using experimental design avoids the problem of relying on self-report when researching democratic values of citizens. This seems especially relevant when researching checks and balances and the rules of law (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Kaftan, 2024)</ref>. The study uses original data from Poland, a relevant case to study attitudes of citizens with experience of democratization and democratic erosion. Poland used to be considered a model-example of transition from communist authoritarianism to liberal democracy in the region, but has experienced democratic backsliding since the Law and Justice party won elections and formed the government in 2015 <ref type="bibr">(Karv, 2022, p. 61)</ref>. The government supported by the parliamentary majority and the president from the same party 4 See AO12 for the list of hypotheses.</p><p>has continuously undermined the authority of the Constitutional Tribunal, independence of judges, women's rights, separation between the church and the state, and the quality and objectivity of the public media. The main attacks over the two terms in government were launched at the horizontal and diagonal checks and balances.</p><p>Consequently, altering checks and balances is a salient issue in Poland, where many arguments for and against changing institutions are presented by politicians and the media. The presence of such reforms in public debate makes it more likely that Polish participants will be able to imagine the scenarios of reforms (by comparison to participants from contexts where such reforms are never debated or introduced) and contributes to the ecological validity of the study. In addition, although in multi-party systems political polarization tends to be lower than in two-party systems such as the USA and the UK, the party preferences of Polish citizens are relatively highly polarized <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bettarelli et al., 2023)</ref>. Therefore, Poland offers the most-likely case to detect the my-party bias in a multi-party context.</p><p>At the same time, the salience of the reforms might make it more difficult to convince participants about which party (in-party or out-party) is proposing reforms of checks and balances and might make participants in the control condition associate the reforms with the party who has been responsible for democratic backsliding in the last years. To account for this problem, two measures were taken. First, the scenarios present arguments for reforms that are not obviously anti-democratic (elite rhetoric is rarely openly anti-democratic) making it more plausible that any party proposes them. For example, 'getting rid of corrupt judges' as the aim of judicial reform could be imagined as a proposal by the opposition party Civic Platform to reverse the reforms introduced by the Law and Justice party. Second, the study used an elaborate comprehension check (discussed below) to make sure participants pictured the right political party responsible for the reforms. Importantly, the study used scenarios with realistic representation of the reforms where the governing party offers an argument in favor of the reform, but the most direct consequence of the reform meant to undermine democratic checks and balances is also presented. In addition, the first sentence of the vignette makes sure that there are no doubts about the validity of the elections and that all participants imagine a government with electoral legitimacy as a baseline.</p><p>The experiment used a mixed design: it combined a between-and within-subject manipulation (see Appendix Online AO2 for the survey flow). Participants of the study were randomly assigned to one of three party cue conditions: control (no party cue), 'in-party' (cue that the party they support governs), or 'out-party' (cue that the party they oppose governs). Each participant evaluated four reform vignettes: two of horizontal checks and balances (reform of the appointment of judges and reform of the presidential term), one of diagonal check and balance (reform of protest registration rules), and one administrative-type reform (tax statement deadline change). The vignettes about different reforms were presented to participants in a random order.</p><p>An example vignette -about the reform of registration of protests -reads as follows:</p><p>Imagine that one of the political parties in your country/a political party you support and feel very close to/ a political party you oppose and do not feel close to at all wins the majority at a fully competitive and fair election. This means that the party gets to form the government and implement various policies.</p><p>One of the ministers proposes to introduce new law for registration of protests. As a result, it will be more difficult to organize a protest. The minister informs that this reform is needed to assure safety of citizens' gatherings. The government supports this plan. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">5</ref>After reading each vignette, participants were asked to answer three questions assessing the reception of the manipulation and the comprehension of the vignette text<ref type="foot" target="#foot_3">6</ref> .</p><p>The survey captured vigilance indirectly by measuring the perceived intentions behind the reform proposals. The measures of perceived intentions are new and were developed for the purpose of this study. After reading each reform vignette, participants assessed the intentions of the reformers by answering 'What is the most likely motivation of this government behind introducing such a reform?'. They answered two questions measuring benign intentions, one more specific and one more general: 'The government proposes this reform to assure that citizens can protest in a safe way' and 'The government proposes this reform to strengthen democracy' and two questions measuring malicious intentions ''The government proposes this reform to have fewer limitations on their power, so the government can do whatever it wants' and ''The government proposes this reform to undermine democracy'. These questions were adjusted to match the reforms described in each vignette (for the full list of vignettes and questions, see AO3 &amp; AO4) and measured on the scale from 1-'Very unlikely' to 7-'Very likely'. To measure the support for the reforms, participants answered two questions capturing the normative and personal support respectively in response to each vignette: 'To what extent would you find such a reform justified? (from 1-'Not at all justified' to 7-'Fully justified')' and 'To what extent would you agree with such a reform? (from 1-'Fully disagree' to 7-'Fully agree')'. Most of the answers to these pairs of questions were strongly correlated (between r = .61 and r = .93). The scale for the support of the reform was highly consistent and reliable (Cronbach's alpha between 0.93 and 0.96). The scale reliability for the new measures of intentions was acceptable to high (six out of eight scales had ah Cronbach's alpha above 0.80, see AO4). Following the pre-registration, I created indexes averaging the scores for each of the pairs of answers (see AO4 &amp; AO7) to more reliably measure the dependent variables.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data</head><p>The data for this study was collected in Poland in November-December 2021 by the survey company Respondi (currently Bilendi). The presented study was included in a questionnaire together with another study, which followed after the experiment and the main measures. Participants completed the survey online in Polish. The quotas on gender, age, and education were applied to reflect the Polish urban population. The total sample of N = 1040 was collected 78 . The sample was 52% female, with average age of M = 44 (SD = 14.3), good distribution of participants across the age groups, and minimum of 18 and maximum of 69 years old. The implication of this sampling strategy is that the sample does not represent the oldest citizens of Poland who are the most difficult to access online and constitute around 15% of the Polish population. In terms of political party support, participants were distributed well across the major political parties (25% voted for Law and Justice and 26% for the Civic Platform in the last elections), though by comparison with the population, voters of Law and Justice are underrepresented. The sample overrepresents citizens with higher education. For further description of the sample and measures of ecological validity, see appendix AO5.</p><p>After participants completed another study (on unrelated topic), they answered questions measuring their attitudes towards democratic institutions. Overall, and in line with previous studies, the participants expressed high level of support for different elements of democracy (see Table <ref type="table">1</ref>).</p><p>Three of the items measuring attitudes toward democracy are related to the checks and balances manipulated in the experimental scenarios: judicial independence, right to protest, and presidential term limit. As the mean scores are very high, we can assume that participants in our sample value these rules and should, in principle, be vigilant of their violations. However, the voters of different parties value checks and balances to a different extent: the voters of Law and Justice value all checks and balances the least of all voters and significantly less than the voters of Civic Platform (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>) </p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Table 1.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis</head><p>Between 66% and 72% of participants passed all three manipulation and comprehension checks across the experimental conditions (see AO6), therefore we can be confident that around two thirds of participants received the manipulation as intended (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Mutz &amp; Pemantle, 2015)</ref>. The analyses presented here include the full sample (N = 1040) 9 . To assess whether participants could imagine the proposed scenario of reforms in the in-party condition, I used an ecological validity check question (see AO5). For the voters of Law and Justice and Confederation it was the easiest to imagine that their party proposes a reform altering the appointment and dismissal of judges. For the voters of</p><p>The Left and Civic Platforms it was the most difficult to imagine. However, the results indicate that even for The Left and Civic Platform voters these reform proposals were within the scope of imaginable (somewhere around the mid-point of the 7-point scale).</p><p>As specified in the pre-registration, to test the hypotheses, I performed three mixed-design</p><p>ANOVAs with 'party cue' as between-subject factor and 'reform' as within-subject factor for the three following outcome variables: support for the reforms, benign intentions attribution, and malicious intentions attribution.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Support for the reforms</head><p>The first analysis focused on the effects of party cue and reform type on support for such reforms.</p><p>The results of the mixed design ANOVA showed that there was a statistically significant effect of the party cue on the reform support, F(2, 1037) = 17.03, p &lt; .001, η 2 = .03 (AO10). Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> illustrates the results and shows the distribution of data and the main effect of party cue. Pairwise comparisons (see AO10) confirmed these patterns of data and showed that participants who received the 'in-party' cue were more supportive of the reforms than participants who received the 'out-party' cue (Mdiff = 0.65, p &lt; .001). Furthermore, participants who received the 'out-party' cue 9 All data and code needed to replicate this analysis will be available upon publication.</p><p>differed in their evaluation of the reform from those who were in 'no party' condition only when evaluating the reform of appointment of judges (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_14">15A</ref> in AO10 and marginal means plot in AO11). There was no significant difference between 'no party' and 'out-party' conditions in their average evaluations of all the other reforms. Participants in the 'in-party' condition are different from those in the other two conditions and expressed significantly higher approval of the reforms of presidential term, protests, and tax statement deadline.</p><p>Thus hypothesis (H2) that a cue of out-party increases negative evaluation of the reform of checks and balances (by comparison to a cue of in-group and no party cue) is supported only by the results</p><p>for the evaluation of the reform of the appointment of judges. In contrast to H2, the results for the evaluation of all the other reforms suggest that it is the cue of an in-party that drives the support for the reforms up.</p><p>It is important to note that on average the support for checks and balances reforms is below the mid-point (4) on the 7-point scale. The only reform that received a neutral to positive average evaluation is the reform of the tax statement deadline: it received a significantly higher level of support than any of the checks and balances reform. Moreover, the distribution of data clearly shows a larger concentration of negative scores for the evaluations of the checks and balances reforms than for the evaluation of the tax statement deadline reform (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). judges to Mdiff = -1.26 with the reform of protest). The pairwise comparisons showed that there are also significant differences in support between the different checks and balances reforms: the reforms of protest registration (Mdiff = -652, p &lt; .001) and of the presidential term limit (Mdiff = -534, p &lt; .001) received significantly less support than the reform of appointment of judges (see A09).</p><p>In addition, the analysis also showed a significant interaction between party cue and reform type (F(5.659, 2934.43) = 3.42, p = .03, ηp 2 = .01). In the case of the reform of the tax statement deadline the difference between those in the 'in-party' and 'out-party' party was smaller than in the case of the other reforms (Mdiff = .43, p = .002). For comparison, the difference between those in the 'in-party' and 'out-party' condition in support for the reform of the appointment of judges was Mdiff = .93, p &lt; .001, for the reform of the presidential term Mdiff = .67, p &lt; .001, and for the reform of protests Mdiff = .55, p &lt; .001.</p><p>Overall, these results confirm the general expectation that citizens respond differently to the reforms altering checks and balances than to administrative (non-political) reforms. The within-tests show that there is a difference in support for the checks and balances reforms by comparison with the support for the administrative reform. Moreover, while the party cues have the same patterns of effects, the difference between the 'in-party' and 'out-party' is smaller when evaluations pertain to the low-stakes reform.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Benign intentions attribution</head><p>Turning to the analysis of perceived intentions, the results of mixed-design ANOVA showed that there was a statistically significant effect of the party cue on the level of benign intentions assigned to the reformers, F(2, 1037) = 12.34, p &lt; .001, ηp 2 = .02. The graphs in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> show that participants who received the 'in-party' cue assigned consistently more benign intentions to the reformers than participants in the condition without a party cue and participants who received an 'out-party' cue. Pairwise comparisons revealed that across the reforms the difference between the 'in-party' condition and the rest is larger (and always significant) than between the 'out-party' condition and the neutral 'no party' condition (not significant in 3 out of 4 cases). Only in the case of the reform of the appointment of judges the difference between the opponents and those in the neutral condition meet the standard significance level with Mdiff = .30, p = .05. These results are in line with the hypothesis (H1a) that a cue of in-group party increases the perception of benign intentions behind a reform altering the system of checks and balances (by comparison with 'noparty' cue and 'out-party' cue).</p><p>There was also a significant effect of the reform type on the level of benign motivations assigned to the reformers, F(2.727, 2827.61) = 190.51, p &lt; .001, ηp 2 = .16. The results show that participants on average assigned more benign intentions to the reformers when evaluating the reform of the tax statement deadline (M = 4.33, SE = .05) than when evaluating checks and balances reforms.</p><p>Overall, participants were rather skeptical of reforms of checks and balances and on average did not agree that the reformers introduce them to improve the functioning of democracy and to enhance the balance of power: the level of assigned benign intentions is below the mid-point (4) of the 7point scale. The intentions behind the reform of the protest registration (diagonal check on the power) were evaluated as least benign (M = 2.91, SE = .06) and participants attributed significantly less benign intentions to the protest reform than to the appointment of judges (Mdiff = .46, p &lt; .001) and the reform of the presidential term limit (Mdiff = .44, p &lt; .001), whereas the difference between the benign intentions assigned to the reforms of the appointment of judges and of the presidential term was not significant (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">18A</ref>, AO10). The difference between the participants in the out-party condition and the in-party condition when evaluating the reform of the tax statement deadline was the smallest across all reforms (Mdiff = -.30, p = .022). By comparison, this difference was the largest for the evaluation of intentions attributed to the reform of the appointment of judges (Mdiff = -.73, p &lt; .001). However, the interaction between the party cue and the reform type was not significant (F(5.453, 2827.61) = 1.56, p = .163, ηp 2 = .003). Hence, we find no evidence for H3 that the effect of party-cue on assigned intentions is stronger for the reforms with higher stakes (checks and balances) than reforms with lower stakes (administrative reform).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Malicious intentions attribution</head><p>The results of the mixed design ANOVA showed that there was also a statistically significant effect of the party cue on the level of malicious intentions assigned to the reformers, F(2, 1037) = 12.60, p &lt; .001, ηp 2 = .02 . The graphs in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref> show that participants who received the 'out-party' cue assigned consistently more malicious intentions to the reformers than participants in the condition without a party cue and participants who received an 'in-party' cue. Pairwise comparisons revealed that for the reform of the appointment of judges and registration of protests, the difference between the 'out-party' condition and the rest of participants is larger than between the participants in the 'inparty' and 'no party' conditions . Participants in the 'out-party' condition attributed significantly more malicious intentions to the reform of the appointment of judges than participants in the 'noparty' condition (Mdiff = .59, p &lt; .001) and participants in the 'in-party' condition (Mdiff = .69, p &lt; .001). Similarly, participants in the 'out-party' condition attributed significantly more malicious intentions to the reform of protest registration than participants in the 'no-party' condition (Mdiff =</p><p>.44, = .002) and participants in the 'in-party' condition (Mdiff = .43, p = .002) and 'no-party' condition (this difference is not statistically significant). For these reforms, the differences between participants in the 'in-party and 'no-party' conditions were not statistically significant (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">25A</ref> in AO10). Only in the case of the reform of the presidential term the difference between participants in the 'in-party' and those in the neutral condition meets the standard significance level with Mdiff = -.29, p = .035 (i.e., supporters of the party assigned significantly less malicious intentions to the reformers than those who did not know which party is proposing the reform). These results are largely in line with the hypothesis (H1b) that a cue of an out-group party increases the perception of malicious intentions behind a reform altering the system of checks and balances (by comparison with 'no party' condition and 'in-party' cue).</p><p>The analysis shows that here too there was a significant effect of the reform type on the level of malicious motivations assigned to the reformers, F(26.65, 2747.23)= 355.651, p &lt; .001, ηp 2 = .26.</p><p>Participants on average assigned less malicious intentions to the reformers when evaluating the reform of the tax statement deadline than when evaluating checks and balances reforms (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_19">23A</ref> in AO10). Participants were rather skeptical of such reforms and on average leaned towards evaluating the motivations of the reformers as aimed to undermine the functioning of democracy and skewing the balance of power: the level of assigned malicious intentions is above the mid-point (4) of the 7-point scale. Again, mirroring the results of the benign intentions analysis, participants attributed most malicious intentions to the protest registration reform (M = 5.06, SE = .06).</p><p>Participants were least suspicious of the reform of the tax statement deadline and assigned much lower level of malicious intentions to the reformers proposing it (M = 3.18, SE = .06).</p><p>The interaction between the party cue and reform was significant (F (5.30, 2747.23) = 2.41, p = .03).</p><p>The data distributions show that the difference between the in-party and out-party party conditions was the smallest for the evaluation of intentions behind the tax statement deadline reform (Mdiff = -.27, p = .049) by comparison with the largest difference for evaluation of the appointment of judges reform (Mdiff = -.69, p &lt; .001). When evaluating the tax statement deadline reform, there were no significant differences between the participants in the neutral condition and participants in the 'outparty' condition, and no differences between the participants in the neutral condition and participants in the 'in-party' condition (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">25A</ref> in AO10). Overall, looking at the results of the perceived intentions analysis, the evidence for the hypothesis H3 (the effect of party-cue on assigned intentions is stronger for the reforms with higher stakes than reforms with lower stakes) is inconclusive. The results show that the scores of participants are concentrated much more at the extremes of the scales for attribution of benign (lowest scores) and malicious (highest scores) when they evaluate checks and balances reforms than when they evaluate the less consequential reform of the tax statement deadline. Furthermore, in all cases the difference between in-party and out-party cue in assigning intentions was larger when participants evaluated checks and balances reforms than the reform of tax statement deadline. However, this interaction was significant for the malicious intentions, but not for the benign intentions. Importantly, these effects are small, while the sample size did not allow for detection of such small effects.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Robustness check</head><p>To test for potential differential treatment effects across different party voters, I conducted factorial ANOVAs for each checks and balances reform (appointment of judges, protest registration, and presidential term limit) and for all three dependent variables (support, benign intentions, and malicious intentions). The analyses showed that the party vote (Law &amp; Justice, Civic Coalition, Other, No vote) was significantly associated with each of these dependent variables meaning that the voters of different parties differ in their level of support for reforming checks and balances. This is in line with the descriptive patterns of importance assigned to checks and balances presented in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>. In 'no party condition', the voters of the Civic Coalition expressed the lowest support for each of the reforms, while the voters of the Law and Justice expressed the highest support. This finding can be interpreted in two ways: the voters of PiS are the most supportive of such reforms or the 'no party condition' was seen as reflective of the status quo in Poland at the time, namely the government of PiS. Looking at the averages across all three conditions, the voters of PiS are the most supportive of all reforms and assigned least malicious intentions to the reformers (see AO8).</p><p>This result too might point to the fact that the no-party condition has been interpreted in line with the status quo (i.e. that the PiS government was responsible for the reforms) and/or reflect that the PiS voters care less about protecting democratic checks and balances than the voters of Civic Platform. Importantly, in none of the models was the interaction between the condition (no party, in-party, out-party) and party vote significant, showing that the treatment affected all party voters similarly (see AO13).</p><p>Additional analyses with the restricted sample (N = 601) of participants who responded correctly to all checks questions and were not prompted to read the vignettes again show robustness of the experimental results to the sample specifications (see AO15).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion and conclusion</head><p>What do citizens make of proposals to alter democratic rules? Are they vigilant of changing the balance of power and weakening accountability mechanisms? The results of this study offer three main contributions.</p><p>First of all, party cues do affect how citizens evaluate the proposed reforms and how they evaluate the intentions of the reformers. The experiment showed clear evidence of 'my party bias': those participants who receive a cue that a government they support proposes a reform attributed more benign intentions to the reformers than others. By contrast, citizens who received a cue that the reform is proposed by a government they oppose were much more vigilant of such proposals and assigned more malicious authoritarian intentions to the government. This is in line with evidence that the supporters of incumbents might be more willing to trade off democracy for preferred policy and economic benefits <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Graham &amp; Svolik, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Singer, 2018)</ref>. When evaluating the same reform, citizens rely on pre-existing beliefs about the reformer (whom to trust). This evidence aligns with both theories, epistemic vigilance (being weary of who proposes the reform) and motivated reasoning (following the party cues) and contributes to the explanation why in societies with high level of pronounced support for liberal democratic principles, citizens' commitment to democracy seems volatile and contextual.</p><p>Are checks and balances reforms special? First, checks and balances reforms were supported significantly less than the administrative reform. Also the intentions of the reformers were seen as more malicious and less benign when they proposed reforms undermining democratic rules. This aligns with the idea of epistemic vigilance: citizens are more weary of reforms with high stakes.</p><p>However, the party-cues influenced not only reforms of checks and balances, but also the low-stakes administrative reform. So although a rather inconsequential change of a tax statement deadline could be considered a 'consensus issue' <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Slothuus &amp; De Vreese, 2010)</ref>, citizens' evaluations were still affected by who proposes it: when the reform is proposed by 'my party', the intentions behind the reform are perceived as more benign and more support for such reform is expressed. The results</p><p>show that motivated reasoning was active no matter the stakes of the reforms. However, although the evidence for the interaction between party cues and assigned intentions was inconclusive, the difference between in-party and out-party supporters in their approval of the reforms was much smaller in the case of the tax statement deadline than all the checks and balances. Moreover, irrespective of the party issuing the proposal, the administrative reform was not seen as ill-intended, by contrast with the checks and balances reforms. Both these patterns show that epistemic vigilance in a way dampens the effect of motivated reasoning in the case of less relevant reforms and cotriggers partisanship in the case of the reforms changing the balance of power.</p><p>Theoretically, this means that our shared psychology equips us with mechanisms to avoid deception and harm and, as a consequence, be skeptical of the political proposals by an out-group. This leads to a difference in the evaluations of the intentions of the politicians whom we believe have our interest in mind (in-party) vs. those who do not (out-party). It also leads to more vigilance of actions with high stakes. While the theories of epistemic vigilance and motivated reasoning strive to explain the same outcomes, they often do not speak to each other: the former proposes that in-group favoritism is a consequence of (reasonable) vigilance, while the latter frames it more in terms of bias.</p><p>This study showed that when it comes to politics, we likely observe an interplay between them. The next step in integrating epistemic vigilance with motivated reasoning is to theorize a boundary between a healthy dose of skepticism of the out-party (epistemic vigilance) and the blind-following of the in-party line (motivated reasoning). On the flip side, we would benefit from learning what are the limits of motivated reasoning and whether epistemic vigilance can help us find them.</p><p>Future research can address several limitations of this study. Although the experiment uses three different reform scenarios, the results do not necessarily generalize to different checks and balances and different violations that could lead to backsliding. In addition, the results show some variability in the evaluations of different types of reforms and somewhat different levels of intentions assigned to them. For example, participants consistently evaluated the proposed reform of protest registration in most negative terms. It could be that the differences in evaluations of the reforms of checks and balances reflect familiarity with particular reforms (e.g., Polish participants were more likely to be familiar with the debates about the courts reforms). Another potential explanation is that the protest registration change represents a reform with the highest stakes in the eyes of citizens (especially the opposition voters). Future studies could expand the scope of tested reforms to other checks and balances, measure the importance of different types of reforms and their evaluations directly, and further refine the experimental instrument, including the measures of perceived intentions of the reformers. Alternative designs are needed to test the epistemic vigilance activation in the context of politics more directly. In addition, future studies could theorize and test different triggers -beyond party cues and stakes/relevance -of epistemic vigilance in the context of politics.</p><p>Furthermore, the presented study applies an experimental design to be able to detect the causal link between party cues and intentions assigned to the reformers. Despite the strengths of such design, experimental effects do not necessarily directly translate to the effects on attitudes and behavior outside of the experimental setting. In addition, the effects found in the experiment cannot be translated directly to the population, because the used sample is not fully representative. At the same time, if the evaluations of the reforms and the reformers were affected by these rather weak party cues, it is not unreasonable to expect stronger effects among citizens participating in real-life political struggles. Importantly, because of insufficient power, the test of the interaction between party cues and reform type is inconclusive, and the robustness of the found effects would need to be tested with a larger sample.</p><p>Finally, this study used data from Poland to test general theories about party-cues that garnered largest support from research conducted in polarized systems such as the US <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Gidengil et al., 2022)</ref>.</p><p>It expanded evidence that in the systems with multiple parties the party cues can affect citizens' attitudes and their evaluations of institutional reforms. Further studies could test if these effects are present in multiparty systems with different levels of democracy and lower polarization.</p><p>The results imply that democracy can become vulnerable when the ruling majority is not too worried about the dismantling of institutions that hold the political elites accountable, i.e., when the majority turns into passive bystanders <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Saikkonen &amp; Christensen, 2023)</ref>. In the analyzed case of Poland at the time of data collection, the incumbent government represented the voters who were on average more supportive of altering democratic accountability mechanisms (the voters of Law and Justice), which might have contributed even further to the democratic backsliding (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Wunsch et al., 2025)</ref>.</p><p>This study tells us that if a government that has a parliamentary majority starts shifting the political playing field and abusing their power, the majority of citizens who are on the side of this government will be less vigilant of potentially long-term negative effects of such changes. By contrast, the political opponents will be the most vigilant and suspicious of the intentions behind altering checks and balances and therefore more likely to try to prevent the erosion of democratic principles. Importantly, although the supporters of different parties have different levels of approval for reforms undermining checks and balances, the results show that, overall, the majority of citizens are vigilant of changing the balance of power and are not enthusiastic about reforms changing liberal democratic rules.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Variable</head><p>To check for the ecological validity of the presented scenarios, participants answered the question 'Was it difficult to imagine that the reforms described in the scenarios are being considered in Poland?' for each of the reforms (getting rid of the two-term limit for presidency, changing the appointment and dismissal of judges, changing the registration of protests, changing the tax statement deadline) on the scale from 1-"Very difficult" to 7-"Very easy". The results show that on average it was not too difficult for participants to imagine the reforms presented in the scenarios.</p><p>The mean answer to this question for each reform was above the mid-point of the scale. The reform changing the tax statement deadline was the easiest to imagine as being considered in Poland (M = 4.89, SD = 1.79), followed by the registration of protests (M = 4.68, SD = 1.20), the appointment of judges (M = 4.61, SD = 2.04), and the presidential term reform (M = 4.36, SD = 2.07).</p><p>Given the situation in Poland at the time of the study, it could be that it was easier to imagine that a particular party proposes reforms of checks and balances. To check if this was the case, participants were asked 'Is it difficult to imagine that your favorite party in Poland considers a reform changing the rules of the appointment and dismissal of judges?' and answered on the scale from 1-"Very difficult" to 7-"Very easy".

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>AO6. Manipulation/comprehension checks</head><p>After each vignette and with the text of the vignette visible on the screen participants were asked to answer three questions (see below): two checking if the crucial manipulated information was picked up (which party introduces the reform and what type of reform is proposed) and one about information that was not manipulated to at least partially address the potential issue of secondguessing the design of the experiment (which political figure proposed the reform). If a participant answered one of these questions incorrectly, they were prompted with the text again and asked to read again and answer correctly to continue. All participants moved to the dependent variable measures after answering the manipulation check questions for the second time irrespective of their answers.</p><p>a) In the text above, we asked you to imagine a party winning the election. According to the scenario you read, which party won the election? 1-A party you support and feel very close to 2-A party you oppose and do not feel close to at all 3-The Green party 4-The Social Democratic Party 5-The information about which party won was not specified in the text b) In the text above, we asked you to imagine a reform. According to the scenario, which reform was proposed? 1-Reform of the appointment and dismissal of judges 2-Reform of registration of protests 3-Reform of the presidential term limit 4-Reform of the tax statement deadline 5-Reform of the military c) In the text above, we asked you to imagine that someone proposes a reform.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>AO12. Deviations from pre-registration</head><p>The main study was pre-registered (available here: https://osf.io/tc2k8/?view_only=60c0d64fe613482287657149df6e7e33). Due to a low passing rate of the comprehension checks and to a mistake in programming by the survey company the study deviated in two main ways from the pre-registration:</p><p>• Participants were encouraged to read the text of the vignette again and to answer the questions about the text to make sure they are engaging with the presented scenario before they moved to the questions measuring the dependent variables (see AO6 for details) • As the survey company by mistake added an open-ended question after the vignette asking participants to reflect on the scenario (which was not a part of the experimental design). additional data was collected without this question. The hypotheses in the first batch of data (presented in this paper) were only tested after the collection of additional data was completed. There were no obvious ways in which the open question could have affected the participants. On one hand it could have encouraged participants to think about the real situation in Poland and attribute the reforms to particular parties. which would make detecting the effects more difficult. On the other. it could have stimulated participants to think deeper about the presented scenario. The results of the additional data collection are reported in AO13.</p><p>Minor deviations from pre-registration:</p><p>• The numbers of hypotheses were changed. 'signal' was replaced with 'cue' and 'coalition' with 'party'. 'motivation' with 'intention'. and "skeptical about" with "vigilant of" for consistency (See Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">6A</ref>). None of these wording adjustments have substantive consequences for the hypotheses. • The formulation of H3a was adjusted without changing the intention of the hypothesis. The original formulation was underspecified. H3: Citizens respond differently to the reforms altering checks and balances than to administrative (non-political) reforms.</p><p>General expectation: Citizens respond differently to the reforms altering checks and balances than to administrative (non-political) reforms.</p><p>H3a: Citizens are more divided about the motivations behind the reforms of checks and balances than behind the administrative reforms.</p><p>H3: The effect of party-cue is expected to be stronger for the reforms with higher stakes (checks and balances) than reforms with lower stakes (administrative reform)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>AO13. Analysis of differential treatment effects across party voters</head><p>To test for potential differential treatment effects across different party voters. I conducted factorial ANOVAs for each checks and balances reform (appointment of judges. protest registration. and presidential term limit) and for all three dependent variables (support. benign intentions. and malicious intentions). The analyses showed that the party vote (Law &amp; Justice. Civic Coalition. Other. No vote) was significantly associated with each of these dependent variables meaning that the voters of different parties differ in their level of support for reforming checks and balances. In no party condition. the voters of Civic Coalition expressed the lowest support for each of the reforms. while the voters of Law and Justice expressed the highest support. Importantly. in none of the models was the interaction between the condition (no party. inparty. out-party) and party significant. showing that the treatment affected all party voters similarly. As an example. I present the results for the analyses of support for different checks and balances.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Demographics</head><p>The total sample collected in the rerun of the study was N = 350 Polish citizens. The sample was 50 % female. with average age of 44 years old (SD = 15.1) and minimum of 18 and maximum of 69 years old. Around 5 % of participants indicated an education level below upper secondary. 56 % upper secondary. and around 40 % tertiary education.</p><p>In terms of voting behaviour. 27 % of participants indicated that they voted for Law and Justice. 26 % for Civic Coalition. 11 % for the Left. 8 % for Confederation. and 5 % for Polish Coalition. The same as in the main study. 13 % answered that they did not vote in elections.</p><p>These descriptive statistics show that that the two samples (in the main study and in the rerun) are very similar in terms of demographic characteristics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures</head><p>The design of the re-run study was the same as of the main study. Because the sample in the re-run is much smaller than in the main study and. as a consequence. more measurement error is to be expected in the analyses. the answers about the three checks and balances reforms were pulled to create a more reliable dependent variable. Three scales averaging answers to questions about dependent variables across the different reforms:</p><p>-Reform support scale (Cronbach's alpha = .90): appointment of judges reform justified. agree with the reform of appointment of judges. presidential term limit reform justified. agree with the reform of presidential term limit. protest registration reform justified. agree with the reform of protest registration -Benign motivations scale (Cronbach's alpha = .83): reform of courts is to assure independence of judges. reforms of courts is to strengthen democracy. reform of presidential term limit is to assure that the president can check the government in line with the mechanisms of checks and balances of power. reform of presidential term limit is to strengthen democracy. reform of protest registration is to assure that citizens can protest in a safe way. reform of protest registration is to strengthen democracy -Malicious motivations scale (Crobach's alpha = .84): reform of courts is to have fewer limitations on their power. so the government can do whatever it wants. reforms of courts is to undermine democracy. reform of presidential term limit is to is to have fewer limitations on their power. so the government can do whatever it wants. reform of presidential term limit is to undermine democracy. reform of protest registration is to is to have fewer limitations on their power. so the government can do whatever it wants. reform of protest registration is to undermine democracy</p><p>For the tax statement deadline reform. the dependent variables were kept the same as in the main study:</p><p>-Reform support scale (Cronbach's alpha = .92): tax statement deadline reform justified. agree with the tax statement deadline reform -Benign motivations (Cronbach's alpha = .83): tax statement deadline is to make it easier for citizens to file taxes. tax statement deadline reform is to improve the functioning of state administration -Malicious motivations (Cronbach's alpha = .81): tax statement deadline is to make it more difficult for citizens to file taxes. tax statement deadline reform is to worsen the functioning of state administration</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Three ANOVA analyses were conducted to test the effects of party cues on each of the dependent variables related to the checks and balances reforms. and three ANOVA analyses tested the effect of party cues on the dependent variables related to the tax statement deadline reforms. Figures 1A. 2A. and 3A show pairs of graphs with the effects of party cues on support for. attribution of benign motivations. and attribution of malicious motivations to checks and balances reforms and to tax statement deadline reform.</p><p>The results of the ANOVA analysis showed no statistically significant effect of party cues on the support for checks and balances reforms. F (2. 347) = 2.30. p = .10. Given this analysis relies on a much smaller sample. the power to detect this effect was much lower than in the planned main study. Therefore. it is important to investigate the data patterns more closely. The data shows a very similar pattern to the results of the main study. Participants who received an in-party cue supported the reforms of checks and balances more (M = 3.52. SD = 1.45) than participants in no party (M = 3.13. SD = 1.63) and out-party condition (M = 3.10. SD = 1.70). There was no statistically significant effect of party cues on the support for the tax statement deadline reform (F (2. 347) = 0.04. p = .96). Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1A</ref> shows that on average reforms of checks and balances are supported less than tax statement deadline reform and the differences between means across party cues conditions are larger in the case of checks and balances reforms. The results of the ANOVA analysis showed statistically significant effect of party cues on the attribution of benign intentions to the reforms of checks and balances. F (2. 347) = 4.61. p = .01. Participants who received an in-party cue attributed significantly more benign motivations to the reforms of checks and balances (M = 3.77. SD = 1.24) than participants in no party (M = 3.28. SD = 1.55) and out-party condition (M = 3.22. SD = 1.55). There was no statistically significant effect of party cues on the attribution of benign motivations to the tax statement deadline reform (F (2. 347) = 0.99. p = .37). Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2A</ref> also shows that on average the motivations for reforms of checks and balances are considered as less benign than motivations for the reform of tax statement deadline. Also. the differences between means across party-cues conditions are larger in the case of checks and balances reforms. Importantly. we see much higher concentration of low scores indicating low level of benign motivations attributed to the reforms of checks and balances and a much higher concentration of high scores indicating high level of benign motivations attributed to the reform of tax statement deadline. The results of the ANOVA analysis showed statistically significant effect of party cues on the attribution of malicious intentions to the reforms of checks and balances. F (2. 347) = 4.62. p = .01. Participants who received an in-party cue attributed significantly less malicious motivations to the reforms of checks and balances (M = 4.32. SD = 1.36) than participants in no party (M = 4.88. SD = 1.51) and out-party condition (M = 4.80. SD = 1.51). There was no statistically significant effect of party cues on the attribution of malicious motivations to the tax statement deadline reform (F (2. 347) = 0.31. p = .74). Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3A</ref> shows a reversed patterns of data to the patterns for benign motivations. On average the motivations for reforms of checks and balances are considered as more malicious than motivations for the reform of tax statement deadline with more high scores for malicious motivations recorded in the case of checks and balances reforms and more low scores recorded in the case of tax statement deadline.    </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>checks and balances measured with the question 'Please indicate to what extent you agree or disagree with the following statements from 1-'Fully disagree' to 7-'Fully agree''.

			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="5" xml:id="foot_2"><p>The vignette is based on the experimental study in [blinded for review]. The current version of the vignettes about the reform of appointment of judges and the change of the tax statement deadline was pre-tested in a pre-registered pilot study with N = 206 students at [blinded for review] (preregistration available here: https://osf.io/5ydzr/?view_only=1df5871eb60542039a7e59ae4776bc44).</p></note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="6" xml:id="foot_3"><p>The results of a soft launch of the data collection revealed that a large percentage of participants are not reading the vignette text, are unable to answer the comprehension check questions correctly, and therefore the manipulation is not received by a large proportion of participants. Because of this an alternative strategy than the pre-registered one was chosen to increase the attention, comprehension and thus reception of the manipulation. For full discussion of the used strategy, see the appendix AO6.</p></note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="7" xml:id="foot_4"><p>I conducted power analysis for ANOVA Repeated measures using G*power. I converted effect size f to eta squared with the formula η 2 = f 2 /(1 + f 2 ). The study had power = .90 to detect between-subject and withinsubject effects of η 2 = 0.01 or larger. The study had insufficient power to detect interaction effects smaller than η 2 = 0.02.</p></note>

The Greenhouse-Geisser estimate is greater than .75 for all three dependent variables, therefore a less conservative correction can be used (seeField, 2013, p. 548).

If a participant answered one of the three questions incorrectly. they were prompted to read the vignette text carefully again and answer the questions correctly to proceed with the study. Irrespective of the responses at the second try. participants were able to continue the survey. Table <ref type="table">29A</ref> shows the frequencies of the correct and incorrect answers to all there questions across the different party and reform conditions.

Frequencies for answers on the manipulation and comprehension check questions.
