<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Network support remains an underexplored type of social support. We address this gap by exploring how people tell personal stories about challenges in network support processes.</p><p>Specifically, we focus on the "friend problems", in which a romantic relationship is hindered by friends. Mixed-methods analyses of 900 Reddit posts revealed three major themes: challenges in gaining support from a partner's friends, in intermediating between one's partner and friends, and in approving a friend's relationship; significant differences in gender and couple type (i.e., different-sex vs. same-sex) were found. Linguistic and qualitative analysis revealed three narrative roles: the rejected newcomers, torn middlepersons, and judgmental friends. The findings show network support is a contested communicative process of managing exclusion, negotiating power, and sustaining relational legitimacy.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>the group or connection, but a threat <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Jenson et al., 2021)</ref>. This may then lead to a deficit of network support to other agents in this process that wish a successful integration. Given the roadblocks, it is valuable to understand how people make sense of and manage the challenges.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Managing Challenges in Network Support</head><p>People's reactions to and management of challenges in network support have been studied in specific contexts and agents (i.e., newcomers, middle persons, or the target connection). Take the friend problems for example. Research has explored how perceptions of disapprove of one's marriage from the spouse's friends predict the probability of divorce at a later time point through friend interference of marriage (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Fiori et al., 2018)</ref>. Research also examined communication strategies in response to one's own friends' disapproval of one's partner, categorizing them into passive vs. active and direct vs. indirect (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Crowley &amp; Faw, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Sigler &amp; Forest, 2025)</ref>. Works also showed that a third-party friend can struggle to balance between communicating their concern about a relationship and keeping the connection between them and the person in love not being hurt from the warning (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Etcheverry et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Gillian et al., 2022)</ref>. These studies accumulated rich evidence of communication strategies people use to manage challenges in network support-though rarely explicit under such a label. However, so far, these findings are produced in separate contexts and from separate agents' perspectives. Also, it is unclear how these agents tell stories of challenges in network support to make sense of the setbacks. An integrated perspective that compares narrated experiences from all three agents will contribute to the extant literature. In the current paper, we aim to profile experiences of the three agents in coordinating amid challenges of network support for romantic relationships.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A Communicated Narrative Sensemaking Lens</head><p>Failures in network support create precisely the kind of ambiguity that requires sensemaking, the process of turning confusing events into a plausible theory that can guide action <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Weick, 1995)</ref>. The central problem is not merely what happened, but what it means.</p><p>Building on this, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bietti, Tilston, and Bangerter (2019)</ref> argue that storytelling is the specific, adaptive mechanism for collective sensemaking. They further propose that telling stories allows communities to collaboratively manage uncertainty and reinforce social cohesion. This positions the Reddit forums in our study not as collections of individual vents, but as public arenas whether users collaboratively construct narratives to manage relational threats.</p><p>The Communicated Narrative Sensemaking (CNSM) framework provides the specific vocabulary to analyze this process as a communicative phenomenon <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Kellas, 2017)</ref>. The CNSM framework provides the tools to analyze sensemaking through its communicative form: storytelling. To operationalize this, our study focuses on the core components of any narrative: the plots that define the conflict, the characters involved, and the themes or morals that reveal how meaning is made. This framework is not just descriptive; it provides the analytic tools to decode how these stories function. By examining these elements, we can map the distinct ways people interpret and communicate about the failure of network support, moving from a summary of topics to an interpretation of their meaning.</p><p>Online communities are where people collectively negotiate social rules. Research on platforms from Wikipedia to TikTok shows users publicly debating everything from community policy to relational norms, effectively co-authoring social scripts for conduct <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Mendelson, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Nagar, 2012)</ref>. This public negotiation creates a vocabulary for private struggles. Individuals draw on these shared frameworks to make sense of their own lives, a process <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Zhang and Wang (2025)</ref> observed as users managed romantic relationships by taking advantage of collective astrological narratives. The public narrative that deals with what is acceptable provides the raw material for managing one's private crisis.</p><p>Taken together, these studies show that people use online storytelling to make sense of relational problems and manage their identities. CNSM offers an overarching epistemological tool for systematically explicating this process. It allows us to move beyond simply documenting that people talk about the friend problems and instead ask how these narratives are constructed and what they reveal about the challenges of network support.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Current Study</head><p>In the current work, we use the "friend problems" in romantic relationships as a proxy to understand how people make sense of network support. This is because network support is crucial for couples and individuals in a romantic relationship to flourish. As relationship research shows, interference and support from social network members (e.g., friends), potentially solicited through marriage work <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Felmlee, 2001)</ref> and relationship work <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Jensen &amp; Rauer, 2016)</ref>, have important effects on relational and personal well-being <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Afifi et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Brisini &amp; Solomon, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Manning et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Proulx et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Sprecher, 2011)</ref>. It is critical to understand the "friend problems" from the perspectives of the three agents. Additionally, it will be valuable to explore demographic differences in different stories. Furthermore, we explore how people make sense of these friend problems through linguistic traits and specific content of stories from different perspectives. Taken together, we propose three research questions: RQ1: What are common themes and subthemes in "friend problems"? RQ2: Who are more likely to report friend problems of different themes? RQ3: How do the thematic and linguistic features of narratives in each theme reveal the distinct ways people make sense of challenges in "friend problems"?</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Collection and Processing</head><p>We collected posts from four major relationship subreddits, including r/relationship, r/relationship advice, r/dating, r/dating advice, because (1) they are often studied in relationshiprelated support stories (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Entwistle et al., 2021)</ref>, offering relevant support content, and (2) they require post titles to contain age and gender of people involved, offering demographic information. Using the PMAW API and PMAW library, we extracted a total of 1,329,672 Reddit posts from four subreddits generated in the year of 2024: 273,247 from r/relationships, 655,111 from r/relationship_advice, 203,123 from r/dating_advice, and 198,191 from r/dating. To refine our dataset, we applied a keyword-based filtering approach, identifying 1,898 relevant posts. The filtering process required both "friends" and "partners" (or related terms such as "boyfriend," "girlfriend," "bf," or "gf") to appear together in either the post title or selftext. This ensured that the extracted data focused on discussions explicitly involving both friendship and romantic relationships.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Human-AI Collaborative Coding</head><p>Both authors qualitatively explored main relationship types with 100 random posts, and reached an agreement that there three main themes: integrating self into partner's friend network, integrating partner into one's own friend network, and supporting a friend and their partner as a third person; each post fell into one of the themes. This was then verified with another 100 random posts. We then turned to collaborating with state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) at the time, ChatGPT 4o, as recent advancements show that LLMs can be used to expedite content analysis of common social phenomenon under clear prompts <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Peng &amp; Yang, 2025)</ref>. We asked ChatGPT 4o to identify posts in the four relationship subreddits that are relevant to the three themes identified by both authors, and give them corresponding code (1-3, respectively). We arrived at 1583 posts after dropping posts with removed content. Next, we randomly drew 100 posts, summarized nine subthemes under the three major themes, gave each detailed coding criteria, and tried manual coding for another 100 posts. Within 100 posts, thematic saturation was reached, and no new theme emerged. After addressing differences between authors, we prompted ChatGPT with the updated coding scheme to code the 1583 posts into subthemes. The coding scheme was refined based on trial coding by ChatGPT and fed to ChatGPT for final coding (Appendix). 683 posts were further dropped because they were coded as irrelevant or presenting positive interactions-which are beyond the scope of the current study. Two authors separately coded roughly 11% of the remaining 990 posts that were randomly drawn from the total sample (98 posts), addressed differences and unified code, compared human coding results to machine coding results, and found a higher intercoder reliability, indicated by a Krippendorff's alpha of .93.</p><p>In our collaboration with ChatGPT, to ensure structured and reproducible outputs for our content analysis, we configured the model to generate responses in json_object format. We set the temperature to a low value of 0 to produce highly deterministic text, minimizing random variation between runs. The Top P parameter was maintained at 1.00, allowing the model to consider the full probability distribution of tokens during generation.</p><p>Additionally, we used RE in RStudio 2022.07.0 to retrieve age, gender, and couple type (i.e., different-sex vs. same-sex) from the titles of the posts. The mean age was 23.6 years for posters (based on 676 posts), 24.6 years for the partners in question (based on 526 posts), and 24.11 years for the friends in the scenarios (based on 392 posts). As for gender: around 65% of posters were man and the rest were woman (n=436; based on 676 posts) and the rest were woman; around 42% partners in question were woman (n=220) and the rest were man (based on 524 posts); around 58% friends in the scenarios were women (n=228) and the rest were man (based on 392 posts). For couple type, around 76% posts were about different-sex couples (n=294) and the rest were about same-sex couples (based on 386 posts).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Linguistic Marks</head><p>We leveraged the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) package developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Boyd et al. (2022)</ref> to analyze linguistic traits of posts. We selected a few categories to examine for their relevance, including general characteristics (e.g., word count) to understand general patterns, language complexity (e.g., big words) and cognitive process (e.g., cognition) to gauge cognitive characteristics, affective process (e.g., negative tone, sadness) to capture emotional responses, and pronounce use (e.g., I, we) and social and relational processes (e.g., conflict, moral) to understand relational references and interplays in narratives.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Analysis</head><p>We ran multinomial logistic regressions and Chi-square tests to address the research question of demographic differences between different themes (RQ2) and one-way analyses of variance (ANOVAs) using LWIC to answer the research question of linguistic traits associated with distinct themes (RQ3). In the analyses addressing RQ2, demographics were the predictors and likelihood for a post to fall under a certain theme the outcomes. In the analyses addressing R3, post theme was the predictor, and linguistic traits were the outcomes. We only ran analyses for the three main themes but not the subthemes because many of them have sparse cases, which would severely threaten the validity of tests. Given the extensive number of LIWC measures tested in answering RQ3, the p values were adjusted using Benjamini-Hochberg correction to control false discovery rate (FDR; <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Lydersen, 2021)</ref>. Sensitivity tests were conducted with demographics controlled to cross-validate results about RQ3. LIWC related computations were completed in R Studio 2025.05.1+513. Other analyses were completed in SPSS 22.0.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RQ1: Types of "Friend Problems" in Relationships</head><p>The analysis shows that reported friend-related problems most frequently concern a poster's platonic friend and that friend's romantic partner (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). This category accounted for the majority of posts (n = 680, 75.6%). In comparison, problems involving the poster's own romantic partner and that partner's friends were far less common (n = 152, 16.9%). The least frequent type of conflict involved the integration of the poster's partner with the poster's own friends (n= 68, 7.6%). These findings show that individuals are substantially more likely to report issues originating from a friend's romantic relationship than to report issues involving their own partner and their respective social circles.</p><p>Within the situation where poster reported issues between a poster's friend and that friend's romantic partner, the leading issue was the poster's concern for their concern for their friend's well-being due to that friend's partner (n = 277, 30.8%). Following this were direct conflicts between the poster and the friend's partner (n = 203, 22.6%) and disruption to the poster-friend relationship (n = 200, 22.2%). For issues concerning the poster's partner and their friends, the most common complaint was the partner's inadequate handling of the situation (n = 60, 6.7%). Finally, when the conflict was between the poster's own friends and the poster's partner, the problem was most often caused by the partner's negativity towards the friends (n = 36, 4.0%). This was followed by the poster's challenges in managing the relationship between the two sides (n= 19, 2.1%) and the friends' negativity towards the partner (n = 13, 1.4%).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RQ2: Demographic Differences Between Themes</head><p>Multinominal regressions (Table <ref type="table">2</ref>) treating "the problems with a friend's partner" (Code 3) as the reference group showed no significant age differences in posters or the partner involved between the three major types of problems reported. However, the data revealed significant differences related to gender and the type of relationship (Table <ref type="table">2</ref>). The poster's gender (χ²(2) = 6.53, p = .038), the partner's gender (χ²(2) = 10.59, p = .005), and the couple's relationship type (χ²(2) = 7.32, p = .026) all showed a significant association with the kind of friend-related problem reported.</p><p>Planned comparisons with Bonferroni corrections (p &lt; 0.016) showed that women were more likely than men to report problems relevant to being included in their partner's friend network (Code 1) than managing the relationship between their own friends and their partner (Code 2) and vice versa, χ²(1) = 6.43, p = .011. Similarly, posters with man partners (23%) were more likely than posters with a woman partner to report problems with their partner's friends (Code 1) rather than managing the relationship between their own friends and their partner (Code 2), χ²(1) = 10.41, p = .001. Finally, posts about different-sex relationships were significantly more likely than posts about same-sex relationships to report issues with their partner's friends (Code 1) rather than judging a friend's partner or romantic relationship (Code 3), χ²(1) = 6.35, p = .012.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RQ3: How Do People Make Sense of Friend Problems in Romantic Relationships?</head><p>Our analysis of the narratives identified three distinctive linguistic profiles: the rejected newcomers, the torn middle person, and the judgmental friends. Each profile suggests a unique authorial perspective and psychological state. We compared the linguistic features of these groups using a series of one-way ANOVAs. Because Levene's test indicated that variances were unequal across groups for many linguistic markers, we applied Welch's robust F-test for all comparisons. Where a significant overall difference was found, we conducted post-hoc tests with a Bonferroni correction to identify which specific groups differed. The full results of these analyses are detailed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">3</ref>, followed by summary of demographic and linguistic characteristics for three profiles in Table <ref type="table">4</ref>. Sensitivity tests controlling demographics (e.g., age, gender) showed that the results in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">3</ref> were robust.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Rejected Newcomers: Shifting Blame Away from Self</head><p>The rejected newcomers wrote posts using a tongue of personal testimony and justification. Their posts contained more words (M = 630.13, SD = 346.19) than those of friends who judged romantic relationships (M = 473.68, SD = 325.13; p &lt; .001) and were characterized by a strong focus on personal experience, evident in a higher frequency of I-words (M = 8.52, SD = 1.97) than in the posts of judgmental friends (M = 7.67, SD = 3.01; p = .002). This justificatory stance was further reinforced by the highest rate of Discrepancy words (M = 2.05, SD = 0.77) among all three roles, suggesting efforts to outline perceived injustices in detail.</p><p>For rejected newcomers, storytelling served as a critical tool for sensemaking, enabling them to justify intense feelings of exclusion and relational threat. The narrative often functions to frame a partner's friend as a direct antagonist. For example, one author (P1; 18, female) explicitly concluded, "He's (partner friend) ruining my relationship and my trust." However, the blame doesn't stop with the friend; it often extends to the romantic partner for failing to act. For instance, another author (P2; 20, female) felt she and her boyfriend were being collectively "walked all over by his roommate," illustrating how the justification for anger can stem less from a friend's initial hostility and more from the partner's subsequent failure to defend the relational dyad.</p><p>In positioning themselves as outsiders, these narrators were highly attuned to the risk of negative social labels. This identity-work was evident in preemptive justifications, such as one author's (P1; 18, woman) plea, "I dont wanna seem toxic," which immediately followed an outburst of anger. This conflict also manifested as strategic inaction, as another narrator (P3; 28, woman) feared that setting a boundary would simply "validate all the things they've been saying about me." Both narratives thus reveal a sophisticated negotiation with social norms that can pathologize such protective relational impulses.</p><p>Ultimately, this sensemaking process often shifted the locus of blame from the friend to the partner, enabling a re-evaluation of the relationship itself. This sensemaking process shifted the locus of blame toward the partner, prompting a re-evaluation of the relationship itself. The narratives functioned as a normative appeal, testing the partner against an implicit script of loyalty, which one author (P4; 28, woman) articulated as wanting "someone who will be in my corner." When this script was violated, the partner's failure became the central injury, powerfully captured in another's (P5; 29, woman) conclusion: "now I feel like every time he's with B, he's choosing him over me." The initial "friend problem" is thereby reinterpreted as a fundamental failure of the partnership, a critical turning point in the narrator's assessment of the relationship's viability.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Torn Middle Persons: Balancing Critique and Empathy</head><p>In stark contrast, the torn middle persons painted a picture of internal turmoil, uniquely defined by the combination of the highest Authenticity (M = 66.51, SD = 22.12) and the lowest Clout (i.e., confidence; M = 41.10, SD = 19.05). This internal focus was further reflected in the language, which, despite being of the highest word count (M = 648.76, SD = 479.34), contained the fewest references to others, both through the lowest other-focused She/He pronouns (M = 5.47, SD = 2.09) and general Social Words (M = 20.04, SD = 3.21).</p><p>Interestingly, authors appeared to grapple with their anxiety through cognitive complexity, employing the most Big Words (M = 14.54, SD = 3.02) among all three roles.</p><p>Narratives by the torn middle persons reveal a pattern of internal conflict, as participants grapple with competing desires and obligations. Rather than portraying a linear or decisive path, many accounts involve careful weighing of options and emotional ambivalence. In one post, the author (P6; 28, woman) shares, "I want to be there for her wedding but at the same time, I need to respect my partner because I feel super disrespected." In another post, the poster (P7; 26, man) said, "She said that it's either I'm friends with him and we break up, or her and I stay together and I drop him." Both highlight the emotional strain of balancing long-standing loyalty to a friend with commitment to a romantic partner.</p><p>At the heart of this struggle lies a self that feels constrained. The disruption of personal rhythms, for example, "missed many Saturday morning hikes... because she wants to spend the whole weekend at my place on a 3 day bender" (P8; 33, woman), illustrates how external forces limit autonomy. Middle persons' uncertainty, such as "I think he may be right but idk if it's some sort of manipulation tactic or if he's legit worried and concerned about me" (P9; 21, woman), reveals a hesitant self, unsure how to navigate the blurred lines between care and control.</p><p>Across these narratives, many narrators manage internal conflict and constrained agency by balancing critique with empathy. For example, one narrator acknowledged his friend's flaws while also valuing their long-term loyalty. For example, one poster (P7; 26, man) commented about his friend, saying "He says blatantly offensive things like racist and misogynistic comments… but he is… charismatic and intelligent". Another narrator (P8; 33, woman) reflected on doubt about her boyfriend's intentions, saying, "I think he may be right but idk if it's some sort of manipulation tactic or if he's legit worried and concerned about me." This balancing act allows torn middle persons to navigate feelings of powerlessness by holding multiple, sometimes contradictory perspectives, reflecting the complex emotional work involved in maintaining relationships amid tension.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Judgmental Friends: Self-Distancing</head><p>Finally, the posts from judgmental friends reflect social observation and judgment.</p><p>Reinforcing this detached stance, these narratives were the most common (&gt;70%) yet also the shortest, showing the lowest levels of both Authenticity (M = 48.81, SD = 20.68) and Self-Focus (M = 7.67, p &lt; .001). Instead of personal narrative, their focus was external and authoritative. They wrote with the highest level of Clout (M = 52.99, SD = 26.36) and a strong focus on others (She/He pronouns: M = 6.89, SD = 3.15). The friend authors' goal of seeking moral judgments was evident in their significantly higher rates of Moral Words (M = 0.42, SD = 0.51) than the posts of middle persons (M = 0.27, SD = 0.25).</p><p>Qualitatively, the stories of judgmental friends highlight significant challenges in network integration, particularly the presence of a central figure who acts as a social disruptor. These narratives are characterized by a mounting sense of frustration and moral indignation as the author recounts a series of perceived slights or inappropriate behaviors from an "other." The primary challenge articulated is the inability to resolve conflict and maintain harmony within the broader friendship circle, often because the problematic individual is the partner of a close friend or family member. For example, one user (P10; 32, man) describes the escalating conflict with his wife's friend's boyfriend, Ted, who makes a series of inappropriate comments, including, "your mother is exactly how I imagined her, a divorced woman who acts like a man." This creates a strained dynamic where the author feels disrespected and unheard by both the friend and their partner, leading to a sense of social isolation within the triad.</p><p>The way judgmental friends manage this tension is linguistically evident in their detached and moralistic storytelling. The narratives are characterized by low Authenticity and Self-Focus, indicating that the authors are not grappling with internal doubt or emotional conflict, but rather presenting a finished case. Instead of internalizing the problem, they manage their frustration by externalizing the conflict and framing the "other" as a moral transgressor. This is underscored by the highest use of Other-Focus pronouns and Moral Words in their stories. This linguistic pattern suggests that they see themselves as a moral authority or "gatekeeper" and their inability to enforce a social boundary is the primary source of their frustration. Their high use of Question Marks, as seen in the final lines of the user post ("Am I not worth defending? Do my feelings not matter?"; P10; 32, man), serves not as a search for personal understanding, but as a rhetorical appeal to the community, inviting others to validate their judgment and affirm the moral rightness of their position.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>This study challenges the conventional view of network support as a straightforward act of social inclusion. Instead, our findings compel a reconceptualization of network support as a dynamic and often contested communicative process of relational negotiation. By analyzing narratives from the newcomer, the middle person, and the target of integration, we reveal that network support is not merely a resource to be given, but also a form of legitimacy to be won.</p><p>The stories people tell about these dynamics show that this process is defined less by the simple act of inclusion and more by the communicative work of managing exclusion, negotiating legitimacy, and sustaining power imbalances across relational roles.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Friends On the Side Do More Sensemaking Work Than People in Love</head><p>Stories in our dataset most often came from friends who felt threatened or excluded from a peer's romantic relationship, rather than from those in the romantic dyad themselves. This asymmetry suggests that friendships are often at a structural disadvantage in network support: they occupy the "lower hand" and therefore must do more communicative sensemaking work to preserve their legitimacy. These dynamics reflect cultural norms of marital primacy or singlism <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(DePaulo &amp; Morris, 2005)</ref>, which privilege romantic relationships over friendships. Such privileging is counterproductive for network support, as it frames integration as replacement and makes inclusion feel threatening. Health research suggests that the loss or weakening of friendships can increase loneliness, stress, and depressive symptoms <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Hu, 2025;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Hu et al., 2025)</ref>, highlighting the significance of this imbalance for well-being.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Friendships and romantic relationships as competing ties</head><p>The data also reveal that friendships and romantic relationships could function as competing rather than complementary ties. Though friends have been conceptualized as a potential resource of support for romantic relationships <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Felmlee, 2001)</ref>, they can also compete with romantic partners for attention, investment, and care from the middle persons. The privileging of romantic ties over friendships <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(DePaulo &amp; Morris, 2005)</ref> pressures individuals to constantly negotiate which relationships to prioritize, further straining integration efforts.</p><p>Though the legitimacy of prioritizing partners over friends is challenged by recent research (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Hu, 2025)</ref>, our finding shows that such practice and mindset remain present in society and can impede the healthy functioning of the romantic relationship itself.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RQ2: Demographic Differences in Themes</head><p>Patterns in demographic differences indicate that these tensions are not isolated to one group but cut across social categories. First, problems appear universal across age groups, suggesting that network support challenges are a recurring feature of relational life. Second, women more often described difficulty being accepted into a partner's friend group, while men more often reported strain in intermediating between partners and friends. Third, same-sex relationships were more likely to be judged on legitimacy compared to different-sex relationships, underscoring cultural scripts that scrutinize queer partnerships more harshly.</p><p>Together, these demographic patterns suggest that network support dynamics are socially patterned, shaped by intersecting norms of gender, sexuality, and cultural legitimacy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RQ3: Communicated Narrative Sensemaking in Themes</head><p>Applying a communicated narrative sensemaking lens (CNSM; <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Kellas, 2017)</ref>, we find that narratives function not just as accounts of difficulty but as interpretive strategies that assign value, responsibility, and legitimacy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Rejected Newcomers</head><p>These individuals tell stories as outsiders, portraying themselves as needing to justify their value and exonerate themselves from blame. Their stories often question the legitimacy of the relationship itself, suggesting a mechanism by which friends gatekeep romantic ties-by making a partner doubt whether their relationship is valid. This dynamic reflects communicative strategies of justification and sensegiving. Such boundary-negotiating communication strategies are consequential to one's romantic relationships. Research <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Fiori et al., 2018)</ref> has shown that husbands' perception of wives' friends' disapproval of their relationships was predictive of divorce in the future. Our study further specified the communicative process that bridges perceiving one's partner's friends' disapproval and dissolving the romantic relationship among rejected newcomers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Torn Middle Persons</head><p>Positioned structurally as brokers, these individuals narrate feelings of powerlessness and stress. Rather than leveraging their brokerage role for authority, they balance critique and empathy to manage tensions less hostily than rejected partners. These stories highlight the emotional labor of brokerage and point to constructive-but taxing-communication strategies for sustaining relational harmony. Our finding cross-validates findings from <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Crowley and Faw's (2014)</ref> research that examined how individuals advocate for their romantic partner and marshal support from their friends. Mapping out various reactions to friends' disapproval of one's own romantic relationship by direction (approach vs. avoidance) and directedness (direct vs. indirect), Crowley and Faw identified most strategies under the approach-indirect quadrant: for example, highlighting positives, increasing relationship talk (i.e., conversations about one's relationship), and asking other people to encourage the opposed friend to be more supportive. These strategies show torn middle persons may try to maintain harmony between their partner and their own friends with less confrontational, constructive communication strategies. On top of that, we reveal the psychological burden of doing such middle person work-posts from middle persons highlight the psychological burnout in intermediating conflicting relationships. Sometimes, it is plausible that burnout leads to dissolution of the friendship <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Gillian et al., 2022)</ref> and/or the romantic relationship <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Jenson et al., 2021)</ref>. The communicative ramification of such fatigue warrants more future investigations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Judgmental Friends</head><p>The most common role, these narrators distance themselves rhetorically while simultaneously presenting themselves as moral authorities. In real life, people often turn to their friends to complain about problems in their romantic relationships <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Julien et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Lind Seal et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Vallade et al., 2016)</ref>. In response, friends in the current study appear "cold" and objective, which can be interpreted in at least two ways. One, friends' may be more clear-minded judges about a romantic relationship as an outsider to the love affair-most of the time presumably. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Etcheverry et al. (2013)</ref> showed that friends often use perceived satisfaction and quality of alternatives as benchmarks for judging whether a romantic relationship of their friends' is worth of pursuing, but not perceived investment. It seems that friends care more about whether one is happy in one love affair (and maybe one can be happier in another romantic relationship), but not so much the sunken cost-the ignorance of sunken cost is often considered rational for important decisions in real life. Two, however, the distanced stance may also reflect friends' thinking that they are not qualified to be too involved in and interfere a romantic relationship.</p><p>Such narratives reveal how friends may internalize cultural norms that privilege romantic ties <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(DePaulo, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">DePaulo &amp; Morris, 2005)</ref>, thereby treating themselves as secondary by default. This role may explain how the formation of romantic ties reduces investment in friendships, reproducing cultural hierarchies <ref type="bibr">(DePaulo, 2014, pp. 71-72)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theoretical Implications</head><p>Network support has been briefly conceptualized as structural acts of inclusion <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Cutrona &amp; Russell, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Cutrona &amp; Suhr, 1992)</ref>, but not quite systematically explored as a communication process. We refine the conceptualization to specify network support as a coordinated, negotiated communication process between different roles in the three-party relationships, including newcomers, middle persons, and judgmental friends. We further show how agents in different roles employ distinct communication strategies to manage setbacks in the support process. The insights extend social support theory in the communication literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Cutrona &amp; Russell, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Cutrona &amp; Suhr, 1992)</ref> by emphasizing that support is not only structural (who is included) but also communicative (how legitimacy and belonging are negotiated). Integrating CNSM <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Kellas, 2017)</ref>, our findings show that storytelling itself is a form of relational work through which people justify, negotiate, and assign meaning to support failures. Briefly summed up, our integrated comparisons showed that rejected newcomers withdraw and question their relationship, torn middle persons try to coordinate, and judgmental friends stand afar and offer reflective advice-all three forming a coordinated dynamics of network support as a communication process that is worth more future investigation and theorizing. More broadly, the results highlight how cultural norms of marital primacy shape network support, underscoring that social support processes are deeply embedded in cultural scripts and relational power dynamics. Future research may consider incorporating broader socio-cultural models in theorizing network support.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Practical Implications</head><p>These findings offer several practical takeaways for improving relational health and wellbeing. First, because friendships often bear the communicative burden in integration challenges, Third, the finding that same-sex couples face more legitimacy judgments points to the importance of promoting inclusive support practices, particularly among friend groups and families. Developing messages that normalize queer relationships in social support contexts may reduce exclusion and stress. Finally, our results suggest that health practitioners and counselors should view network support as a communicative process, not only a structural one. Helping clients reframe negative narratives-whether as rejected newcomers, torn brokers, or judgmental friends-may promote healthier integration and reduce the stress associated with exclusionary dynamics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations and Future Directions</head><p>This study is limited in several ways. First, the data are cross-sectional and drawn from Reddit, which prevents causal inferences and may bias the narratives shared. Second, sparse cases limited our ability to fully probe all subthemes, reducing nuance in some areas. Future research should move beyond descriptive data to test how messages designed to facilitate network support are produced and interpreted across different roles. Experimental approaches could examine the effects of communicative strategies such as justification, empathy-balancing, and moral appeals on integration outcomes. By identifying effective message strategies, research can advance theory and inform interventions to improve network support processes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>This study highlights that network support is not only a structural resource but also a contested, coordinated communicative process shaped by narratives of newcomers, middle persons, and friends. These stories reveal the asymmetry of friendships and romantic ties, the communicative labor required to sustain legitimacy, and the cultural norms that prioritize some relationships over others. By situating these findings within communication and social support theories, we demonstrate that network support involves not only fostering inclusion but also managing exclusion, negotiating power, and sustaining relational legitimacy.  worries about the dynamic itself. The problem originates with the complexity of managing this interface.</p></div>
