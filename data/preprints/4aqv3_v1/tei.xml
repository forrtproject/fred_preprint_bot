<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Over the past decade, public opinion on transgender issues in the US has shifted from growing support toward increasing polarization, driven by a series of increasingly contentious cultural, legal, and political debates. While a majority of the public favors nondiscrimination laws in employment and housing for transgender individuals, unease has risen over policies such as gender-affirming care for minors and transgender sports participation <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Gallup 2024</ref><ref type="bibr">, Pew Research Center 2025</ref><ref type="bibr">, PRRI 2025)</ref>. This shift in public opinion aligns with recent legal battles, such as the 2020 Supreme Court ruling in Bostock v.</p><p>Clayton County, which extended federal workplace protections to transgender employees, contrasted by the 2025 United States v. Skrmetti decision upholding Tennessee's ban on gender-affirming care for minors. Republican-led initiatives -including Trump administration policies limiting transgender military service, and 122 anti-trans state bills passed in 2025 so far <ref type="bibr">(Tracker 2025)</ref> -have also intensified.</p><p>The evolving landscape of public opinion and legal restrictions on transgender rights has set the stage for anti-trans attitudes to emerge as a salient mobilizing factor in contemporary US elections, potentially outpacing the influence of attitudes towards lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) individuals. As public acceptance of LGB rights has grown <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Flores 2014)</ref>, opposition to transgender-specific policies -such as gender-affirming care for minors and transgender sports participation -has become a focal point for Republican political mobilization, resonating with voters concerned about cultural change <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Castle 2019</ref>). 1 This divergence is evident in political messaging and rhetoric <ref type="bibr">(Congressional Equality Caucus 2025</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">, Campbell-Fox et al. 2024</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">, Turnbull-Dugarte &amp; McMillan 2023)</ref>, where GOP elites increasingly emphasize anti-trans policies, leveraging growing pub-1 Though I posit that anti-LGB attitudes have diminished as a predictor of Republican vote choice due to the growing normalization of LGB identities, pockets of resistance to pro-LGB policies likely persist -particularly among groups where anti-LGB sentiment still holds electoral salience. Still, my argument is that the broader cultural and legal mainstreaming of LGB identities -evidenced by landmark rulings such as Obergefell v. <ref type="bibr">Hodges (2015)</ref> and widespread media representation -suggests that anti-LGB attitudes are becoming less potent as a mobilizing force compared to the emotionally charged and less socially constrained opposition to trans rights. lic unease towards some pro-transgender policies observed in public opinion surveys <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Gallup 2024</ref><ref type="bibr">, Pew Research Center 2025</ref><ref type="bibr">, PRRI 2025)</ref>. Unlike anti-LGB attitudes, which may have waned as an electoral driver of Republican support due to greater cultural, legal, and social normalization, anti-trans sentiment offers a fresh wedge issue, thereby amplifying partisan polarization and shaping Republican voter preferences in ways that may redefine the electoral salience of identity politics.</p><p>In this paper, I argue that anti-trans attitudes emerged as a stronger predictor of Republican vote choice in 2024 than anti-LGB attitudes. I posit that anti-trans attitudes are not only distinct in their electoral impact but also reflect a broader realignment of social conservative priorities within the Republican base. While opposition to LGB rights has historically unified Republican voters <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Daniels 2019)</ref>, the increasing normalization of</p><p>LGB identities may have diminished their salience as a mobilizing force, whereas antitrans sentiment has gained traction as a potent wedge issue. I hypothesize that antitrans attitudes are more strongly associated with Republican electoral mobilization due to their ongoing alignment with anxieties about cultural change and perceived threats to traditional norms.<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">2</ref> My paper therefore tests whether anti-trans attitudes, as opposed to anti-LGB attitudes, more significantly shaped voter preferences in the 2024 election.</p><p>Empirically, I draw on data from the 2024 ANES. Across my models of presidential vote choice, I find that affective orientations toward transgender individuals and opposition to transgender-inclusive policies are significantly and consistently associated with support for Trump in 2024 -more so than analogous measures of affect and policy opposition toward LGB individuals. This pattern of results suggests that transgender issues may have overtaken LGB issues as an important cultural cleavage shaping electoral behavior in 2024. Importantly, anti-trans effects are rivalled by sociotropic evaluations and racial resentment, suggesting that, while transgender issues are emerging as a potent cultural wedge, they operate alongside other key drivers of vote choice. Together, these findings provide evidence that the politicization of transgender rights may have crystallized into a new and electorally consequential dimension of partisan conflict in the US.</p><p>My paper advances current understanding of US political behavior in three ways.</p><p>First, it suggests that anti-trans attitudes may have surpassed anti-LGB attitudes as a predictor of Republican vote choice, signalling a shift in the hierarchy of cultural issues driving polarization <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Egan 2020)</ref>. Second, it contributes to research on identity politics by illustrating how anxieties surrounding gender identity have been strategically leveraged as wedge issues to mobilize voters <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Fetner 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">, McAdam &amp; Kloos 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">, Brewer 2003)</ref>. In doing so, it builds on scholarship demonstrating how moralized identity threats, particularly those tied to gender and sexuality, structure affective polarization and partisan sorting <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Mason 2018</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">, Huddy et al. 2015)</ref>. Finally, it extends the literature on cultural backlash by highlighting how Republican elites have reoriented their electoral strategy around the defense of "traditional" gender norms, transforming trans rights into a symbolic battleground over cultural authority and moral order <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Gidron &amp; Hall 2020</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">, Inglehart &amp; Norris 2016</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">, Mutz 2018)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Evolving Public Opinion and Elite Leadership on Transgender Issues</head><p>By the mid-2010s, public opinion began shifting toward greater acceptance of some transgender rights, driven by increased visibility and elite-driven policy advocacy. For instance, public opinion surveys illustrated strong support for nondiscrimination protections in areas such as employment and housing <ref type="bibr">(Marist Poll 2016)</ref>. Elite leadership played in important part in this evolution, with the Obama administration advancing transgenderinclusive policies such as the 2016 guidance allowing transgender students to use facilities matching their gender identities (US Department of Justice and US Department of Edu-cation 2016).<ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">3</ref> In addition, media portrayals, including high-profile cases such as Caitlyn Jenner, further normalized transgender identities among the wider public <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Miller et al. 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Since 2020, public opinion on transgender rights has entered a phase of polarization, with elite leadership amplifying divisions to mobilize voters. While overall support for nondiscrimination protections remains high among the wider public, specific policies such as gender-affirming care for minors and transgender sports participation have become political flashpoints <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Gallup 2024</ref><ref type="bibr">, Pew Research Center 2025</ref><ref type="bibr">, PRRI 2025)</ref>. Republican elites have strategically escalated anti-trans rhetoric around these issues, leveraging moral panic frameworks to portray transgender rights as a threat to children, families, and societal norms <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Pepin-Neff &amp; Cohen 2021)</ref>. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">4</ref> This approach draws on historical tactics used in culture wars, where emotionally-charged issues are leveraged to galvanize conservative voters <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Fetner 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">, Layman 2001)</ref>. For instance, notable campaigns in states such as Florida and Texas have centered on legislation restricting gender-affirming care for minors, such as Florida's 2022 "Don't Say Gay" bill and Texas's SB 14 in 2023, which bans such care for those under 18 (Tracker 2025). These policies are often accompanied by rhetoric portraying transgender individuals as undermining traditional gender roles or endangering youth, a tactic that resonates with socially conservative voters and may drive turnout <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Ayoub &amp; Page 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Conversely, Democratic elites have doubled down on inclusion for transgender individuals, emphasizing civil rights and healthcare access, though their messaging often struggles to counter the emotional resonance of Republican narratives. For instance, the Democratic Party's 2024 platform explicitly committed to expanding access to gender-affirming care, including federal health plan coverage for hormone therapy and surgery, while reversing Trump-era discriminatory policies in the military and healthcare <ref type="bibr">(TransLash 2024</ref>). Yet post-2024 election analyses highlight messaging pitfalls. Harris largely sidestepped Republican anti-trans ads, leading to internal party debates over whether to frame transgender rights as a core civil rights issue or adapt to voter unease, with strategists noting that Democratic responses often come across as dismissive rather than empathetic to public concerns about fairness in sports or youth healthcare <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Nagourney &amp; Nehamas 2024)</ref>.</p><p>This has fuelled perceptions of Democrats as prioritizing "inclusivity" over relatable family issues, amplifying the emotional pull of Republican framing around child protection and "biological truth" (Sapir 2024). The sum of this polarization has been to elevate antitrans attitudes as a key electoral wedge issue, particularly among Republican voters.</p><p>Although public opinion on transgender rights has polarized sharply since 2020, it is important to recognize that, in terms of issue salience, transgender rights have historically occupied a relatively low position among the American public's priorities. As aforenoted, public opinion surveys consistently demonstrate that most Americans support nondiscrimination protections (PRRI 2024). However, only a small fraction view transgender rights as an urgent national issue, and many believe political elites devote too much attention to it <ref type="bibr">(Pew Research Center 2022</ref><ref type="bibr">, 2025</ref><ref type="bibr">, The 19th 2025</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">, YouGov 2025)</ref>.</p><p>Nonetheless, Republican elites and media outlets have elevated the symbolic visibility of transgender issues far beyond their objective salience <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Flores et al. 2018)</ref>. Through selective amplification of emotionally charged topics -for instance youth healthcare, school sports, and restroom access -political and media elites have reframed a once-marginal social issue into a defining partisan identity marker <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Lewis et al. 2024</ref>). This tension between low public salience and high symbolic salience is crucial to understanding how elite cueing and moral panic have transformed transgender rights into a central partisan boundary by 2024 (Bishin et al. 2020). 5  Three theoretical mechanisms shed light on the evolution of public opinion and elite leadership towards transgender issues. First, issue evolution theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Carmines &amp; Stimson 1989</ref>) accounts for how low-salience issues become enduring partisan divides once political elites consistently attach partisan cues to them. As elites and activists strategically emphasize certain policy stances, voters internalize these cues, reshaping party coalitions around the issue. In the case of transgender rights, elite messaging has reframed questions of gender identity, medical care, and public access as defining ideological boundaries, transforming attitudes toward transgender people into a reliable indicator of partisan identity <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Jones &amp; Brewer 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Second, agenda-setting theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(McCombs &amp; Shaw 1972)</ref> highlights how media and political elites influence which transgender-related topics gain public visibility and political traction. Media attention has concentrated heavily on emotionally charged issues -such as youth gender-affirming healthcare, school sports participation, and restroom accesswhile comparatively neglecting less contentious areas like employment or housing protections <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Billard 2019)</ref>. This selective amplification shapes not only public salience but also the interpretive frames through which citizens engage these issues, often invoking moral or protective narratives that heighten perceived urgency and conflict <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Westbrook &amp; Schilt 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Finally, moral panic theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Cohen 2011)</ref> explains the rapid escalation of anti-trans sentiment through processes in which elites and media actors construct transgender rights as a symbolic threat to social order. Fear-based framing-particularly around children, family values, and public safety-mobilizes voters and justifies restrictive policies, creating a cycle of heightened anxiety and legislative response <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Amery &amp; Mondon 2025)</ref>.</p><p>Contemporary evidence indicates that these dynamics are intensified by partisan media ecosystems and social media amplification, which spread misinformation and reinforce to partisan framing, their reactions in turn incentivize further elite emphasis on the issue. This iterative process complicates causal attribution, underscoring that mass polarization on transgender issues is both a product and a driver of elite polarization.</p><p>echo chambers of moral outrage <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Farris &amp; Silber Mohamed 2018)</ref>. Taken together, these mechanisms reveal a feedback loop in which elite cueing, media salience, and moral panic interact to solidify partisan divisions and sustain the politicization of transgender rights over time.</p><p>In sum, the co-evolution of public opinion and elite leadership on trans issues has potentially significant implications for US electoral politics. As LGB rights gain broader acceptance, anti-trans attitudes have become a more potent mobilizing force, particularly for Republicans seeking to energize their base. The strategic focus on transgender issues as a wedge reflects a broader realignment in social conservative priorities, where cultural anxieties about gender identity increasingly overshadow older debates about sexuality. This shift underscores the power of elite cues in shaping public opinion <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Zaller 1992</ref>) and highlights the challenges for advocates of transgender rights in countering emotionally charged narratives. By 2024, the salience of anti-trans attitudes in Republican vote choice signals a new phase in the politics of identity, where transgender rights serve as a battleground for competing visions of American society.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Anti Trans Issues in the 2024 Election</head><p>The partisan polarization surrounding transgender rights that intensified through the late 2010s and early 2020s reached full electoral expression in the 2024 campaign. The mechanisms outlined in the previous section -namely, elite cueing, selective media salience, and moral panic -have transformed transgender rights from a relatively low-salience social concern into a defining partisan boundary. As elite rhetoric and media framing link transgender visibility to broader narratives about parental rights, fairness, and moral decline, attitudes toward transgender people have become powerful signals of partisan alignment. The 2024 election therefore represents a culmination of this process, as Republican elites explicitly mobilized anti-trans sentiment as a core element of their culture-war agenda.</p><p>By 2024, the Republican Party largely moved beyond opposition to LGB rights, which had lost mobilizing potential following the mainstreaming of same-sex marriage and increasing public acceptance of LGB individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Egan 2020</ref><ref type="bibr">, Rauch 2024)</ref>. In place of these diminishing wedge issues, party elites reframed transgender rights as emblematic of progressive overreach -connecting them to anxieties about education, healthcare, and gender norms. This strategic shift positioned transgender inclusion as a moral and social threat, reinforcing conservative voters' perceptions of defending tradition and family values against liberal cultural imposition <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Castle 2019</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">, Kay &amp; Dimakis 2024)</ref>. State-level policy campaigns reflected this reframing. Legislation restricting bathroom access, banning gender-affirming care for minors, and excluding transgender athletes from sports were widely promoted as efforts to "protect children" and "defend women's spaces" <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Jones 2025)</ref>. Such policies extended beyond their immediate scope -they served as symbolic resistance to perceived elite moral decay. This alignment of policy, rhetoric, and identity made opposition to transgender rights an efficient vehicle for partisan mobilization.</p><p>If elite polarization and issue evolution have indeed recast transgender rights as a central partisan divide, then attitudes toward transgender individuals and related policies should now exert stronger influence on Republican vote choice than attitudes toward</p><p>LGB individuals. While discomfort or prejudice toward LGB people persists, explicit opposition has become socially costly and less electorally effective <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Egan 2020)</ref>. Contrastingly, anti-trans attitudes remain more publicly acceptable within conservative discourse, particularly when framed in moral or protective terms <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Flores et al. 2021)</ref>. This suggests that affective and cognitive evaluations of transgender individuals -for instance, discomfort, perceived threat, or disapproval -should now be more tightly coupled to Republican identification and vote choice than analogous evaluations of LGB people.</p><p>H1a: Estimations of transgender individuals are more strongly associated with vote choice for Trump than estimations of LGB individuals.</p><p>Similarly, opposition to transgender-inclusive policies should be a stronger predictor of Republican support than opposition to LGB rights. While same-sex marriage and employment nondiscrimination have become settled issues for much of the electorate, policies surrounding gender-affirming care, restroom access, and sports participation remain active flashpoints. These policy stances function as ideological signals within the broader "parental rights" and "biological truth" narratives that dominate Republican cultural messaging <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Campbell-Fox et al. 2024</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">, Turnbull-Dugarte &amp; McMillan 2023)</ref>. Consistent with partisan sorting theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Mason 2018)</ref>, I expect that individuals who oppose transgenderinclusive policies are more likely to align with the Republican Party in 2024.</p><p>H1b: Opposition to transgender rights is more strongly associated with vote choice for Trump than opposition to LGB rights.</p><p>To test the relative influence of anti-trans attitudes in the 2024 election, it is useful to compare their effects against established predictors of vote choice, such as voters' sociotropic and egotropic economic evaluations, as well as candidate specific factors, such as racial resentment and modern sexism. This comparison is important because it contextualizes the role of an emerging cultural wedge issue such as transgender rights within the broader landscape of electoral determinants, revealing whether anti-trans sentiment represents a potent new axis of polarization, or remains secondary to longstanding factors such as economic performance and identity-based prejudices.</p><p>Economic evaluations have long been robust predictors of vote choice in U.S. presidential elections, with sociotropic assessments often exerting a stronger influence than egotropic ones, as voters tend to reward or punish incumbents based on national economic conditions rather than purely personal finances <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Lewis-Beck &amp; Stegmaier 2000</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">, Kinder &amp; Kiewiet 1981)</ref>. For Trump specifically, racial resentment -reflecting symbolic attitudes toward racial equality and perceived grievances -has been a key driver of support <ref type="bibr">(Schaffner et al. 2018</ref><ref type="bibr">, Sides et al. 2019)</ref>. Similarly, modern sexism, which captures ambivalent or subtle biases against women's roles in society, has predicted opposition to female candidates and is correlated with Republican vote choice <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Deckman &amp; Cassese 2021</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">, McThomas &amp; Tesler 2016</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">, Knuckey 2019)</ref>. Crucially, both racial resentment and modern sexism may be particularly relevant in contests involving women such as Harris, whose identity as a woman of color intersects with both sexist and racial resentments to heighten their relevance <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Knuckey &amp; Mathews 2024)</ref>. However, while anti-trans attitudes have gained symbolic salience through elite-driven moral panics, their overall public priority remains low compared to economic concerns, with surveys indicating that transgender issues rank among the least important to voters' decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Gallup 2024)</ref>. This suggests that, despite their mobilizing potential for conservative base turnout, the magnitude of anti-trans effects on vote choice may be comparable to that of racial resentment and modern sexism -serving as identity-reinforcing signals in a polarized electorate -but likely smaller than sociotropic economic evaluations, which consistently dominate as a retrospective accountability mechanisms and were likely to be particularly salient given voters' poor perceptions of the economy under Biden (Pew Research Center 2024).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H2:</head><p>The magnitude of the effect of anti-trans attitudes on vote choice for Trump is comparable to that of racial resentment and modern sexism but smaller than that of sociotropic economic evaluations.</p><p>Taken together, my hypotheses translate the macro-level processes of elite polarization and moral panic into micro-level expectations about voter behavior in 2024. The politicization of transgender rights -shaped by elite cueing, selective media salience, and populist moral framing -suggests that anti-trans attitudes now serve as a central axis of parti-san differentiation in American politics. The 2024 election thus provides a useful context to evaluate how far this new frontier of the culture wars has restructured the relationship between identity, morality, and vote choice. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data and Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dependent Measure</head><p>Presential vote choice is operationalized with an item that asks respondents which candidate they voted for in the November election for President. Possible options were 1 = "Kamala Harris," 2 = "Donald Trump," 4 = "Cornel West," 5 = "Jill Stein," or 6 = "Another candidate." To simplify my analysis, I model two-party vote choice (1 = "Donald Trump," 0 = "Kamala Harris"). Excluding minor candidates, such as third-party or independent options, reduces noise in the data and aligns with the practical reality that such candidates rarely influence electoral outcomes significantly.<ref type="foot" target="#foot_5">7</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Affect Towards Transgender and LGB Individuals</head><p>To measure group-based affect, I include two 101-point feeling thermometers that tap into respondents' feelings toward transgender individuals, as well as gays and lesbians.</p><p>A rating of 100 is indicative of "very warm or favorable feelings," while a rating of 0 is indicative of "very cool or unfavorable feelings."</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Opposition to Transgender and LGB Rights</head><p>The 2024 ANES contains three items that tap into public opinion on transgender rights.</p><p>The first item is a 7-point ordinal measure that asks whether respondents support or oppose transgender people using the bathroom that matches their gender identity, with possible responses ranging between 1 = "favor a great deal," to 7 = "oppose a great deal."</p><p>The second item is a 7-point ordinal measure that asks whether respondents favor or oppose banning transgender girls from K-12 girls sports, with possible responses ranging between 1 = "favor a great deal," to 7 = "oppose a great deal." The third item is a 7-point ordinal item that asks respondents whether they favor or oppose transgender people serving in the military, with possible responses ranging between 1 = "favor a great deal," to 7 = "oppose a great deal." The second item is reverse coded so that higher values indicate greater opposition to trans rights. I then sum the three items and average them into a composite index opposition to transgender rights (Cronbach's α = .77).</p><p>For public opinion on LGB rights, the 2024 ANES contains two items. The first item is a 6-point ordinal item asking respondents how strongly they feel about whether or not gay/lesbian couples should be allowed to adopt children, with possible responses ranging between 1 = "feels very strongly gay/lesbian couples should be permitted to adopt," to 6 = "feels very strongly gay/lesbian couples should not be permitted to adopt."</p><p>The second item is a 7-point ordinal item asking respondents whether favor or oppose the right of gay and lesbian couples to marry legally, with possible options ranging between 1 = "favor a great deal," to 7 = "oppose a great deal." Because the two items are measured on different scales, I z-transform both items to ensure that each contributes equally to the composite score.<ref type="foot" target="#foot_6">8</ref> After transformation, I sum and average the two items into a composite index of opposition to LGB rights (Cronbach's α = .85).<ref type="foot" target="#foot_7">9</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Covariates</head><p>Models also include several covariates. For voters' sociotropic and egotropic evaluations, I include two items. For sociotropic evaluations, I include a 5-point ordinal item that asks respondents whether they think the national economy has gotten better or worse in the past year, with possible responses ranging between 1 = "much better," to 5 = "much worse." For egotropic evaluations, I include a 5-point ordinal item that asks respondents how much better or worse off they are financially compared to a year ago, with possible responses ranging between 1 = "much better off," to 5 = "much worse off." Models also include measures of racial resentment and hostile sexism. The racial resentment scale is composed of four items. The first item asks respondents whether they think Blacks should work their way up without any special favors. The second item asks respondents whether they think past slavery and discrimination has made it difficult for Blacks. The third item asks respondents whether they think Blacks have gotten less than they deserve. The fourth item asks respondents whether they think if Blacks tried harder, they would be as well off as whites. All four items are 5-point ordinal measures, with possible responses ranging between 1 = "strongly agree," to 5 = "strongly disagree." Items one and four are reversed coded so that higher values indicate greater resentment. After recoding, the items are summed and then averaged into a composite index of racial resentment (Cronbach's α = .91).</p><p>The modern sexism scale is composed of two items. The first item asks respondents whether they think women demanding equality seek special favors. The second item asks respondents whether they think women complaining about discrimination cause more problems. Both items are 5-point ordinal items ranging between 1 = "always," to 5 = "never." Both items are reverse coded so that higher values indicate higher levels of sexism. After recoding, the items are summed and averaged into a composite index of modern sexism (Cronbach's α = .81) Lastly, I include sociopolitical, demographic, and structural covariates. Models control for party ID (7-point ordinal item ranging between 1 = "strong Democrat," to 7 = "strong Republican"), ideology (7-point ordinal item ranging between 1 = "extremely liberal," to 7 = "extremely conservative"), race (1 = "white, non-Hispanic," 0 = "other race" ), age (in years), gender (1 = "female," 0 = "male"), education (5-point ordinal item ranging between 1 = "less than high school graduate," to 5 = "graduate degree"), family income (28-point ordinal item ranging between 1 = "less than $5,000," to 28 = "$250,000 or more"), frequency of religious service attendance (5-point ordinal item ranging between 1 = "never," to 5 = "every week"), and region (1 = "South," 0 = "non-South").  a respondent who gives transgender individuals a score of 0 on the thermometer (i.e., "very cool or unfavorable feelings") has a .48 predicted probability of voting for Trump.</p></div>

Therefore, moving from the lowest to highest values on the transgender feeling thermometer is associated with a 9-point decrease in the predicted probability of voting for Trump in 2024 (contrast p = &lt;.001). Turning the right panel in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref>, a respondent who gives gays and lesbians a score of 0 on the thermometer has a .42 predicted probability of voting for Trump.

The significant decrease in the likelihood of voting for Trump as feelings toward transgender individuals become more favorable suggests that estimations of transgender individuals were a substantive factor in shaping support for Trump. This effect is both statistically robust and practically meaningful, pointing to transgender-related attitudes as a potential wedge issue that could mobilize support for Trump. Conversely, estimations of gays and lesbians exhibit a minimal and non-significant impact on Trump support, suggesting that this group's salience in driving vote choice is somewhat limited.</p><p>Next, H1b posited that opposition to transgender rights will be more strongly associated with vote choice for Trump than opposition to LGB rights.

Specifically, the statistically significant increase in the predicted probability of having voted for Trump as opposition to transgender rights intensifies suggests such views were a salient predictor of electoral behavior in 2024. Contrastingly, opposition to LGB rights shows a negligible and non-significant impact on vote choice for Trump, indicating that attitudes toward</p><p>LGB rights were less consequential in driving vote choice in 2024.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Putting The Magnitude of Anti-Trans Attitudes in Context</head><p>The results from the previous section demonstrate that anti-transgender attitudes, including negative estimations of transgender individuals and opposition to transgender rights, are more strongly associated with voting for Trump in 2024 than anti-LGB attitudes. However, it is also useful to assess the predictive power of anti-transgender attitudes relative to other factors that likely influenced vote choice in 2024 (H2). To this end, I generate additional predicted probabilities for several of my covariates -namely voters' sociotropic and egotropic evaluations, levels of racial resentment, and levels of modern sexism. The logic of these additional estimations is threefold. Turning to voters' sociotropic evaluations, a respondent who thought that the national economy was "much better" compared to a year before has a .31 predicted probability of voting for Trump. Conversely, a respondent who thought that the national economy was "much worse" compared to a year ago has a .50 predicted probability of voting for Trump.</p><p>Therefore, moving from better to worse evaluations of the national economy is associated with a 19-point increase in the predicted probability of having voted for Trump (contrast p = &lt;.001). Elsewhere, moving from the best to the worst evaluations of a respondent's personal financial situation is associated with an 8-point increase in the predicted probability of voting for Trump (contrast p = &lt;.001), moving from the least to the most resentful on the racial resentment scale is associated with a 17-point increase in the predicted probability of voting for Trump (contrast p = &lt;.001), while moving from the least to the most sexist on the modern sexism scale is associated with a 6-point increase in the predicted probability of voting for Trump (contrast p = &lt;.05). Of the four covariates, sociotropic economic evaluations demonstrate a substantially larger effect size, with a shift from positive to negative evaluations producing a significantly greater increase in the likelihood of voting for Trump relative to the transgender thermometer. Likewise, racial resentment also exhibits a strong effect, with a shift from least to most resentful yielding a larger increase in Trump support than the transgender thermometer. Conversely, egotropic economic evaluations and modern sexism have smaller effect sizes relative to the transgender thermometer, with shifts in these attitudes resulting in more modest increases in the probability of voting for Trump. Overall, then, while affect towards transgender individuals is a substantive predictor of vote choice for Trump, sociotropic economic evaluations and racial resentment exhibit stronger relative effects, with modern sexism and egotropic evaluations playing comparatively lesser roles in driving Trump support.</p><p>Next, I compare relative effect sizes in the vote choice model with the index of opposition to transgender rights. These results are presented below in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">4</ref>. Here, the baseline comparison is the 15-point increase in the predicted probability of voting for Trump as one moves from being the least to the most opposed to transgender rights (contrast p = &lt;.001). Beginning with voters' sociotropic evaluations, moving from the best to the worst evaluations of the national economy is associated with a 17-point increase in the predicted probability of voting for Trump (contrast p = &lt;.001). Meanwhile, moving from the best to the worst evaluations of a respondent's personal financial situation is associated with a 7-point increase in the predicted probability of voting for Trump (contrast p = &lt;.001), while moving from being the least to the most resentful on the racial resentment scale is associated with a 12-point increase in the predicted probability of voting for Trump (p = &lt;.001). Lastly, moving from the least to the most sexist on the modern sexism scale is associated with a 4-point increase in the predicted probability of voting for Trump (contrast n/s).</p><p>Comparing the relative effect sizes of other covariates, sociotropic economic evaluations yield a slightly larger increase in Trump support, suggesting that economic concerns about the nation's performance were a marginally stronger driver of vote choice than opposition to transgender rights. Racial resentment also has a significant but somewhat smaller effect compared to opposition to transgender rights, indicating that atti- tudes toward race were influential but less dominant than economic perceptions or antitransgender sentiment. Meanwhile, egotropic economic evaluations exhibit a notably smaller effect size, implying that individual economic concerns were less predictive of Trump support. Finally, modern sexism has the smallest and least statistically significant effect, suggesting that gender-based attitudes played a minimal role relative to other factors. Overall, then, opposition to transgender rights appears to be a strong predictor of Trump support, closely rivalled by sociotropic economic evaluations, with racial resentment moderately influential, while personal economic concerns and sexism contribute less substantially to explaining vote choice.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Are Anti-LGB Attitudes Really No Longer Predictive?</head><p>To further assess my finding that anti-LGB attitudes are relatively weak predictors of vote choice for Trump in 2024, I conduct a series of further analyses to probe the stability of this result across alternate model specifications, variable constructions, and population subgroups. These tests address potential concerns -namely, model misspecification, measurement artifacts, and heterogeneity in voter attitudes -which might otherwise mask or distort the influence of anti-LGB attitudes on vote choice. Thus, I evaluate whether the diminished electoral salience of anti-LGB attitudes reflects a genuine shift in voter priorities -consistent with the broader normalization of LGB rights -or if this finding is sensitive to methodological choices.</p><p>In my first test, I estimate separate models for anti-LGB and anti-trans attitudes, including both feeling thermometers and policy opposition composites. This approach addresses potential multicollinearity, as anti-LGB and anti-trans attitudes are moderately correlated. 10 Therefore, I estimate models i) trans thermometer only, ii) LGB thermometer only, iii) trans policy opposition only, and iv) LGB policy opposition only. By isolating each attitude, I am able to assess their independent predictive power and compare their significance and effect sizes. This strategy ensures that any non-significant effect of anti-LGB attitudes is not an artifact of collinearity with anti-trans attitudes, providing a clearer test of whether anti-LGB attitudes retains electoral relevance or has indeed been overshadowed by anti-trans sentiment in 2024. Overall, the separate models yield results consistent with the main findings, confirming that anti-LGB attitudes -both affect and 10 While this study posits that anti-trans attitudes have surpassed anti-LGB attitudes as a driver of Republican vote choice, it is possible that these attitudes coexist or interact, potentially sharing moral foundations such as traditionalism or intersecting with other identity-based prejudices <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Flores et al. 2021)</ref>. Recent public opinion also suggest some backsliding in LGB acceptance among certain groups post-2020, particularly among conservative voters, which could amplify anti-trans sentiment through overlapping cultural anxieties <ref type="bibr">(Gallup 2025)</ref>.</p><p>policy opposition -remain relatively weak predictors of vote choice. Across models, the predicted probability changes for anti-LGB measures are minimal (&lt; 4 points, contrast p &gt; 0.05), whereas anti-trans measures produce substantial increases (9-16 points, contrast p &lt; 0.001), reinforcing the diminished electoral salience of anti-LGB sentiment. 11</p><p>Second, I test whether the weak predictivity of the LGB policy opposition composite stems from its measurement or scaling, given its construction from two items with ztransformation to account for their differing scales. To this end, I conduct three analyses.</p><p>First, I estimate separate models using each LGB policy item individuals to assess if specific policies retain predictive power. Second, I reconstruct the LGB opposition composite without z-transformation, rescaling both items to a common 1-7 range via interpolation to ensure consistent measurement. This approach tests whether the null effect of anti-LGB attitudes is robust to alternative specifications of the composite, ensuring that the diminished electoral salience of anti-LGB sentiment is not an artifact of measurement choices, such as the z-transformation or aggregation of distinct policy items. Third, I construct two-item combinations of the transgender policy opposition measure and re-estimate the vote choice models to address potential measurement asymmetries between the transgender and LGB opposition composites. The logic of this test is to equalize the number of items across both measures, mitigating concerns that the stronger anti-trans effect is an artifact of measurement scale length. In the first test, the predicted probability changes for the same-sex marriage item (2-points, contrast n/s) and the adoption item (1-point, contrast n/s) are minimal and insignificant. 12 In the second test, the predicted probability changes in vote choice using the interpolated LGB policy opposition composite are practically the same as those using the z-transformed composite (2-points, contrast n/s). 13 .</p><p>In the third test, the predicted probability chanfges in vote choice using two-item iterations of the anti-transgender policy composite range between 7-11 points (all contrasts p 11 Full model outputs are presented in section C.1 of the Supplemental Information. 12 Full model outputs are presented in section C.2 of the Supplemental Information 13 Full model outputs are presented in section C.3 of the Supplemental Information = &lt;.001). Meanwhile, the predicted probability changes in vote choice for the anti-LGB policy composite remain small and statistically insignificant. 14   Lastly, I evaluate whether the weak predictive effect of anti-LGB attitudes persists across key voter groups, potentially masked by heterogeneity in the full sample. Therefore, I incorporate interaction terms between partisanship, ideology, and anti-LGB attitudes. Specifically, I add interactions between party ID and the anti-LGB measures, as well as between ideology and the anti-LGB measures, to test if these attitudes are more predictive among Republicans or conservatives, where cultural issues like opposition to</p><p>LGB rights are more salient. This approach tests whether the diminished electoral salience of anti-LGB attitudes holds across partisan and ideological spectrums, or if their influence is stronger among Republicans or conservatives. This ensures my findings are not masked by aggregate analysis and accounting for the slower normalization of LGB rights in these groups. Among Republicans, I find that moving from 0 to 100 on the gay and lesbian thermometer changes the predicted probability of voting for Trump by 5 points (contrast n/s), and moving from lowest to highest on the LGB opposition composite changes it by 0.2 points (contrast n/s). Similarly, among conservatives, the changes are 1 point (contrast n/s) and 2 points (contrast n/s), respectively. These findings confirm that anti-LGB attitudes remain non-significant predictors of vote choice even among Republicans and conservatives. 15   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Robustness Tests</head><p>To evaluate the robustness of my finding that anti-trans attitudes are more strongly associated with vote choice than anti-LGB attitudes, I estimate additional models using alternate dependent variables, including vote choice in House and Senate races and feeling thermometers for Donald Trump, J.D. Vance, the Republican Party, and the MAGA 14 Full model outputs are presented in section C.4 of the Supplemental Information. 15 Full model outputs are presented in section C.5 of the Supplemental Information movement. Results consistently demonstrate that anti-trans attitudes-both affective and policy-based -yielded larger and statistically significant effects (8-12-point increases in Republican House/Senate vote probability, p = &lt; .001; 10-15-point increases in thermometer scores, p = &lt; .001) compared to anti-LGB attitudes, which remained weak and nonsignificant (e.g., &lt; 3-point changes, p = &gt; .05). These findings confirm that the electoral salience of anti-trans attitudes extends beyond presidential vote choice to Congressional races and affect toward Republican-associated figures and institutions/movements. 16   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>The findings from my paper provide evidence that anti-trans attitudes served as a more significant predictor of Republican vote choice in the 2024 presidential election than anti-</p><p>LGB attitudes, supporting both H1a and H1b. Specifically, negative affective orientations toward transgender individuals and opposition to transgender-inclusive policies were associated with a significant increase in the predicted probability of voting for Trump in 2024. Conversely, analogous measures for LGB individuals exhibit negligible and nonsignificant effects, with changes in predicted probabilities hovering near zero. These results hold even when controlling for a robust set of covariates, including economic evaluations, racial resentment, modern sexism, and sociopolitical, demographic, and structural factors. Notably, the magnitude of anti-trans effects rivals that of established predictors such as sociotropic economic perceptions and racial resentment, underscoring their substantive role in shaping electoral outcomes. This pattern of results aligns closely with the theoretical models outlined earlier, particularly issue evolution theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Carmines &amp; Stimson 1989)</ref>, which posits that once elites attach consistent partisan cues to an issue, it may reshape voter alignments and become a durable cleavage.

Separate models isolating trans and LGB measures rule out multicollinearity as an explanation for the null LGB effects, while alternative constructions of the LGB policy opposition composite yield similarly weak results. Subgroup analyses, including interactions with partisanship and ideology, also confirm that anti-LGB attitudes remain non-predictive even among Republicans and conservatives -groups where cultural conservatism might be expected to amplify such sentiments.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations and Future Directions</head><p>Despite these contributions, my paper has some limitations that warrant further explorations. "First, the cross-sectional nature of the ANES data precludes definitive causal inference. Although my models demonstrate robust associations, they cannot disentangle whether anti-trans attitudes caused support for Trump or whether partisan cues and elite rhetoric amplified such attitudes among Republican-leaning voters. Future research employing panel data, experimental designs, or media exposure measures could better trace this reciprocal process of attitude formation and reinforcement. In addition, extending to state-level contexts could reveal how transgender politicization varies, informing strategies to bridge partisan divides.</p></div>

The 2024 ANES is a nationally-representative, random probabilitybased mixed mode study composed of face-to-face, web video, phone, and paper-andpencil interviews (N = 5,221) (ANES 2025).

To test whether estimations of transgender individuals are more strongly associated with vote choice for Trump, I estimate the effect of each thermometer on the probability of voting for Trump and compare their relative magnitudes. I do this by specifying a linear probability model (LPM) that estimates vote choice for Trump as a function of both thermometers, as well as my set of covariates. For each thermometer, I then generate predicted probabilities of voting for Trump across the full range of each measure (i.e., from 0 to 100 on each thermometer). I quantify the strength of association as the difference in the predicted probability of voting for Trump between the lowest and highest values of each thermometer, representing the total change in support attributable to variation in that thermometer rating. To compare the relative influence of estimations of transgender individuals and gays and lesbians, I evaluate which thermometer produces the largest difference in the predicted probability of voting for Trump. This approach captures the practical significance of each thermometer in driving vote choice in 2024. The results are presented below in Figure 1.

			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="2" xml:id="foot_0"><p>Importantly, while my paper focuses on associations between attitudes and vote choice, I treats these links as reciprocal and mutually reinforcing rather than strictly causal. That is, anti-trans attitudes may both shape and be shaped by partisan identification and elite messaging, reflecting feedback effects between mass opinion and party strategies.</p></note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="3" xml:id="foot_1"><p>Still, early indications of polarization emerged from state-level efforts such as South Carolina's 2016 "bathroom bill" (H.B. 3018), which sought to restrict transgender individuals' access to restrooms based on their sex assigned at birth, highlighting tensions with federal transgenderinclusive</p></note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="4" xml:id="foot_2"><p>policies.4  While moral panic theory<ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Cohen 2011)</ref> effectively explains the role of elite-driven anti-trans rhetoric in amplifying public unease, it is important not to understate top-down manipulation and grassroots anxieties, such as those stemming from parents' concerns about youth healthcare or religious communities' defence of traditional gender norms<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Amery &amp; Mondon 2025)</ref>.</p></note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="5" xml:id="foot_3"><p>These mechanisms should not be understood as purely top-down processes. Public attitudes toward transgender rights likely interact with elite strategies in a feedback loop: as voters respond</p></note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="6" xml:id="foot_4"><p>Because the 2024 ANES data are cross-sectional, my models identify associational rather than causal relationships. While I cannot determine the temporal ordering between attitudes and vote choice with certainty, I interpret these results within a theoretical framework of reciprocal influence-where both elite cueing and prior partisan alignment shape the development of antitrans attitudes, which in turn reinforce electoral behavior</p></note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="7" xml:id="foot_5"><p>To assess the robustness of the two-party vote choice model, I estimate a series of additional models that include independent and third-party candidates in the reference category alongside Kamala Harris; however, the results are substantively similar to those obtained from the original dichotomized models. These additional models are presented in section A of the Supplemental Information.</p></note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="8" xml:id="foot_6"><p>By converting each item to a standard normal distribution (mean = 0, standard deviation = 1), z-transformation eliminates biases that could arise from differing ranges or variances. This allows for a more accurate and balanced representation of the underlying construct in the composite anti-LGB measure.</p></note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="9" xml:id="foot_7"><p>To test whether these indices are tapping into distinct constructs, I perform two tests. First, a bivariate analysis between the two indices yields a moderate positive correlation between the two indices (r = .55, p = &lt;.001) suggesting that, while opposition to transgender rights and LGB rights share come commonality, their distinctives is supported since the correlation is not excessively high. This aligns with my expectation that the indices reflect related-but-separate opposition. Second, I perform confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to test my theoretically proposed structure that opposition to trans rights (measured by opposition to bathrooms, K-12 sports, serving in the military) and opposition to LGB rights (measured by opposition to adoption, opposition to same-sex marriage) represent separate latent constructs, and to compare this model against a single-factor alternative to confirm their distinctiveness. Overall, the CFA results strongly support my expectation that opposition to transgender rights and opposition to LGB rights are distinct constructs, with the two-factor model (CFI = 0.974, TLI = 0.934, SRMR = 0.032) fitting significantly better than the one-factor model (χ2 diff =</p></note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" xml:id="foot_8"><p>1006.3, p = &lt;.001), evidenced by strong factor loadings and a moderate latent factor correlation (0.690).</p></note>
