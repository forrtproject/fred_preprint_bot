<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The coronavirus-related school closures in Bavaria, as in Germany as a whole, lasted from March to June 2020 and were therefore on an average scale internationally. This study investigates the impact of these closures on reading fluency in elementary students. To evaluate the short-term (one month) and long-term (one year) effects of third-grade school closures on reading fluency, we use a longitudinal causal effects approach. The study involved 9,083 students in Bavaria, divided into two cohorts: one affected by third-grade closures, and a control cohort who experienced closures in second grade one year earlier. Data were collected over five measurement points, using the Salzburger Lesescreening (SLS) to assess reading fluency. The study employed a Difference-in-Differences approach with propensity score weighting to estimate causal effects, accounting for confounders like participation in a reading intervention, gender, educational background, and migration status. Pre-COVID data and pre-trend analysis on the study sample indicated a linear increase in SLS raw scores over time. The affected cohort showed no significant deviations from this trend during the pandemic, suggesting neither short-term nor long-term impacts on reading fluency. However, variations in teaching efforts and other COVID-related effects could have influenced these results. In conclusion, findings indicate that school closures due to COVID-19 have not impacted reading fluency as one example of a consolidated ability, in third grade students in Southern Germany.</p></div>

This study strives to fulfill these requirements and employs the Rubin causal model <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(Rubin, 2005)</ref> to assess the causal influence of school closures on reading fluency in elementary students.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p>To provide a broad overview of the pandemic's effects on student learning, we summarize findings from national and international research starting with meta-analyses and reviews that involve different domains and grades and ending with a more specific look at reading, especially reading fluency in elementary schools.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Global Overview of COVID-related Learning Losses</head><p>Assuming a broad perspective, the overall picture on learning losses after COVID-related school closures reveals significant and substantive learning losses across various countries and domains. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Hammerstein et al. (2021)</ref> reviewed studies across eight countries and found that most reported negative effects of COVID-19-related school closures on student achievement, with a SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM EFFECTS OF THE COVID-19 SCHOOL CLOSURES 4 median effect size of approximately -0.10 standard deviations (SD) for mathematics and reading.</p><p>Another meta-analysis by König and Frey, 2022 also found a robust negative average effect of -0.175 SD, indicating even larger significant learning losses across various subjects including reading, mathematics, and the social sciences. An extensive review by <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Betthäuser et al., 2023</ref> across 15 countries reported an average negative effect of -0.14 SD. Similar effects were found by multiple other authors, such as <ref type="bibr">Zierer, 2021 (-0.11</ref> to -0.17 SD), <ref type="bibr">Engzell et al., 2021 (-0</ref>.08 to -0.14 SD), Di Pietro, 2023 (-0.17 SD), <ref type="bibr">Storey and Zhang, 2021 (-0.15 SD)</ref>, and Donnelly and Patrinos, 2022 (-0.05 to -0.29 SD). However, effect sizes varied substantially between countries.</p><p>Additionally, the duration of school closures varied significantly between countries, making it challenging to accurately compare the true influence of school closures on learning losses across different contexts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Country-specific Variations</head><p>In some countries, schools were closed for as few as eight weeks (e.g., Australia), while others experienced closures extending beyond 34 weeks (e.g., Brazil, India) (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">Zalewska et al., 2023</ref>, for an overview of the duration of school closures in Europe). Consequently, a more detailed country-specific analysis is necessary when assessing the effects of school closures. The difference in school closure durations directly influenced effective learning time. Several reviews and meta-analyses have indicated that effective learning time in distance learning environments was significantly reduced compared to regular school lessons <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Crosson &amp; Silverman, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Lockl et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Pilonieta et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Schult et al., 2022b)</ref>, and it is widely accepted that less effective learning time is associated with slower learning progress <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Everaert et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p>The impact of school closure duration on learning loss is reflected in comparative studies such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Kennedy and Strietholt (2023)</ref> and international comparisons. For instance, American, Italian, and Brazilian schools were closed for periods ranging from 4.5 to 10 months (UNESCO, 2022), and studies from these countries consistently report substantial learning losses <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Alves et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Contini et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr">Kuhfeld, Soland, &amp; Lewis, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr">Kuhfeld, Soland, Lewis, et al., 2022)</ref>. In contrast, schools in Australia were closed for only eight weeks, and schools in Sweden SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM EFFECTS OF THE COVID-19 SCHOOL CLOSURES 5 were mostly not closed at all. Reported learning losses in these countries were very low or absent <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Gore et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Hallin et al., 2022)</ref>.</p><p>Moreover, different countries adopted varied strategies to cope with school closures.</p><p>Generally, European countries seem to have managed the school closures better than non-European countries, as indicated by generally lower learning losses (compare e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Ardington et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Birkelund &amp; Karlson, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Depping et al., 2021)</ref>. Similarly, Australia, where distance learning had been more established compared to Europe, reported no significant impact on reading performance and mathematics among primary school students <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Gore et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>Therefore, considering both the geographic region and the duration of school closures is essential when interpreting the effects of school closures on learning losses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Demographics-related Variations</head><p>Next to the origin of the study, also the background of the studied population played into the effects of school closures on learning losses. Independent of the geographic origin of the studies, socio-economic status (SES), socio-cultural capital, gender, and sometimes race moderated influences of the school closures on learning losses. As one example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Domingue et al., 2022</ref> observed slower growth in reading fluency in US-districts with a higher proportion of Black students in grades one and two. Under the assumption that race, SES, and educational support by parents were confounded in the samples studied, these findings align with those from <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bao et al. (2020)</ref>, which suggest that daily reading aloud at home could mitigate about 42 percent of the potential loss in reading fluency. For the Netherlands, <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Oostdam et al., 2024</ref> showed that the effects of the SES at the individual level were attenuated by negative SES effects at the school level, with only small differences in achievement scores between cohorts. In line with this, the impact of school closures on reading comprehension varied significantly with SES. Students from higher-SES backgrounds generally fared significantly better than those from lower-SES backgrounds <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Depping et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Engzell et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Hammerstein et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr">Kuhfeld, Soland, &amp; Lewis, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Segers et al., 2023)</ref>. Also in Germany, learning losses in reading comprehension were weakly associated with the students' socio-cultural capital <ref type="bibr">(Schult et al</ref>  <ref type="bibr">Ludewig et al.,</ref> 2022 found significant negative differential effects for gender (higher losses for female students), migration background, socio-economic status, and need for special education. Finally, in South Africa, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Ardington et al., 2021</ref> found that learning loss was between 57 to 81 percent of a school year, with girls being disproportionately negatively affected in word reading compared to boys.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Domain-specific Variations</head><p>Apart from geographic and demographic influences, learning is manifold and different domains revealed differential effects. Most studies either tackled learning losses in mathematics and/or reading ability. The general picture seems to be that learning losses were slightly more pronounced in mathematics compared to reading. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Donnelly and Patrinos (2022)</ref> reviewed studies across seven countries and revealed negative effects for reading, ranging from -0.06 to -0.10 SD, while those for mathematics were slightly stronger on average, ranging from -0.05 to -0.19 SD. In line with this, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Betthäuser et al. (2023)</ref> showed in a review of 42 studies across 15 countries that the average learning loss was more pronounced in mathematics (-0.18 SD) than in reading (-0.09 SD). Higher losses in reading compared to mathematics are in accordance with findings from further original studies, such as <ref type="bibr">Borgonovi and Ferrara, 2023 (Italy)</ref>, <ref type="bibr">Engzell et al., 2021 (Netherlands)</ref>, <ref type="bibr">Tomasik et al., 2021 (Switzerland)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Haelermans et al., 2022, and</ref><ref type="bibr">Oostdam et al., 2024 (both Netherlands)</ref>. In contrast, a review by <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Hammerstein et al., 2021</ref> with 11 studies across eight countries found almost identical effects for reading (-0.09 SD) and mathematics (-0.10 SD). All in all, effects on reading seemed to be more stable compared to mathematics <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Haelermans et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Oostdam et al., 2024)</ref>. This was also supported by findings from <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Miller et al., 2023</ref><ref type="bibr">as well as Depping et al., 2021</ref> who even reported positive effects for mathematics. One possible reason for higher effect stability of reading could be the homogeneity of the construct. While mathematics is composed of various sub-disciplines such as calculus, geometry, analysis, or probability theory, reading is a more uniform construct.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM EFFECTS OF THE COVID-19 SCHOOL CLOSURES 7</head><p>Short-term vs. Long-term Effects Moreover, the temporal distance to the school closures influenced the measurable learning loss. In the short-term, learning losses were in general evident and quantifiable. Studies across various contexts consistently found that students experienced setbacks in their academic progress, immediately after school closures. On average, these short-term learning losses accounted to approximately -0.1 standard deviations. However, the situation appeared less severe when researchers investigated long-term effects. <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Skar et al., 2023</ref> provided evidence of a positive trend in Norway for the domain of writing. Their research suggested that over time, the negative impacts of school closures diminished, and in some cases, students showed signs of recovery or even improvement. Several other studies noted a rebound in academic achievement as well. <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Oostdam et al. (2024)</ref> found that the negative impact on reading skills observed during the first lockdown was substantially mitigated by positive recovery effects following the second lockdown in the Netherlands. <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Schult et al., 2022b</ref> corroborated these results for Germany, indicating that the pattern of initial decline followed by recovery was observed in other contexts as well.</p><p>However, the overall picture remains complex and requires further exploration. Variations in recovery patterns across different countries and contexts suggest that multiple factors, including the duration and quality of remote learning, access to resources, and socio-economic disparities, play critical roles in shaping the long-term effects of school closures <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Halloran et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Learning, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Schult et al., 2022b)</ref>. This complexity is reflected in the diverse outcomes reported in various studies, underscoring the need for continued research to comprehensively understand the full extent and nature of the impact of school closures on learning losses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mitigation of Variations</head><p>So far, we have established that the geographic origin of the population studied, their socio-demographic characteristics, the domain studied, and the temporal distance to the closures moderate the impact that school closures had on learning losses. In order to confine the effects of school closures as much as possible and to obtain high internal validity, these influences need to be mitigated. This can be achieved on various levels, such as restricting the study design or SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM EFFECTS OF THE COVID-19 SCHOOL CLOSURES 8 through statistical control for possible confounders. In the following we will present our study and show how we approached the mitigation of the possible confounding influences discussed above.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Current Study</head><p>Our current study was part of the larger project XXX. This project comprised two cohorts of elementary school students between grades two and four (first cohort) and between grades three and four (second cohort). Of these students, one sub-sample participated in systematic reading interventions while the other sub-sample had regular reading lessons. The reading interventions were teacher-led and designed to train reading fluency during the second grade, reading comprehension in third grade, and meta-cognitive competencies in the context of reading comprehension in fourth grade. Reading progress was monitored in terms of reading fluency, reading comprehension, and orthography (see, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Birkel, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr">Kraus et al., accepted;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">Wimmer &amp; Mayringer, 2016)</ref>. As an additional part of the study, some teachers regularly provided written feedback on different aspects of their reading instruction <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Kraus et al., 2020)</ref>. The study was conducted in Bavaria, Germany, between 2018 and 2023.</p><p>By restricting the study sample to a geographically and age-related homogeneous sample from Southern Germany, we minimized the influence of different school closure durations and coping abilities of different countries. With respect to the time perspective, we consider short-term and long-term effects separately. Finally, in terms of the domain, we restricted ourselves to reading fluency, a readily measurable and well-defined construct.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reading Fluency</head><p>Reading fluency is one of the three sub-processes of reading: word reading (decoding), reading fluency, and reading comprehension <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Cadime et al., 2017)</ref>. Decoding can be simplified to the accuracy of reading and refers to the ability to translate (groups of) letters into sounds <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Lai et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Silverman et al., 2013)</ref>. Reading fluency is commonly defined through the automated reading of letters, words and sentences <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">(Silverman et al., 2013)</ref>. Finally, reading comprehension simplified means building a mental representation of the text upon a readers knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Kintsch, 1998)</ref>. The three sub-processes or sub-facets build on each other and are therefore considered to SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM EFFECTS OF THE COVID-19 SCHOOL CLOSURES 9 partly be prerequisites to each other <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Lai et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Psyridou et al., 2023)</ref>. While learning to decode is usually completed after the first years of reading lessons, reading fluency continues to develop until late secondary school (van de <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Ven et al., 2017)</ref>. Indeed, reading fluency develops quite homogeneously across a large period of time with an almost linear increase between grades two and six, and shows a slow flattening out towards the final level between grades six and nine <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Gärtner, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">Wimmer &amp; Mayringer, 2016)</ref>. While some authors divide reading fluency into reading accuracy, reading speed and prosody (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Kuhn et al., 2010)</ref>, we stick to the more narrow definition of reading fluency as reading speed, as proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Silverman et al. (2013)</ref> or <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Fuchs et al. (2001)</ref>. Therefore, studying the effects of school closures on reading fluency yields the advantage of having a theoretically well-founded, narrowly defined, and homogeneously developing construct.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>School Closure Effects on Reading Fluency</head><p>The fact that reading fluency is developing during elementary school and therefore susceptible to disruptions in the learning process, was also apparent in former analyses on the effects of school closures on reading fluency. Various European studies observed a significant learning loss or reduced learning progress in reading fluency, especially in younger students <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Baschenis et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Förster et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr">Nandi et al., 2023, e.g.)</ref>. Also, Starling-Alves et al., 2023 found a significant decline in fluency scores with the highest loss in grade two. <ref type="bibr">Alves et al.,</ref> 2022 reported a significant loss of reading fluency in second grade as well, but not in higher grades. Overall, Molnár and Hermann, 2023 reported an average learning loss of 0.25 SD, with lower primary school students particularly affected. Only few studies found that either older students suffered from greater loss than younger students <ref type="bibr">Kuhfeld, Soland, and Lewis, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Lerkkanen et al., 2023</ref> or reported non-significant or positive effects on reading fluency <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Hallin et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Richter et al., 2022)</ref>. Finally, a small sample study in Portugal by <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Rosendo et al., 2023</ref> found no statistically significant differences in accuracy, speed, and reading fluency performance, but significant differences in perceived fluency quality. To investigate whether these finding could be backed up by a causal analysis, we employed the Rubin causal model to analyze SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM EFFECTS OF THE COVID-19 SCHOOL CLOSURES 10 the effects of school closures in Southern German third graders on reading fluency.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Rubin Causal Model</head><p>The Rubin model <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(Rubin, 2005)</ref> is a formal mathematical framework for causal inference and relies on potential outcomes under treatment and control, defining a causal effect as the difference between observed and counterfactual outcomes. We aim to limit the range of these counterfactual outcomes by considering an extensive set of confounding variables such as gender, educational background, migration status, participation in a systematic intervention, and diverging pre-trends that could influence reading fluency development. At the same time, our findings are expected to have adequate external validity because our sample is large, demographically representative, and collected in an applied setting with regular teacher-led instruction (the reading intervention originally studied is now highly recommended by the Bavarian ministry of education as a curricular element in reading instruction).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary, Rationale, and Research Questions</head><p>The body of research reviewed indicates that the COVID-19 pandemic led to significant learning losses, particularly in mathematics and reading, with younger students and those from disadvantaged backgrounds being the most affected. However, there was also evidence that certain interventions, such as reading aloud at home, could mitigate potential losses. While reading was adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, the specific impacts varied widely based on factors such as grade level, SES, and geographical location. Reading fluency tended to be affected for younger students at the elementary school level. Most studies so far looked at short-term effects of school closures, for that it is intriguing to additionally gauge the long-term effects of COVID-related school closures.</p><p>Therefore, our study aims to compare the reading fluency development of a cohort of third graders affected by school closures with an expected development in the absence of school closures. Due to the design of our study, this expected development can be derived from a trend analysis of pre-COVID cohorts, conducted with the same population and the same measurement instrument, refined through in-depth comparison with a large matched post-COVID control SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM EFFECTS OF THE COVID-19 SCHOOL CLOSURES 11 cohort from the same study. This approach is seldom applied, because it requires large sample sizes and high data quality <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Furquim et al., 2019)</ref>. Both requirements may be assumed to be met by our sample as well as the pre-COVID cohorts. Our key research questions investigate (1) the short-term (after one month) and (2) long-term (after one year) effects of third-grade school closures on reading fluency.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method Sample</head><p>The sample of the main analysis of this study consisted of n = 9, 083 elementary students in Bavaria, Germany, divided into two cohorts.

Reading fluency was assessed using the SLS 2-9, <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">(Wimmer &amp; Mayringer, 2016)</ref>   <ref type="bibr">.98</ref>] (this study). Psychometric modeling indicated metric but not scalar measurement invariance for test versions. We tested metric measurement invariance in the item response theory (IRT) framework by fitting Rasch models <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Rasch, 1960)</ref> to every test version-specific subpopulation. This ensures that the factor structure (one-dimensional) and the discrimination parameters (set to one) are the same for all subpopulations. We removed items that were not solved in more than 99% of the observed results to speed up calculations. This led to j = 74 items of the 100 items being part of the analysis and a scale ranging up to 20 points above the average score of 54 in the last measurement occasion. Rasch models for every test version fit the data, as indicated by non-significant Andersen likelihood ratio tests <ref type="bibr">(Andersen, 1973, all</ref> p s &gt; .920). Furthermore, we tested for scalar measurment invariance by comparing multigroup IRT models with constraints on the item difficulty parameters to models without constraints in the difficulty parameters, in which the test versions represented the multiple groups. A subsequent model comparison indicated that unconstrained models fit the data significantly better (∆logLik = -10821.9, χ 2 = 21643.68, d f = 219; p &lt; .001). We therefore equated the response SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM EFFECTS OF THE COVID-19 SCHOOL CLOSURES 14 data for test versions <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Kolen &amp; Brennan, 2013)</ref>. We used equipercentile equating as described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Kolen and Brennan (2004)</ref>. Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> presents the results of the equating process, thus the mapping functions for our datasets. It shows that version SLS-C was consistently more difficult than the other test versions. This can be read of the equated scores presented on the y-axix for version C being higher than the original sum score represented on the x-axis. For all other versions we see that differences in difficulty emerge for higher raw scores hitting the amount of 60 sentences.</p><p>However, the display shows no other consistent pattern across measurement time points.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analyses</head><p>To assess causal effects, a Difference-in-Differences (DiD) approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Furquim et al., 2019)</ref> was applied. The underlying idea of DiD is to compare the changes in outcomes over time between a group that is exposed to a treatment (here: the COVID cohort) and a group that is not (here: the non-COVID cohort or control cohort). In our study, we compare several measures of reading fluency. Whereas for the COVID cohort the school closures fall in between these measurements, there were no school closures for the control cohort in between measurements, as SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM EFFECTS OF THE COVID-19 SCHOOL CLOSURES 15</p><p>this cohort was assessed one year after the COVID cohort. We then compare the differences with respect to the two groups between the differences with respect to the measurement time points.</p><p>For the DiDs to be meaningful, the study setup has to meet several assumptions.</p><p>One important assumption for DiD to be valid is the parallel assumption. It posits that, in the absence of the treatment, the difference in outcomes between the treatment group and the control group remained constant over time. In other words, any changes in the outcome for the control group over time should mirror the changes that would have occurred for the treatment group if the treatment had not been applied. Since this assumption tackles a counterfactual, it can never be observed. In consequence, there are several factual indicators that the parallel assumption is warranted. Specifically, we used pre-trend estimation <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">(Wing et al., 2018)</ref> and propensity score matching (for an exhaustive description, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Austin, 2011)</ref> to validate the parallel assumption.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pre-trend Estimation</head><p>For once, the trends in the outcomes for both the treatment and control groups should be similar before the treatment is implemented. In our example, we therefore also consider the Secondly, confounding influences on the treatment effect could be unevenly distributed between the treated and the control group. In our example socio-demographic variables, such as migration status and educational background, could influence the reading fluency development <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Gärtner, 2010)</ref>. Therefore, we used a matching algorithm to control for socio-demographic influences. We controlled for the fact, whether students received a systematic reading training vs.</p><p>regular lessons, for gender, for migration status and family language, and for the number of books in the household. By matching the COVID-cohort and the control cohort, we cannot rule out the overall influence of the confounding variables, but we can minimize the differential effects between the COVID-cohort and the control cohort. Therefore, average differences between the groups cannot be attributed to the influence of the confounding variables used in the matching process. To achieve this, we applied propensity score matching. The propensity score itself is defined as the probability of receiving the treatment (here: being affected by school closures) as a function of covariates -in our case the confounding variables discussed above. The propensity scores were estimated using a greedy k-nearest neighbors approach with k = 5 and a generalized linear model to estimate the distance. Afterwards, the propensity distances were transformed into weights by inverse probability weighting in the subsequent regressions, as proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Stuart et al. (2014)</ref>.</p><p>SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM EFFECTS OF THE COVID-19 SCHOOL CLOSURES 17</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Causal Analysis</head><p>The actual DiD were implemented in the framework of linear regression with robust clustered standard errors which controlled for longitudinal design dependencies.

Further, we double-checked the derived time trend by descriptive statistics and displayed the group-specific reading fluency development of our sample graphically (see Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>). We then modeled f (X time ) in two different ways: In one model, we used individual time points as dummy-coded variables. In a second model we assumed a linear time trend and estimated β time for a continuous variable representing the measurement time points in consecutive order (begin of 2 nd grade = 0, middle of 2 nd grade = 1, and so forth).</p><p>The interaction effects for the group variable with lag0 (before the school closures), with lag1 (right after the school closures) and with lag2 (one year after the school closures) were represented by additional dummy-coded variables for these specific time points. As described above, these allowed us to estimate possible derivations from the otherwise assumed constant time trend across groups. Finally, we allowed for correlated ε i whenever reading fluency values belonged to the same person. This accounted for the nested data structure of measurements being clustered inside persons.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Causal Analysis</head><p>Visual inspection of the descriptive development in our data did not show any apparent loss in reading fluency development in the COVID cohort during school closures (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref>). However, we observed some irregularities in reading fluency development between the end of third grade and the end of fourth grade. This led us to investigate, whether modeling time as a discrete rather than as a continuous variable would fit the data better. We therefore compared the fit of two regression models using a likelihood ratio test. The first regression model included a linear time trend, the second regression model a discrete time trend. The results displayed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref> show that the discrete time model fitted the data significantly better, indicated by a significant χ 2 -test and several fit indices, such as lower AIC and BIC for the discrete time trend model.</p><p>We therefore interpreted the model with a discrete time trend. The parameter estimates of the model are displayed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref>.</p><p>Our first finding was that our sample had a higher average in SLS scores at the beginning SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM EFFECTS OF THE COVID-19 SCHOOL CLOSURES 22 Finally, the regression analysis supported the descriptive finding that school closures had no causal effect on reading fluency.

This means that the time trend estimated by f (X time ) did not vary significantly after the school closures in comparison to the time point before the school closures.

All time and group effects together accounted for 10% of the variance in  SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM EFFECTS OF THE COVID-19 SCHOOL CLOSURES 24</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>In this study, we identified the effect of COVID-related school closures on reading fluency during third grade in Germany. We found that there was neither a significant short-term loss (one month after the school closures) nor a significant long-term loss (one year after the school closures). The absence of learning losses was evidenced by consistent time trends between a control cohort and a cohort affected by COVID-related school closures at the respective time points.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Interpretation of Results</head><p>Our findings partly contradict several international research findings, which indicated that COVID-related school closures had in fact detrimental effects on reading fluency e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Betthäuser et al., 2023</ref> and align with other research results, especially for Germany, such as Depping et al.</p><p>(2021) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Förster et al. (2023), and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Schult et al. (2022b)</ref>. However, previous research projects primarily employed cross-sectional, observational designs, making it difficult to attribute their reported effects causally to the school closures.</p><p>In our study, we adopted a longitudinal approach and applied causal analysis. To define causality in non-experimental settings, it is essential to closely confine the counterfactual Another favorable aspect of our research design was the ability to control for factors influencing learning loss during the COVID-19 pandemic. We restricted our sample to one region in Germany (Bavaria), which ensures that the duration of school closures was identical for all students in the sample. We also confined our sample to third-graders, thereby minimizing differential effects for different age groups observed in other studies (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Domingue et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Molnár &amp; Hermann, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Starling-Alves et al., 2023)</ref>.</p><p>Since multiple studies have shown that demographic characteristics such as personal student background influence the impact of school closures on learning loss, we used propensity score weighting to balance these influences between our affected and control cohorts.</p><p>Additionally, as instruction quality affects the development of reading fluency <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(Schilcher et al., 2022)</ref> -and some of our sample had participated in a systematic reading fluency intervention during or before entering the study -we accounted for intervention participation in the propensity score estimation. This led to balanced distributions regarding demographic and instructional variables and limited confounding influences on the effect of school closures on reading fluency in our study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations Toward Causal Interpretations</head><p>Despite our efforts to rigorously control our research design, there are potential threats to a valid causal interpretation of our findings. While past research consistently indicated that breaks SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM EFFECTS OF THE COVID-19 SCHOOL CLOSURES 26 from instruction are detrimental to learning (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Schult et al., 2022b)</ref>, the extent to which COVID-related school closures led to instructional interruptions is unclear. Bavarian schools offered distance relatively early during the closures, which might have been as effective as regular in-person instruction, at least regarding reading fluency. While findings of <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Schult et al. (2022b)</ref> suggest otherwise, we still cannot rule out that teachers focused their reading instruction on reading fluency during COVID school closures because it is relatively easy to implement in a distance learning setting (compared to instruction on reading comprehension). Indeed, previous findings from our sample indicate that some teachers turned to the systematic reading fluency intervention from our study during second grade, as they felt unable to deliver the planned reading comprehension intervention scheduled for third grade <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">(Wild et al., 2022)</ref>.</p><p>Additionally, our control cohort consistently outperformed the COVID cohort even before the school closures. Notably, the control cohort experienced school closures during grade two.</p><p>This possibly led to increased efforts by teachers and parents to compensate for perceived or actual learning losses from the recent school closures. Between the end of grade three and the middle of grade four, we observed an unusually high increase in reading fluency, followed by the COVID cohort catching up to the control cohort by the end of grade four. This catch-up coincided with stagnation or a slight decrease in the control cohort's reading fluency, which deviates from the expected linear development suggested by norm data and previous studies using the SLS. One possible explanation is that the last measurement in the control cohort occurred just before the summer break, potentially resulting in low motivation for the additional test. Another explanation could be selective dropout (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Depping et al., 2021)</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Implications for External Validity</head><p>There are certain particularities of our study that should be considered when generalizing our findings to other abilities, populations, or settings. Firstly, we investigated the development of a skill that was assumed to be internalized and mostly automated before the school closures.</p><p>Learning losses due to breaks in instruction are particularly detrimental when the learning process is still in an early stage a stable level of proficiency has not yet been attained. If we had examined reading comprehension, which is still developing in third grade, the school closures might have shown a more severe impact on its development. This was also suggested by an earlier study on the same cohort <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">(Wild et al., 2022)</ref>. Secondly, reading fluency is a skill that can be maintained without extensive in-person instructional effort once a stable level has been reached <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Kuhn &amp; Stahl, 2003)</ref>. The Bavarian State Ministry for education therefore reacted at an early stage and provided parents with instructions and materials for an easy-to-implement reading fluency training at home. Therefore, it is possible that teachers, parents, and even students themselves managed well to compensate for the lack of in-person teaching during the school closures. If so, the strong relationship between reading fluency and parental support in reading <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Bus et al., 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Oostdam et al., 2024)</ref> as well as as the influence of the SES <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Depping et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Engzell et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Hammerstein et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr">Kuhfeld, Soland, &amp; Lewis, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Segers et al., 2023)</ref> may have shown even more clearly during the school closures and closed the expected gap.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>Our study shows that the widely spread perception that school closures were catastrophic for learning (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bailey, Duncan, Murnane, &amp; Yeung, 2021)</ref> needs to be reconsidered with greater nuance. It is important to keep in mind that we only examined reading fluency during the third grade -this is a specific skill during a specific period and cannot be generalized to the overall effect of school closures on learning. However, at least for skills that have been mostly internalized and automated, such as reading fluency in third graders, the effects of COVID-related SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM EFFECTS OF THE COVID-19 SCHOOL CLOSURES 28 school closures may not have been as severe as initially assumed by early predictive studies (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Kuhfeld et al., 2020)</ref> or the general public <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Howard, 2023)</ref>.

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_6"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>development. We therefore had to confine our expected reading fluency development without school closures as closely as possible. First, we adhered to a simple and clear definition of reading fluency, operationalized by the number of sentences read in a standardized reading test within a set time period. Using a normed standardized test instrument allowed us to compare the reading fluency development of our sample to the average expected development from pre-COVID studies using the same test<ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Peters et al., 2021)</ref> and a sample from the test norming procedure. Additionally, reading fluency is assumed to develop rapidly during elementary school, making changes measurable, and to develop homogeneously, following a linear trend until about grade six<ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Gärtner, 2010)</ref>. Our pre-trend analysis supported these assumptions and showed a linear half-annual increase in reading fluency, homogeneous across the performance range. The homogeneous linear development over time and the availability of a test covering a wide range of SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM EFFECTS OF THE COVID-19 SCHOOL CLOSURES 25 reading fluency allowed us to measure reading fluency consistently with the same instrument from the beginning of grade two to the end of grade four, enabling direct comparisons of test scores across these time points. Finally, the DiD analysis on our sample also indicated the expected linear half-annual increases in reading fluency. In summary, the choice of an ability with a homogeneous development, a narrow definition of the construct fluency, and the measurement with a standardized instrument allowed us to control time-dependent trends in our causal analysis. The inclusion of multiple measurement points made it also possible to differentiate between short-term and long-term effects, which were both non-significant and complement each other in the general interpretation of our results.</figDesc></figure>

In summary, while we controlled for time trends, demographic variables, and some instructional factors, such as participation in a systematic reading intervention, extraordinary instructional efforts in the control cohort post school closures, and selective dropout pose a caveat to the causal interpretation of our findings. Given the observed deviations from expected SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM EFFECTS OF THE COVID-19 SCHOOL CLOSURES 27 development starting after grade three, caution is warranted -particularly regarding the causal interpretation of the long-term effects of school closures on reading fluency.</figDesc></figure>
