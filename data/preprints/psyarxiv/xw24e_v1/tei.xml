<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>BACKGROUND: Modern Artificial Intelligence (AI) has shown promise in identifying psychopathology based on the language used by patients, providing a scalable method for obtaining relevant behavioral markers. However, no existing models for assessing posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have successfully demonstrated out-of-sample replicability. We develop a language-based AI model for PTSD and rigorously evaluate replicability in a prospective sample.</p><p>METHODS: Participants from the Stony Brook World Trade Center (WTC) Health and Wellness Program described their lives in an automated interview during a clinical monitoring visit. The language was analysed using AI to assess PTSD CheckList (PCL) for total symptom severity score and four symptom subscales and validated against medical record PTSD diagnosis.</p><p>To yield realistic accuracy estimates in this cross-sectional study, we propose the Sequential Evaluation with Model Pre-registration design, consisting of an iterative, two-phase preregistration paradigm. The first pre-registration specifies the data split, the model development, and the initial hypotheses. The second pre-registration specifies the exact pre-trained models, data cleaning procedures, and the refined hypotheses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS:</head><p>The data split included a development (N=1437) and a prospective (N=346) dataset. Within the prospective sample, the pre-registered models produced scores that significantly correlated with their targets: PCL total (r=.38, p-value&lt;.001) and the four subscales (r=.28-.37, p-value&lt;.001). The pre-registered model for PCL total showed a robust association with PTSD diagnosis (AUC=.76), significantly outperforming demographics (AUC=.61, p-value=.006), WTC attack exposures (AUC=.61, p-value=.007) and a validated depression language model (AUC=.60, p-value&lt;.001).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONSLUSIONS:</head><p>We developed new AI-language assessments of PTSD symptom severity. Within a clinical setting and over prospectively collected participant data, the assessments replicated with high convergent validity with self-report and high external validity against diagnosis in medical records. Analyses of observable behavioral markers in automated clinical interview language can produce robust psychiatric assessments, overcoming limitations found in traditional assessments.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) manifests in heterogeneous symptom severity patterns, which are not easily expressed by patients via the closed-ended response formats found in traditional, structured assessments <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2)</ref>. Diagnostic interviews and self-reports rely on subjective interpretations from either the clinician (interview) or the patient (self-report), leading to idiosyncratic biases <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>. New assessment methods are needed to reduce these limitations and complement current methods.</p><p>Recent advances in AI-based language analyses have demonstrated promise for increasing the validity and scope of mental health assessment <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8)</ref>. However, for PTSD in particular, evaluations have typically been limited to either (a) models trained to assess other conditions (e.g., AI models for detecting depression, anxiety, and sentiment evaluated against PTSD symptom severity; <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> or (b) models trained for PTSD but evaluated against non-clinical outcomes (e.g., public selfdisclosures of PTSD; <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Moreover, many of these have been derived from social media language (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> rather than data collected in clinical settings. The lack of comprehensive evaluations is underscored by recent work demonstrating that AI models can fail to perform when evaluated prospectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref>.</p><p>A central concern surrounding the validity of AI-based models for detecting psychopathology is that standard assessment evaluation practices do not directly translate directly to AI-based approaches. Whereas standard pre-registration practices are suitable for many research goals, they fall short in meeting the needs for developing and evaluating "robust models" for translational research. For example, pre-registration practices that require specifying exact data processing steps when larger and more complex datasets (e.g., open-ended language) needed for AI model training often require unexpected bug fixes, several preprocessing steps, and hyper-parameter tuning that only come to light during model development stages <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20)</ref>. Further, it is best practice in AI to evaluate models over held-out samples to control for overfit among these complex models (i.e., cross-validation; <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref>), which is not typical in pre-registered studies. In short, AI model development often involves an iterative refinement process that does not fit well within the standard, a priori pre-registration paradigms that have been developed for the purpose of traditional hypothesis testing. In fact, commonly used pre-registration paradigms can be understood to work against research aims more commonly found in machine learning, namely, developing models with incredibly high accuracy.</p><p>Here, we develop and evaluate new AI clinical models for assessing the severity of PTSD and related symptom domains. We propose a new evaluation paradigm, Sequential Evaluation with Model Pre-registration (SEMP), that aims to combine good scientific practices (i.e., preregistration) with robust AI model development practices (i.e., bug fixes, hyper-parameter tuning, and out-of-sample test). SEMP calls for first developing the model and then registering it (i.e., literally the model code and weights). We first register the steps for training the models and then register the models before testing them on new prospective data (see Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). By registering the models before testing, the approach mitigates the overestimation of accuracies for clinical prediction models by <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> preventing overfitting of hyper-parameters (whether purposeful or accidental); <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> mitigating the risk of test data leakswhen data from the test set inadvertently influences decisions in the training process, thereby yielding overestimated accuracy for new, unseen data; and (3) when using a prospective test set, more realistically testing the model being applied to a sample later in time as would happen in practice.</p><p>We apply SEMP when analyzing language from automated spoken interviews from a clinical visit to assess overall and domain-specific PTSD symptom severity over a cohort of 1783 World Trade Center emergency responders 20 years after the traumatic event. By using language-based assessments, responders are free to express the heterogeneous ways in which PTSD symptoms manifest during their everyday lives. The language is thus an open-ended behavioral, observable marker for assessing PTSD severity. We hypothesized that pre-registered AI-based models produce robust PTSD severity assessments, which are further evaluated against external criteria (i.e., medical records). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to prospectively evaluate AI models developed specifically for PTSD and its symptom domains.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>METHOD</head><p>Design: Sequential Evaluation with Model Pre-registration SEMP is a two-phase procedure to pre-register models before using held-out test-data. The Development Phase comprises developing the models; the Evaluation Phase involves a preregistration locking in the exact models and preprocessing (data cleaning) code. The two-phase procedure enables iteratively developing the preprocessing and modeling choices (i.e., "hyperparameter optimization") without using the test-data such that final accuracies will be established more robustly on held-out, optionally prospective data. Instead of testing whether models produce assessment accuracies better than chance, the development phase enables one to register specific effect-size intervals for the evaluation phase.</p><p>Within the SEMP procedure, we first developed the AI-based PTSD symptoms models using automatically transcribed language from video-recorded automated clinical interviews over a development "training-set" sample. This was done for pre-registration phase 1 (the development phase) to produce and pre-register pre-trained models. In the second phase (the evaluation phase), we applied the pre-registered models to a "prospective held-out test" sample consisting of new participants. The base hypothesis for the evaluation phase is that the models trained during the development phase will continue to predict their intended outcomes on the unseen data. To strengthen hypotheses, we included expected correlational accuracy ranges:</p><p>The registered language-based assessments of PTSD produce scores that: a) are positively associated with PTSD symptom severity, b) achieve a correlation r ≥ . <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> for overall symptom severity and r ≥ .18 for the four individual symptom domain dimensions (based on training-set cross-validated r=.41, 99% CI [.35, .46], N=1437 for the combined symptom severity and r=.25, 99% CI [.18, .31] for the individual symptom dimensions, N=1422), and c) are predictive above and beyond the pre-trained models using baseline demographics: age, gender, occupation, and race.</p><p>In our case, we also had hypotheses beyond testing an AI model (i.e., those based on pre-existing language-based models) that also accompanied the SEMP process (depicted at the bottom of Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> as "sequential hypothesis pre-registration"; see section 3 in the Supplement for these hypotheses).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>Participants were recruited from the Stony Brook WTC Health and Wellness Program, where their health has been monitored over several years. Participant data was split into two non-temporally overlapping parts: The "development" data (2021-09-09 -2022-07-29) and the held-out prospective "evaluation" data (2022-08-01 -2022-09-30). The development data totaled 1437 participants (Female=7%, Male=93%; Mean age=57.9, SD=8.0 years; 14.5% with reported PTSD diagnosis in their medical record)the prospective data includes an additional 346 participants (Female=9%, Male=91%; Mean age=58.5, SD=7.8 years; 15.6% with reported PTSD diagnosis in their medical record) enrolled prospectively relative to the participants in the development dataset (see Supplement section 1).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Automated clinical interviews: Video-recorded answers about life</head><p>Participants were recorded while answering questions automatically shown on a screen in a private room during a clinical visit (i.e., an automated clinical interview). Questions probed respondents to describe positive (e.g., What are the three things in your life that you look forward to the most right now?) and negative aspects of their (past, present, and future) life in general (e.g., nicest and worst things, challenges, support network) and in relation to serious events (e.g., COVID-19 and 9/11; e.g., How does 9/11 affect you now?; see Supplement section 2 for all questions). To maximize the generalizability of content, the questions aimed at being broad using layman's terms (rather than, e.g., asking about specific clinical symptoms). The questions were presented on a screen with instructions on how not to read the questions out loud and to try spending at least 60 seconds answering each question. While the questions were updated and changed over three iterations of the development phase to increase engagement and more detailed answers, the questions were the same for everyone in the evaluation data test. The recording for those responding with at least 150 words (the pre-registered threshold) took, on average, 7.5 minutes (SD=4.1; range=1.1-43.0).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The PTSD CheckList</head><p>The PTSD CheckList (PCL; <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref>) comprises 17 items assessing PTSD symptom severity based on DSM-IV. Respondents are asked to consider the previous months, answering using rating scales ranging from 1 (not at all) to 5 (extremely). We computed the total mean score and the four subscales <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24)</ref>, including Re-experiencing (e.g., intrusive thoughts of trauma), Avoidance (e.g., avoiding thoughts of trauma), Emotional Numbing (e.g., inability to recall aspects of trauma), and Hyperarousal (e.g., sleep disturbance). Cronbach alphas were acceptable for all scales in both datasets (≥ .70, see Supplement section 1).</p></div>

Further, all the PCL models based on language and demographics, except for the Re-experience subscale, produced significantly less error than the pre-registered baseline models using only demographics (rs=.10-.15; age, gender, occupation, and race).

The preregistered models yielded correlations in the prospective dataset corresponding to the crossvalidated correlations in the development dataset, where all correlations were above the pre-registered cut-offs. These results were also true for the PTSD severity subscales: Re-experiencing, Avoidance, Numbing, and Hyperarousal. Further, all the assessment models based on language and demographics, except for Re-experiencing, produced significantly less error than the baseline models based on only demographics. Notably, the SEMP procedure enables researchers to produce precise hypotheses regarding the effect size (which is uncommon in current practice).</p><p>Importantly, the pre-registered models were subjected to an external validation against PTSD diagnosis from individuals' medical records. The AUC score (.76) was significantly higher than baselines including demographics, exposures, and a previous state-of-the-art depression severity model <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>; the AUC score was well above the cut-off for common clinical standards (.70, e.g., see the COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement INstruments; COSMIN; <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(35)</ref>).</p><p>According to the second set of research questions, pre-trained n-gram models for depression and anxiety were positively correlated with observed PTSD severity. Further, the three pre-registered topics were significantly related to PTSD severity. Patients using language part of topics indicating struggles with stress, anxiety, and pain; control, and mental health issues are more likely to report higher PTSD severity. These findings provide insights about the type of language related to PTSD severity, and they are consistent with research showing that PTSD is comorbid with mental health issues, including depression, anxiety, and stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Implications</head><p>The AI-language models produced robust, behavior-based psychiatric assessments when evaluated prospectively over patients unseen by the model. This supports their strong potential clinical utility. The open-endedness of language responses allows patients to freely express heterogeneous symptoms and their unique experiences (1,2); the automated data collection and analyses of interview language can function as robust and scalable behavioral markers for research and clinical assessment among populations where the models have been prospectively evaluated. AI-based assessment methods have the potential to go beyond the current reliance on closed-ended rating scales, for example, they are suitable for screening <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(35)</ref> in telemedicine <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(38)</ref> or as outcome variables in Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs).</p><p>Our new study design for rigorously developing and evaluating clinical AI-models -SEMPyields results that are safeguarded against accuracy over-estimations. Accuracy estimations are crucial when implementing clinical AI-models <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(35)</ref>. As such, the SEMP design could play the same critical role in developing and evaluating clinical AI assessment as the RCT design for evaluating interventions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations</head><p>While we suggest a procedure to assess the generalizability of AI models, the context for our analyses should still be considered. First, the AI models were developed and validated over a specific populationemergency responders to the WTC attacks. Future research should examine generalizability to other populations and traumas. Second, during the development phase, the interview questions underwent two iterations. The most substantial difference was that participants in the later stages (approximately 65% of the participants in the development and 100% in the prospective dataset) answered questions about the COVID-19 pandemic. Importantly, though, the final question set used during development was also used for evaluation within the prospective dataset, and having the exact same questions across all phases would likely have provided for greater accuracy. Additionally, motivated to prompt language generalizable to multiple outcomes, interview questions concerned participants' lives and experiences overall rather than specific clinical symptoms (e.g., see <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40)</ref>), but further work is needed to verify if the question set actually generalizes better. Lastly, the models were trained to self-reported severity, while other options for PTSD assessment exist. Still, our validation against PTSD diagnosis from medical records mitigates this limitation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>Our pre-registered models demonstrated reliable and accurate assessments in prospective data, showing convergent validity with self-report and external validity with PTSD diagnoses from medical records. The accuracy of our language-based PTSD severity assessments outperforms models based on demographics, exposures, and depression. By introducing new safeguards to evaluate models, we demonstrate robust results supporting the potential of language-based assessments in psychiatric research and practice. Analyses of behavioral, observable markers in automated interview language produced robust, scalable psychiatric assessments, overcoming limitations found in traditional assessments.</p><p>Section 1: Hypotheses, methods, analyses, and results for pre-registration 1</p><p>In this section, we describe the hypotheses, methods, analyses, and results for pre-registration 1.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reliability of the PCL</head><p>We computed the total mean score (Cronbach alpha [𝛂 development set/prospective set] = .95/.93; Hierarchical omega (𝛚 developing set/prospective set]) = .82/.81) and the four subscales (4,28), including Reexperiencing (𝛂 = .90/.86; 𝛚 = .87/.78), Avoidance (𝛂 = .84/.76; 𝛚 = -), Numbing (𝛂 = .95/.82; 𝛚 =.82/.82), and Hyperarousal (𝛂 = .87/.85; 𝛚 = .84/.70).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Description of the analyses in the development set</head><p>In pre-registration 1 we did not specify the diarization and removal of instances where respondents read the questions out loud (they were specified in pre-registration 2). The pre-processing, including transcriptions and diarization, and removing parts where respondents read the question out loud were developed in the development set as specified in the main paper and below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Preprocessing</head><p>Audio from the recordings was transcribed using Whisper Large (v2; (30)), a state-of-the-art AI transcription model. The average word error rate was 2.18% (over 28 randomly selected transcripts); calculated as the ratio between the number of word changes made to the Whisper transcriptions to match human transcriptions. Subsequently, the transcriptions were stripped of segments corresponding to the interviewer's speech using the Pyannote speaker-diarization AI model <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(31)</ref>. After verifying that the interviewee always spoke the most by an order of magnitude, we limited the text to that identified as the most frequent speaker.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Removing parts where respondents read the question out loud</head><p>Within the training data, we noticed a strong variation in how participants read the questions on the screen aloud. To limit analyses to the participants' original language, the reading of questions was removed by automatically finding sequences of tokens that matched the subsequences of the questions. The approach to remove questions used a 2-gram lexicon, topics, and contextualized word embeddings (that capture longer sequences) from a large language model (RoBERTa-large, layer 23; (32)) as features in a ridge regression model (( <ref type="formula">33</ref>)). To evaluate its accuracy, one of the authors labeled 55 transcriptions (see Supplement for more information). The question detection model yielded an accuracy of 97% (F1 = .78, AUC = .94; using 10-fold cross-validation).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Linguistic feature extraction</head><p>As specified in pre-registration 1, three types of language features were extracted on the development set, including 1) word embeddings from a large language model (RoBERTa-large, layer 23; Liu et al., 2019) which have been found suitable for human-level predictions from word embeddings (Ganesan et al., 2021), 2) words and phrases encoded as relative frequencies and as binary indicators, and 3) topics (N = 300) prevalence scores based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA; <ref type="bibr">Blei et al., 2003)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Model training and selection</head><p>Models were examined using cross-validation. Following the procedure described in pre-registration 1 the models were developed using all development data using ridge regression with a penalty ranging from 10 1 to 10 6 . We created models for PCL total and the four subscales based on i) only language, ii) only the demographic controls, and iii) language and demographic controls.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Significance testing accuracy from different assessment models</head><p>To significance test the accuracy of two language-based assessment models, the accuracy of model A (ŷ1) and model B (ŷ2) to predict (i.e., estimate) the observed scores (y) were compared using a paired t-test between the absolute error from ŷ1-y and ŷ2-y.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Lexicon</head><p>To quantify the associations between PTSD severity and related theoretically grounded dimensions, we used a lexicon trained on Facebook and Twitter language <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Park et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Schwartz et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Guntuku et al., 2019)</ref> to predict their self-reported neuroticism, depression, and anxiety. These lexicons were applied to the language data to derive a language-based estimate of the expression of these constructs in the participants' language.</p><p>We had registered only to include the 1400 most frequently used words, which resulted in substantially lower significance, although here we present both results).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Domain Adaptation.</head><p>The language-based models for depression, anxiety, and neuroticism were trained on 10s of 1000s of Facebook users, which have been shown to be effective in previous works <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Eichstaedt et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Guntuku et al., 2019)</ref>. However, the depression, anxiety, and neuroticism scores estimated for these interviews using models trained on language that has different lexical usage patterns would result in large errors <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Rieman et al., 2017)</ref>. Thus, as part of exploratory analyses (i.e., not part of pre-registration 1 and not used in pre-registration 2), these models were adapted to account for the change in domain, which acts as a forcing function to the change in lexical usage. In this process, we removed the words that had dissimilar distributions in terms of either frequency or sparsity from the source (FB lexica) and re-trained the model from scratch.</p><p>Open vocabulary. To assess respondents' re-experience of the World Trade Center attack, we selected five and seven LDA topics relating to re-experiencing the attack (as specified in the pre-registration 1).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Closed vocabulary.</head><p>To assess Death, First-person singular pronouns (I, me, my) and First-person plural pronouns (we, our), Linguistic Inquiry, and Word Count (LIWC-22; Boyd et al., 2022) dictionaries were used (as specified in the pre-registration 1). The LIWC dictionaries are comprised of psychologically meaningful categories of words that have been developed and extensively validated by psychologists. The assessment is computed as the relative frequency of each LIWC dictionary by summing the withinparticipant word frequencies within each of the three LIWC dictionaries.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Word clouds</head><p>Topics that are significantly associated with PCL scores after controlling for demographics and multiple corrections using Bonferroni correction were plotted using DLATK defaults (as specified in the preregistration 1).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Missing data, exclusions, and transformation</head><p>Participants with responses of fewer than 150 words were excluded from the analyses. We had registered 100 words as a response to the life narrative as a minimum for including a participant in the analyses in pre-registration 1. However, we found that a minimum of 150 words yielded more accurate results, which we thus registered for pre-registration 2. We are presenting the 150 threshold for consistency even for the pre-registration 1 hypothesis below. We also present analyses showing accuracy across different word response cut-offs. Missing data were imputed for PCL total scores by computing the mean, where participants had answered at least 14 of the 17 items (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Schafer &amp; Graham, 2002)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures Unique for Pre-registration 1</head><p>The Short Form 12 (SF-12) Health Survey Physical and mental health was assessed using the SF-12 <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Ware et al., 1995)</ref> from the Short Form 36 Health Survey <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Brazier et al., 1992)</ref>, which focuses on functional status, well-being, and overall evaluation of health. It includes 12 closed-ended items assessing eight broad domains: Physical functioning, Social functioning, Role limitations (physical problems), Role limitations (emotional problems), Pain, Mental Health, Vitality, and General health perception. From the SF-12, we computed the Physical Component Summary (PCS) and Mental Component Summary (MCS) using standardized procedures based on regression weights <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Ware et al., 1995)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Labeling scheme for when participants read questions out loud</head><p>The labeling scheme developed during analyses of the development set comprised three levels indicating different degrees of the extent to which the respondent was reading the question out loud (see below). The first author labeled fifty-eight transcripts; twenty were transcribed by a research assistant to examine the inter-rater reliability. Overlap was calculated as average(number of spans matched / total number of spans), i.e., average(Jaccard). A span is considered to be matched if, between two annotators, there is at least a 50% overlap. The inter-rater correlation was .60. In the final analyses, the models were trained to predict levels 2 -4 as indicative of a part where participants read the question out loud.</p></div>

These include: a) language-based anxietypositive association, b) language-based depressionpositive association, c) topic 288 (on stress, anxiety, and pain); d) topic 286 (on control), and e) topic 65 (on mental health issues).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Details about measures</head><p>WTC exposure. The questions regarding WTC exposure concerned 9/11, including 1) being caught in the dust cloud, 2) death of a colleague, family member, or friend, 3) knowing someone who was injured, 4) involved in search and rescue efforts, 5) working primarily at or adjacent to the towers collapse site, 6) exposure to human remains of victims, 7) early arrival (i.e., on 9/11 or 9/12 2001), 8) long work on-site (i.e., total hours worked in the top quartile of this sample), 9) slept on-site any nights during September or October 2021, 10) worked on-site every day from 9/11 to 9/30. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Redistributing prediction to better comply with clinical standards</head><p>AI models have a tendency to "shrink" the variance as part of their regularization, which we did not adjust for in our primary results. Applying the PCL cut-off of 44, commonly used in the literature, the model predictions yield a sensitivity of 0 and a specificity of 1. This is because the distribution of the prediction models has changed. One potential concern with many machine learning-based approaches for regression is that they are not typically constrained to have a similar variance and distribution as the training outcome.</p><p>In particular, penalization, by definition, shrinks the variance to avoid overfit and often outputs a more normal distribution than the training outcome. These issues have a negligible effect on typical accuracy metrics such as correlation, but when put into practice, they can make predicted outcomes harder to interpret for practitioners used to scales having particular cut-offs, ranges, and distributional shapes. Next, we show how it is possible to update the model to yield a more similar distribution to the training outcome.</p><p>Redistributing the predictions was solved through two general steps: (1) Anscombe-loss: adding a transformation to account for shape during training and (2) adding a variance transformation (called "predictive redistribution"; <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Giorgi et al., 2022)</ref> on the output of the regression predictions. Hence, we executed the following steps:</p><p>1. Transformed PCL scores using Anscombe (e.g., see <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Anscombe, 1973)</ref> 2y + 38</p><p>2. Trained the language models to the Anscombe transformed PCL scores.  Applying the PCL cutoff of 44 on the redistributed model predictions now provides a sensitivity of .96 and a sensitivity of .11. Applying the PCL cut-off of 27 (which is the cutoff with the highest balanced accuracy for observed PCL scores in the development set), the model predictions yield a sensitivity of .70, and a specificity of .70. This is because the distribution of the prediction model has changed, where the redistributed model yields a sensitivity of .78 and a specificity of .66.</p><p>Table Supplement 11.
