<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>A fundamental aspect of human experience is that of being a bounded and embodied agent. This basic sense of self typically operates implicitly, yet traditional contemplative accounts alongside recent work in philosophy, phenomenology and neuroscience suggests that it can be attenuated or even fully dissolved while retaining awareness. Here we present an extended analysis of data from a large-scale neurophenomenological study investigating such minimal modes of awareness, in which 46 long-term meditators alternated between resting-state and meditative conditions of self-boundary (SB) dissolution and maintenance during magnetoencephalography. Results show global increases in broadband entropy rate and directed information transfer in both meditation conditions compared to rest. Spectral decomposition of both measures reveals that broadband effects are driven mostly by high-frequency activity, and that information transfer and entropy rates exhibit qualitatively different spectral patterns. Although these global changes don't clearly differentiate meditative self-boundary dissolution, localized reductions in information transfer from the anterior cingulate to mid and post cingulate and in high-beta entropy rate in sensorimotor and posterior-medial cortices did differentiate the meditation conditions. Furthermore, a relative reduction of broadband orbitofrontal cortex entropy rate, and broadband information transfer from occipital, cingulate, limbic and subcortical areas, both correlated strongly with SB-dissolution phenomenology. Together with a previously reported neural correlate from the same dataset of reduced high-beta power in the posterior-medial cortex, these two neural correlates synergistically explained over half the variance in phenomenological dissolution scores (R² = 0.52), exhibiting a neurophenomenological association of unprecedented strength. By integrating nuanced phenomenology with multiscale neural metrics, our findings provide novel insight into self-attenuation and advance the empirical investigation of minimal phenomenal experience.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The sense of self is a core feature of ordinary conscious experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Blanke, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Christoff et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Gallagher, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">James, 1890)</ref>. Theoretical accounts describe the self as a dynamic construct or process with various aspects <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Gallagher, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Gallagher &amp; Zahavi, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Metzinger, 2003)</ref>, yet many converge on a distinction between two main aspects -the reflective ("me") and pre-reflective ("I") sense of self (e.g. in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Damasio, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Gallagher, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">James, 1890)</ref>. The latter, more basic form of self-consciousness has been referred to as minimal self <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Gallagher, 2000)</ref>, minimal phenomenal selfhood <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Blanke &amp; Metzinger, 2009)</ref>, pre-reflective self <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Legrand, 2006)</ref> and embodied self <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Seth, 2013)</ref> and is thought to be the fundamental layer on which other aspects are built. This aspect of the self is typically manifested through features such as self-location, a first-person perspective, a sense of body ownership and a sense of agency -which together constitute a dynamic functional boundary between self and non-self <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Christoff et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Ratcliffe, 2008)</ref>. While usually implicit and persisting, these features can undergo profound alteration, and attenuation, in altered states of consciousness such as meditative and psychedelic states <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Josipovic, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Letheby &amp; Gerrans, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Millière et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Nave et al., 2021)</ref>. Such attenuations in the sense of self are a hallmark of states described as "pure awareness" or "minimal phenomenal experience" (MPE) <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Metzinger, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Windt, 2015)</ref>. These are thought of as the simplest form of detectable conscious experience, with minimal or no conceptual content and devoid of representations of self, time and a spatial frame of reference <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Metzinger, 2020)</ref>. The occurrence of such states during meditation have been demonstrated and phenomenologically characterized in an initial yet comprehensive project <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Gamma &amp; Metzinger, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Metzinger, 2024)</ref>. MPEs have been suggested as a unique entry point to the study of consciousness, potentially allowing a minimal-model explanation for consciousness by accounting for the core causal factors giving rise to the phenomenon <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Metzinger, 2020)</ref>. Therefore, systematically studying states in which the sense of self, down to its most minimal and basic embodied aspects, are attenuated hold potential for advancing the scientific study of consciousness.</p><p>Given the implicit nature of the minimal self, operationalizing it for empirical research is inherently difficult. However, this difficulty can be addressed by leveraging two key elements: the trained skills of long-term meditation practitioners, and in-depth phenomenological interviews, which allow suspension of naive beliefs about one's experience and guide attention toward its pre-reflective facets <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Petitmengin, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Varela &amp; Shear, 1999)</ref>. Accumulating evidence suggests that long-term meditators can reliably and repeatedly enter targeted altered states of consciousness <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Lutz et al., 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">, Thompson et al., 2005)</ref>, and can suspend multiple facets of selfhood during global forms of self-dissolution <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Ataria et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Dor-Ziderman et al., 2013</ref><ref type="bibr">, 2016)</ref>. The ability to volitionally enter such states renders long-term meditators as a uniquely fit population for neurophenomenological investigation dissolution of the minimal, pre-reflective self. Neurophenomenology <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">(Varela, 1996)</ref> offers a framework for bridging the explanatory gap between first-person experience and third-person physiology by combining first-person methods such as phenomenological interviewing, with third-person physiological measures in an iterative cycle <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Berkovich-Ohana et al., 2020)</ref>. This approach has proven effective for systematically characterizing altered states of consciousness (reviewed in <ref type="bibr">Timmerman et al., 2023)</ref>.</p><p>Building on this promising methodological ground, in this paper we attempt a comprehensive exploratory analysis of a unique and large-scale neurophenomenological dataset investigating self-boundary (SB) dissolution in meditation <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Nave et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Trautwein et al., 2024)</ref>. The data were obtained from 46 experienced meditators who entered meditative states in which they volitionally attenuated their self-boundaries, alongside an active-control meditative state of maintaining self-boundaries and a resting state (see Methods for elaboration). Interviews inspired by the micro-phenomenological method <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Petitmengin, 2006)</ref> were conducted, participants' experiences were mapped and the success of SB-dissolution was subsequently quantified <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Nave et al., 2021)</ref>. Participants that achieved full-fledged SB-dissolution reported an immersion in undifferentiated space, lacking first-person observer position and distinctions between experienced content and experiencing subject <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Nave et al., 2021)</ref>. Although such states usually retain some residual experiential qualities, they approach MPE by minimizing distinguishable conceptual and structural representations of self and world. MPE have been described through qualitative and quantitative retrospective reports <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Gamma &amp; Metzinger, 2021</ref>), yet reproductions in the lab as well as close-up microphenomenology is still lacking (but see <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Alcaraz-Sanchez, 2023)</ref>. From this perspective, the present dataset presents an unprecedented opportunity to investigate one potential candidate of MPE-like states as realized in deconstructive meditative practices <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Dahl et al., 2015)</ref>. Importantly, this dataset holds several unique advantages. First, in-depth phenomenology was systematically captured and clustered into dimensions that could be quantified across individuals. This combination of qualitative depth and quantitative structure provides an unusually rich account of altered self-experience. Second, the contrast to an active-control meditative state identification of specific phenomenological features and neural dynamics that are unique to SB-dissolution beyond global effects of meditation. Third, both the usage of active-control SB maintenance and the varying degrees of success in SB-dissolution achieved by participants, allow us to approximate a trajectory of phenomenal and neural processes towards full-fledged SB-dissolution.</p><p>Previous confirmatory analysis of our neurophenomenological MEG dataset has linked the suspension of the minimal self to reduction in high-beta power in the posterior-medial cortex, and most prominently at the peak frequency of 27 Hz in bilateral posterior cingulate and precuneus areas <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(Trautwein et al., 2024)</ref>. These results replicated findings from proof-of-concept study and a case study informing it <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Dor-Ziderman et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">2016, respectively)</ref> and provided robust evidence supporting both the feasibility of studying such deep meditative states through neurophenomenology. However, spectral power alone lacks explanatory power for a mechanistic interpretation of such states that aims to relate neural dynamics to computational models. Therefore, here we present an extended analysis of the same neurophenomenological MEG dataset that includes various complexity measures. The use of measures inspired by complexity science and information theory in neuroscience has been gaining increasing traction in recent years, and converging evidence suggests an opportunity for characterizing global states of consciousness beyond traditional approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Sarasso et al., 2021)</ref>. Our analyses focus on complementary metrics for assessing the complexity of neural activity. <ref type="bibr">Lempel-Ziv complexity (LZc;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Lempel &amp; Ziv, 1976)</ref> and Complexity via State-Space Entropy Rate (CSER; <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Mediano et al., 2023)</ref> both estimate the entropy rate of neural activity within single regions, while Transfer Entropy (TE; <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Schreiber, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Bossomaier et al., 2016)</ref> estimates directed information transfer between regions. LZc and CSER can be taken as proxies for the differentiation of neural activity, and TE as a proxy for integration <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Mediano et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Sarasso et al., 2021)</ref>. Integration and differentiation of neural activity are important organizing principles in the neuroscience of consciousness <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Tononi et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Tononi &amp; Edelman, 1998)</ref>, and a systematic exploration of the balance between them in various altered states, and specifically in MPE-like states holds promise for advancing our understanding of consciousness <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Mediano et al., 2022)</ref>. A growing body of research suggests that in meditative states entropy tends to increase globally compared to rest (recently reviewed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Atad et al., 2025)</ref>, yet most studies lack nuance that could be derived from a spectral decomposition of entropy rate as possible in CSER, and from source-localized MEG data. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, directed information transfer has received very limited attention in meditation studies, therefore the application of TE here introduces a novelty in the field. Finally, the use of complexity measures, as applied here, hold potential for validating predictions of novel formal computational phenomenology models, which attempt to draw mechanistic links between phenomenology and physiological measurements <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Lutz et al., 2025</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">, Ramstead et al., 2022)</ref>.</p><p>In sum, we address two main questions in the current analysis: How meditative states affect neural information dynamics, and whether self-dissolution phenomenology can be explained by such metrics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Materials and Methods</head><p>We re-analyzed a neuro-phenomenological dataset consisting of magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings and phenomenological interviews previously collected in our lab. In section 2.1 we briefly describe the experimental setup, data collection and cleaning conducted in the previous study, for a full description see <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Nave et al. (2021)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Trautwein et al. (2024)</ref>. In sections 2.2-2.4 we describe the methods applied in the current study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Data Acquisition</head><p>Participants: N=46 meditation practitioners (aged 26-72, mean age = 39.8 ± 10.9, 27 males and 19 females) with a wide range of meditation experience <ref type="bibr">(115-24,837 hours, mean = 3,832 ± 4,845 hours)</ref> in mindful awareness and insight (vipassana) practice. Participants were selected to represent a wide variety in expertise levels to allow the detection of expertise-dependent effects. Inclusion criteria were the attendance of at least one meditation retreat and a minimum of one year of practice. Exclusion criteria were current psychiatric disorders or medication, conditions that limit MEG data quality, and not having normal or corrected-to-normal vision or hearing. During preprocessing of the MEG data, one participant was excluded due to large artifacts, resulting in a sample size of N = 45. All participants had participated in a preparatory 3-week meditation training program designed to explore more directly the sense of self-boundary and its dissolution.</p><p>MEG recordings: Conducted in the supine position using a whole-head 248-channel magnetometer array (4-D Neuroimaging, Magnes 3600 WH) with a sampling rate of 1017.25 Hz and an online 1-400 Hz band-pass filter in a magnetically-shielded room. Environmental noise was removed by reference coils, and head shape and coil position were digitized. MEG data cleaning involved removal of artifacts caused by heartbeats (corrected via electrocardiogram estimate based on the MEG average), power line frequency (corrected via recording on an extra channel) and building vibrations (corrected via recordings from accelerometers on the MEG gantry). Furthermore, two sensors showed excessive noise across recording sessions and were therefore removed from all recordings. Movement and jump artifacts were removed by visual inspection and Independent Component Analysis.</p><p>Experimental procedure: During MEG acquisition, participants were asked to alternate between a non-meditative resting state in which they let their minds wander freely, a state of self-boundary dissolution (SB-) in which they were asked to meditate while dissolving their sense of self-boundary, and a state of self-boundary maintenance (SB+) in which they were asked to meditate while maintaining a clear sense of their self boundaries. The procedure involved two experimental blocks (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>) which included a 100-seconds resting state followed by 5 repetitions of 60-seconds meditation epochs, alternating between meditative states of SB+ or SB-. The order of SB+ and SBwas counterbalanced, so that half of the participants started with SB+ in the first block and with SBin the second block and vice versa for the second half of the cohort. After each block participants were asked to rate the depth and stability of each meditative epoch (on a scale of 1-3). Following the two blocks, an additional 100-seconds resting state was recorded. Self-ratings indicated that, overall, participants felt successful in dissolving and maintaining the SB during MEG assessments (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>, for an analysis of depth and stability ratings see <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Trautwein et al., 2024)</ref>. Together with the phenomenological data, these results confirm, on an experiential level, the successful induction of meditation-based SB-dissolution in the lab, subsuming several core features of the minimal self.</p><p>Phenomenological interviews and analysis: directly after the MEG session, semi-structured interviews inspired by the micro-phenomenological method <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Petitmengin, 2006)</ref> were conducted to describe the actual experience of meditation-based self-boundary dissolution (SB-) and maintenance (SB+). Based on the interviews, six phenomenological dimensions were derived -sense of agency, self-location, first-person perspective (FPP), attentional disposition, body sensations and affective valence with three to four subcategories for each dimension (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Nave et al., 2021)</ref>. Two independent raters coded each dimension, and a quantitative depth of dissolution score (Dissolution Depth Calculated, DDC) was derived for each participant based on the semantic order of the subcategories and their cross-correlation. Specifically, DDC was defined as the weighted sum of all the phenomenological dimensions excluding affective valence (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Trautwein et al., 2024)</ref>. Furthermore, scores on three dimensions corresponding to core facets of the minimal self-agency, FPP, and self-location <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Blanke and Metzinger, 2009)</ref>-were used to select a subgroup of "full dissolvers" (N = 12) that included only participants having the highest rating on at least one dimension and the second highest rating on the remaining dimensions during self-boundary dissolution (SB-) state (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>).

As a relatively new measure, CSER has not yet been widely validated, but initial evidence demonstrates that indeed broadband CSER mirrors well-established effects seen in broadband LZc for various conscious states, while spectrally decomposed CSER shows more nuanced results for different frequency bands.

Under the assumption of Gaussian innovations, the CSER estimate of entropy rate can be computed directly using the standard formula for the differential entropy of a multivariate Gaussian distribution (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Mediano et al., 2023</ref> for a full description).

Given that condition comparison results for LZc and CSER were highly similar, LZc was used as a representative measure for the correlation analysis (see Results). For LZc, correlation was tested via whole-brain nonparametric cluster-based randomization tests implemented using the FieldTrip ft_statfun_correlationT statistic, which computes voxel-wise Pearson correlations, and assesses cluster-level significance using the Monte Carlo method.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Meditation increases global differentiation and integration of neural activity</head><p>Whole-group within-subject comparison of the conditions revealed that meditative states are characterized by a strong global increase in entropy rate compared to rest. Both LZc and CSER of broadband neural activity show increases (p&lt;0.001, after cluster-based correction) in widespread posterior and medial cortical regions (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, columns 1 &amp; 2). This finding is in line with accumulating evidence that meditative states are characterized by increased neural complexity compared to resting state (reviewed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Atad et al., 2025)</ref>. However, these metrics failed to clearly differentiate between the meditative states of self-boundary dissolution (SB-) and maintenance (SB+), with only a small significant cluster for LZc in the temporal cortex (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> column 3), although a descriptive trend of increased entropy rate in SB-emerges (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref>). Furthermore, the between-subjects comparison did not yield significant differences between the sub-groups (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref>).</p><p>As expected, LZc and CSER showed almost identical results. This finding adds valuable empirical support for the theoretical similarity between both metrics <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Mediano et al., 2023)</ref>. Since LZc and CSER are both estimators of the entropy rate of neural activity and can thus be seen as a proxy for differentiation of neural activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Mediano et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Sarasso et al., 2021)</ref>, these findings provide convergent evidence that meditation increases global differentiation of neural activity, although broadband entropy rate alone cannot discriminate between self-boundary dissolution and maintenance. Nonetheless, it remains possible that nuanced changes in entropy are accurate predictors of individual phenomenology -as shown in sections 3.2 and 3.3. For information transfer our results show that, compared to rest, meditative states were characterized by increased information transfer for the between-ROIs pairwise-conditional (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>) and within-ROIs global-conditional (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>, top row in each heatmap) analyses. Increases in SB+ vs. rest were more pronounced than SB-, with significant increase in TE primarily from the occipital cortex. Group comparisons show a trend of slightly increased information transfer in SB-for the full dissolvers, from all ROIs excluding the occipital cortex, in which there is a clear trend of decrease (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2</ref>).</p><p>Within-ROIs pairwise-conditional analysis (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3</ref>) yielded mostly mixed results, however a strong differentiation between SB-and SB+ emerges in a specific pattern of reduced information transfer from the anterior cingulate to mid-and post-cingulate (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>). Interestingly, the between-subjects comparison reveals that in SB+ Vs. Rest the full dissolvers group show the same pattern of reduced anterior cingulate compared to the rest of the group (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S4</ref>), indicating perhaps that skillful meditators employ these reductions in meditation generally while others do so only in deeper meditative states.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Directionality of condition differences is frequency-dependent for entropy rate but not for information transfer</head><p>As previously mentioned, TE and CSER allow for a principled decomposition into individual frequency components. To assess whether the observed overall effects are frequency-dependent, we decomposed broadband TE and CSER into canonical frequency bands (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">S1</ref>). Spectral decomposition reveals that both broadband TE and CSER effects are mainly driven by high-frequency bands of low and high gamma (Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>,<ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>). Interestingly, although all spectral components change in the same direction for TE (Figs. 6, S5), the results for CSER are nuanced: not only the magnitude of contribution to the total effects, but also the directionality of changes in entropy rate between experimental conditions is frequency-dependent (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>). Compared to rest, meditative states exhibit increases in entropy rate in low frequencies (delta, theta bands) and high frequencies (low and high gamma bands), while for alpha and low beta bands entropy rate is lower in meditative state than rest and the high beta band exhibits mixed effects (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>, bottom panel). Furthermore, the spectral decomposition reveals differences between the meditative conditions not captured by broadband entropy rate-namely slight increases in CSER in SB-Vs. SB+, mainly in sensorimotor areas, in theta and high gamma bands, and robust decreases in SB-Vs. SB+ in sensorimotor and posterior-medial cortices for high beta (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>, bottom panel). Interestingly, the decreases in CSER in high beta are almost identical in spatial location to the whole-group effect of high beta spectral power decreases in previous analysis (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3</ref> in <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Trautwein et al., 2024)</ref>.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Neural correlates of self-dissolution phenomenology</head><p>So far, we have found that entropy and information transfer reflect global changes in neural dynamics in meditation compared to rest, yet don't clearly discriminate between the meditative states (SB+ and SB-), questioning their usefulness for understanding self-dissolution phenomenology or MPE-like states. Next, we show that this is not the case-via employing neurophenomenology, it becomes evident that nuanced changes in entropy rate and information transfer are good predictors of self-dissolution phenomenology at the individual level. Whole-group correlations (N=44, see methods) of neural measures with dissolution phenomenology show that a decrease in LZc in orbitofrontal cortex between SB-and SB+ (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7 A-C</ref>) is strongly correlated with DDC, (r = -0.57, p = 0.0304, cluster-corrected, q = 0.0456, cluster-and FDR-corrected). Furthermore, decreases in TE from the cingulate, occipital, limbic and subcortical areas between SB-and SB+ (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7 D-F</ref>) strongly correlate with DDC (r = -0.50, p = 0.0098, NBS-corrected, q = 0.0294, NBS-and FDR-corrected). Importantly, these strong neural correlates, showing specific decreases in SB-Vs. SB+, should be understood in the context of the global increases seen in the rest of the brain in the meditative states compared to rest. While meditation induces global increases in differentiation and integration, participants who reached full-fledged SB-dissolution showed a nuanced pattern of decreases in these areas while in less skillful participants, these areas followed the general pattern of global increases (see barplots-Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7 C</ref>,<ref type="figure">F</ref>).</p><p>Given the positive results of these univariate predictors, we next ask whether the combination of these neural correlates predicts dissolution phenomenology over and above each of the correlates separately.</p><p>To answer this question, we fitted a multiple linear regression model predicting dissolution scores from neural differences between SB-and SB+ meditation conditions from the individually predictive regions found here (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref> A-F), alongside the pre-computed neural correlate of high-beta reductions in posterior-medial cortex (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref> G-I, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Trautwein et al., 2024</ref> for the original presentation). Indeed, our combined model reaches exceptionally strong predictive power, explaining above 52% of the variance in dissolution scores with an average prediction error of 0.195 on a 0-1 scale (R² = 0.523, RMSE = 0.195) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7J</ref>, Table <ref type="table">S3</ref>). When comparing the full model against all reduced subsets (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>), the full model explained significantly more variance than any single or two-predictor model (ΔR² = 0.093-0.406, all FDR-corrected p ≤ 0.008). This indicates a synergistic effect, in which reductions of high-beta in posterior-medial cortex, orbitofrontal cortex LZc reductions, and reductions in TE from the cingulate, occipital, limbic and subcortical areas, jointly predict dissolution phenomenology. Notice that the linear model takes each predictor with a minus sign and therefore the slope of the regression line is positive. The correlation value (r), equivalent to the square root of R², is also reported for consistency with previous correlation plots.</p><p>The regression line is plotted in black with 95% confidence interval in gray. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p>Capitalizing on a unique large-scale neurophenomenological dataset, we asked how different meditative states affect the information dynamics of neural activity and if observed changes can explain self-boundary (SB) dissolution phenomenology. We build on thick phenomenological <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Berkovich-Ohana et al., 2020)</ref> data and on an active-control meditation condition to pinpoint neural changes specifically associated with SB-dissolution. Since attenuation of the self construct is a central aspect of MPE-like states, our findings provide insights into the neural dynamics underlying such profound alterations in consciousness. Our comprehensive analysis reveals that meditative SB-dissolution involves a complex interplay of global neural changes and selective regional modulations. Alongside previously established reductions in spectral power in most bands, and most prominently in high-beta in the posterior-medial cortex <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(Trautwein et al., 2024)</ref>, neural complexity measures illustrate an intriguing pattern of changes. While meditation generally increases both broadband neural entropy rate and directed information transfer, deeper SB-dissolution states are mainly characterized by further specific patterns of reduction. These specific reductions include reduced broadband information transfer from the anterior to the mid-and post-cingulate cortex, reduced sensorimotor and posterior-medial high-beta entropy rate, reduced broadband information transfer from cingulate, limbic, occipital and subcortical areas, and reduced broadband entropy rate in the orbitofrontal cortex. The specific broadband reductions in information transfer and entropy correlate strongly with dissolution phenomenology (r = -0.5, r = -0.57, respectively), and when combined with the previously established correlate of reductions in posterior-medial high beta power in a multiple linear regression, produce an unprecedented synergistic prediction of MPE-like phenomenology (R² = 0.52), which demonstrates the multi-faceted nature of self-dissolution and establishes a uniquely powerful neurophenomenological association.</p><p>Following, we discuss the global effects of meditation on neural complexity, emphasizing the novelty of our findings in information transfer (section 4.1); we then examine the neural correlates of self-boundary dissolution, detailing how our neurophenomenological analysis identified specific neural signatures that differentiate these states (section 4.2); finally, we consider the implications of our results for computational phenomenology and active inference accounts of minimal phenomenal experience and deep meditative states (section 4.3), concluding with limitations and future directions (section 4.4).</p></div>

Increases in entropy rate in meditative states are aligned with a growing body of literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Atad et al., 2025)</ref> reporting a similar trend. Spectral decomposition reveals that entropy rate effects are strongly driven by high-frequency activity (low and high gamma bands, 30-100 Hz).

Entropy rate in low-frequency (delta, theta) and high-frequency bands (low and high gamma) is higher in meditative states compared to rest, while middle-range frequency bands (alpha, low beta) show decreases or mixed effects (high beta). This frequency-specific pattern provides important refinement to the common treatment of broadband entropy rate as a unitary phenomenon in consciousness research.</p><p>Our findings on increased information transfer in meditation represent a novel contribution to the field, as directed information transfer during meditative states has received limited empirical attention. These results align with and add nuance to more established findings of increased global integration as shown in various non-directed connectivity measures <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Tripathi et al., 2025;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">van Lutterveld et al., 2017)</ref>. Interestingly, unlike the similarity of entropy rate increases in both meditative and psychedelic states <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Atad et al., 2025)</ref>, our results of increased information transfer show an opposite effect compared to psychedelics, where information transfer is reduced in comparison to placebo <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Barnett et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Rajpal et al., 2022)</ref>. This divergence offers a unique opportunity to differentiate between these two prominent altered states of consciousness on a mechanistic level, as elaborated in section 4.3.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Neural correlates of self-boundary dissolution in meditation</head><p>While global effects failed to distinguish between self-boundary dissolution (SB-) and maintenance (SB+) conditions, our neurophenomenological analysis revealed specific neural signatures that differentiate these states, alongside specific neural correlates of dissolution phenomenology.</p><p>First, the group level effects significantly differentiating SB-from SB+ include reduced high-beta entropy rate in posterior-medial and sensorimotor cortices, alongside slight increases in high-gamma entropy rate in sensorimotor cortex. Interestingly, the spatial distribution of high-beta entropy rate reductions closely mirrors the whole-group effects of high-beta spectral power reductions previously reported in this dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(Trautwein et al., 2024)</ref>, demonstrating convergence between spectral power and complexity measures. This convergence strengthens the interpretation that high-beta oscillations in posterior-medial cortex represent a fundamental neural signature of the minimal self, consistent with work linking beta oscillations to the maintenance of top-down predictions precision estimates and gamma oscillations to the bottom-up signaling of prediction error <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Bastos et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Bauer et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Friston et al., 2015)</ref>. In line with this, increased high-gamma entropy rate in the sensorimotor cortex may reflect an increase in prediction error rate of sensory stimuli, when not suppressed by body related predictions.</p><p>Second, on the group level, reduced broadband information transfer from the anterior cingulate to mid-and post cingulate significantly differentiated SB-from SB+. The anterior cingulate cortex plays central roles in cognitive control, conflict monitoring, and self-referential processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Bush et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Northoff &amp; Bermpohl, 2004)</ref>, making its reduced influence during self-dissolution theoretically coherent, and reflective of the observed phenomenology of "letting go" <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Nave et al., 2021)</ref>. This finding suggests that the suspension of self-boundaries may involve a relaxation of top-down control mechanisms originating from regions critical for maintaining coherent self-representation, and a relaxation of cognitive control. This is aligned with the hypofrontality theory, which proposes that many altered states of consciousness arise from reduced activity in frontal brain regions, especially the prefrontal cortex, diminishing top-down control and self-referential processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Dietrich, 2003)</ref>.</p><p>The finding regarding a similar pattern for SB+ in the full dissolvers, suggests that skillful meditators already employ this relaxation in more general forms of meditation, while the others rely on this mechanism for the transition to self-dissolution meditation. As broadband TE effects are strongly driven by gamma-band activity which is related to bottom-up signaling of prediction error <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Bastos et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Bauer et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Friston et al., 2015)</ref>, one mechanism of SB-dissolution -compared to the control meditative state -may be a reduction in information transfer of prediction errors from anterior to posterior cingulate regions.</p><p>Third, when incorporating of interindividual differences in phenomenology into the analysis, a strong differentiation becomes evident, where alongside global increases in entropy rate and information transfer in the meditative states, a relative reduction of specific neural features strongly correlates with dissolution phenomenology (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref>). The correlation between relative reduction of entropy rate in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and dissolution depth provides novel insights into the neural mechanisms of self-boundary dissolution. The OFC is classically associated with valuation, reward processing, and flexible updating of stimulus-outcome associations <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Rolls, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Kringelbach &amp; Rolls, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Rushworth et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Wallis, 2007)</ref> and representation of self-referential stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Northoff &amp; Bermpohl, 2004)</ref>. More recently, the OFC has been framed within predictive coding accounts as a hub for generating and updating predictions about the affective and motivational significance of sensory inputs <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Barrett &amp; Simmons, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Wilson et al., 2014)</ref>. Our finding that entropy rate in the OFC is reduced during successful dissolution compared to the active control meditation thus suggests that there might also be a subtle affective component in SB-dissolution, and specifically, that the suspension of self-evidencing loops and rushing prediction errors does not lead to updating of affective-motivational predictions in these practitioners. Based on the previously reported association between lifetime meditation practice and dissolution depth <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Nave et al., 2021)</ref>, it can be speculated that this is due to a higher familiarity with (and acceptance) of the related neural state-space. While positive affective valence during SB-was not related with phenomenological dissolution depth, it has been related to enhanced self-death acceptance <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Dor-Ziderman et al., 2025)</ref>. Future studies might zoom into the putatively more fine-grained affective meaning of these effects.</p><p>Similarly, while information transfer in meditative states generally increases, a reduction of information transfer from occipital, cingulate, limbic and subcortical areas strongly correlates with SB-dissolution phenomenology. The reduction of information transfer from the occipital cortex thus possibly relates to decreased emphasis on visual processing and external sensory engagement. The relative reduction of information transfer from cingulate, limbic and subcortical areas during SBmight suggest a gating of bodily signals from deeper brain regions, previously related to phenomenologically reduced sense of time and space <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Berkovich-Ohana et al., 2013)</ref>.</p><p>Finally, we have shown that when taken together, the neural correlates we have found in addition to reduction in posterior-medial cortex high-beta power found in the previous study, yielded a remarkably strong predictive model, explaining over half the variance in phenomenological dissolution scores. This uniquely powerful effect, alongside the significant contributions of each of the three neural correlates to the predictive model, suggest that self-boundary dissolution is a synergistic phenomenon reflected across multiple scales and aspects of neural dynamics. This multi-faceted neural signature aligns with phenomenological accounts of self-dissolution as an emergent property arising from the dynamic interplay of distributed processes <ref type="bibr">(Berkovich-Ohana et al., 2024)</ref>, rather than being localized to specific brain regions <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Giommi et al., 2023)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Implications for computational phenomenology and active inference accounts of MPE and deep meditative states</head><p>Our findings have important implications for computational phenomenology and active inference accounts of deep meditative states, particularly with regard to how self-boundary (SB) dissolution can be understood as a reconfiguration of precision-weighted priors and prediction error signaling. Several recent accounts converge on a framing of progressively deep meditative states as involving a loosening of top-down constraints, reflected in the progressive reduction of prior precisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Laukkonen &amp; Slagter, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Mago et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Pagnoni, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Prest &amp; Berryman, 2024</ref><ref type="bibr">, reviewed in Tal et al., 2025)</ref>. In predictive coding terms, reducing prior precision makes top-down predictions less dominant in shaping perception; when priors lose precision, the brain treats them as less reliable, so bottom-up sensory evidence (prediction error) gains more influence on updating the generative model. Crucially, the observation that global increases in complexity accompany meditation in general, but that selective reductions in entropy and information transfer specifically track SB-dissolution, provides a mechanistically precise way to test active inference accounts: it shows how meditation can simultaneously enhance the richness of neural dynamics while locally suspending information flow that sustains the self-model. Recent advances in neurophenomenology further suggest that phenomenological categories can be formulated within computational models such as the active inference framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Ramstead et al., 2022)</ref>. Such approaches provide a formalized bridge between phenomenal and neural domains <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Lutz et al., 2025)</ref> and have specifically been applied to advanced meditative states, including pure awareness or MPE states <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Mago et al., 2024</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">, Sandved-Smith, 2024)</ref>.</p><p>Our results contribute to this endeavor by demonstrating how global and selective neural complexity modulations jointly map onto the phenomenology of SB-dissolution, offering a refined computational account of how the predictive mind reorganizes in profound meditative states.</p><p>Our findings of global increases in entropy rate generally validate accounts of reduced top-down control <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Laukkonen &amp; Slagter, 2021</ref>), yet add nuance to these. Importantly, however, they challenge predictions that deep meditative states entail a global increase in entropy <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Mago et al., 2024)</ref>. Mago and colleagues argue that MPE states arise when precision weighting is shifted toward lower levels of a hierarchical inference system, producing a perceptual state with increased entropy and reduced complexity. Instead, we show that dissolution is characterized by specific reductions in entropy and information transfer against a globally elevated baseline-suggesting a more nuanced process of selective suppression rather than uniform "entropy maximization." Our results thus call for a refinement of the hypothesis of a global "flattening" of predictive hierarchies <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Laukkonen &amp; Slagter, 2021)</ref> suggesting that this "flattening" occurs across some phenomenal dimensions, that are reflected in specific neural circuits.</p><p>Reduced information transfer from the anterior to mid-and posterior cingulate explicitly supports predictions from computational phenomenology regarding the neural mechanism of effortlessness in MPE (Sandved-Smith, 2024), and aligns with phenomenological reports of "letting go" in dissolution <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Metzinger, 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Nave, 2021)</ref>. Taken together, these results suggest that the suspension of self-boundaries is not simply an entropic expansion but involves finely tuned reconfigurations of precision-weighting across hierarchies.</p><p>In addition, our results offer a unique opportunity to differentiate between deep meditative states and psychedelics on a mechanistic level, despite both being associated with SB-dissolution phenomenologically <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Letheby &amp; Gerrans, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Milliere et al., 2018)</ref>. The Relaxed Beliefs Under Psychedelics framework <ref type="bibr">(REBUS, Carhart-Harris &amp; Friston, 2019)</ref> proposes that psychedelics reduce the precision of high-level priors, allowing a flood of bottom-up prediction errors that destabilize the self-model and open perception to novel interpretations. Meditation accounts <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Laukkonen &amp; Slagter, 2021)</ref> suggest a gradual attenuation of predictive hierarchies. Our result of increased global information transfer in meditation alongside specific reductions as opposed to the global reductions seen in psychedelics, together with the similarity of increased global entropy rate support an interpretation may suggest that while both involve self-boundary dissolution through altered precision weighting, psychedelics increase perceptual diversity and entropy, whereas meditation drives dynamics toward simplicity and stability.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Limitations and future directions</head><p>While our study leverages a unique large-scale neurophenomenological MEG dataset, several limitations should be noted. First, our analyses are correlational, so causal inferences about the role of specific neural dynamics in self-boundary dissolution remain tentative. Second, although our dataset includes an active-control meditation condition, the generalizability of findings to other meditation traditions, levels of expertise, or non-meditative MPE states remains to be established. Third, while MEG provides excellent temporal resolution, localization of deep or subcortical sources is still limited, and complementary imaging modalities (e.g., fMRI) could further clarify subcortical contributions. Future work could integrate computational modeling to explicitly link observed entropy and information transfer patterns to manipulations of prior precision and prediction error within hierarchical generative models, providing a stronger test of active inference accounts. Longitudinal designs tracking the acquisition of meditative skill would clarify how the observed neural patterns evolve with practice, and experimental manipulations, such as targeted perturbations of network activity or neurofeedback, could probe the causal role of specific hubs (e.g., anterior/posterior cingulate, OFC) in SB-dissolution. Finally, extending these analyses to compare meditation and psychedelics under controlled conditions would illuminate mechanistic similarities and divergences between distinct routes to self-boundary dissolution. Collectively, these directions offer a roadmap for refining mechanistic accounts of deep meditative states and their neural signatures.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusion</head><p>Our comprehensive analysis reveals that meditative self-boundary dissolution involves a complex interplay of global neural changes and selective regional modulations. While meditation generally increases both neural complexity and information transfer, deeper dissolution states are characterized by nuanced patterns of reduction. The synergistic prediction of phenomenology by multiple neural measures (R² = 0.52) demonstrates the multi-faceted nature of self-dissolution. Importantly, these results establish a uniquely powerful neurophenomenological association, highlighting the power of using neurophenomenology when studying subtle states of consciousness and selfhood <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">(Varela et al., 1991)</ref>. These findings advance our understanding of how the brain constructs and, vice versa, can suspend the minimal sense of self, providing empirical constraints for computational models of consciousness and offering insights into the neural basis of deep meditative and MPE-like states.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
