<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The global export of Western psychology combined with legacies of White supremacy and colonialism have marginalized racial and ethnic minority and indigenous (REMI) mental health providers, to the detriment of the field. We conducted a scoping review to 1) examine the representation of REMI mental health professionals in the published English-language literature through 2019, and 2) provide a narrative review of their training and practice experiences, needs and insights regarding mental health services. We searched PsycINFO-OVID, Medline-PubMed, and CINAHL-EBSCO databases for English-language records through 2019 related to REMI mental health professionals across disciplines.</p><p>Characteristics of the provider (ethnoracial identity, discipline, country of practice) and the research report (type, method, outlet) were analyzed. Moreover, we conducted a narrative review of key themes and trends by decade. Only 860 reports met inclusion criteria over more than six decades. Most were conducted in the U.S., and the representation of Black, Asian, and Latinx providers mirrored growth in the U.S. population over time. However, indigenous clinicians and those of Arab, Middle Eastern or North African heritage were highly underrepresented. Challenges faced by REMI clinicians-structural racism, race-related stress, cultural conflicts, and pressures to assimilate to Western values-produced a sense of internalized inferiority and cultural dislocation from the healing wisdom of the Global Majority. We recommend that critical consciousness and a global competence perspective guide curricular changes to meet the education and training needs of REMI clinicians in a globalizing world.</p></div>

Fortunately, the tide is shifting. Global Majority scholars and their allies are increasingly calling for decolonizing and anti-oppressive models of research, training, and practice to advance a more critically informed knowledge base to promote mental health equity <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Adames et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Buchanan et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">French et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Outsider status offers a powerful vantage point from which to appraise the strengths and 1 Internationally, the most disadvantaged REMIs in most multicultural societies tend to be people who are non-White. Different terms are used in different contexts to refer to these groups, including 'people of color' and 'BIPOC (Black, Indigenous and People of Color) in the United States, and 'BAME' (Black, Asian, Minority Ethnic) in the United Kingdom. More recently, the term 'People of the Global Majority' is increasingly being adopted to challenge the idea of whiteness as the "norm", and more accurately describe the Black, Brown, Indigenous, and Asian individuals who collectively represent more than 80% of the world's population. In this article, we retain the term REMI to reflect our focus on the effects of minoritized status and racialization within mental health training, education, and practice contexts largely in the Global North, including the ways that such groups navigate oppressive environments to deliver mental health services, especially to REM clients and communities.</p><p>weaknesses of prevailing models of care. Tinsely- <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Jones (2001)</ref> wrote more than 20 years ago, "As bicultural representatives, psychologists of color have unique perspectives that can substantively inform psychological theory and practice, as well as enrich the field in general... It is at these overlapping margins of cultures traversed by psychologists of color that new dialogue and creative solutions can be born. <ref type="bibr">" (p. 575)</ref>. Finally, perhaps because of their first-hand experiences of structural disadvantage, REMI practitioners express a stronger commitment to serve those most marginalized in society <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Limb &amp; Organista, 2003)</ref>. As such, the values and perspectives of REMI practitioners may provide a necessary corrective to the cultural and structural biases that infuse the mental health field.</p><p>This study seeks to address the invisibility and marginalization of REMI mental health professionals' perspectives in education, training, and practice by conducting a scoping review of the global English-language literature published through 2019. We examined published records that included REMI providers of mental health and related services, such as counseling, psychotherapy, psychoanalysis, psychiatry, social work, indigenous healing practices, and other mental health supports whether delivered in institutional (e.g., clinics, schools) or community settings (e.g., churches, reservations). We identified studies in which REMI providers were included as participants or interventionists, in first-person accounts and case studies, and as stimuli in experimental studies. While acknowledging that local sociopolitical contexts and history produce unique dynamics of power and privilege that affect Global Majority providers across practice settings, research suggest that there are common impacts of marginalization, oppression, and colonization that connect experiences of mental health professionals identifying as Black, indigenous or other people of color (BIPOC) in the United States (Goode-Cross &amp; Grim, 2016), with Aboriginal cognitive-behavioral counselors in Australia <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Bennett-levy et al., 2014)</ref>, South Asian social workers in the United Kingdom <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">(Willis et al., 2017)</ref>, Hindu psychologists in South Africa <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Padayachee &amp; Laher, 2014)</ref>, and immigrant clinicians in Sweden <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Eliassi, 2017)</ref> and Canada <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Salami et al., 2019)</ref>.</p><p>Common experiences of REMI mental health professionals across country contexts include minority stress, internalized oppression, and experiences of systemic racism and marginalization in their educational and work settings <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Casas et al., 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Hendriks &amp; van Ewijk, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Ramon, 2004)</ref>. REMI providers also share common sources of resilience and strength, including cultural values, community supports, and engagement in collective action <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Bell-Tolliver &amp; Wilkerson, 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Given these shared experiences, we examined all English-language records pertaining to REMI providers of mental health services who were minorities in their country of practice (e.g., Chinese social workers in the U.S. but not in China), with the addition of non-White practitioners in South Africa given its legacy of apartheid and ongoing racial inequality <ref type="bibr">(Kometsi, 2008)</ref>. While we seek to examine experiences of REMI providers across diverse contexts, the small number of articles from the Global South and restriction to English-language records are key limitations of this review. Two questions were explored: 1) How have REMI mental health providers been represented in the literature (e.g., growth over time, methodologies, research topics), and 2) What are their training and practice experiences, needs, and insights regarding inclusive mental health practice? Results are used to inform recommendations for revising and expanding the curriculum to foster more inclusive, anti-oppressive, and culturally-centered approaches to mental health training, education, and practice.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head><p>In contrast to systematic reviews, scoping reviews seek to describe the existing literature base and range of evidence available and to represent this evidence by mapping or charting the data without formally assessing the quality of the evidence. Guided by <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Arksey and O'Malley's (2005)</ref> five-step process for conducting scoping reviews and <ref type="bibr">Levac et al.'s (2010)</ref> enhancements, we articulated the two broad research questions presented above (Step 1). For Steps 2 (Identifying relevant studies) and 3 (Study selection), we began by operationalizing our core constructs. Preliminary searches revealed inconsistent indexing of subject terms related to "racial or ethnic minority", "indigenous", and "mental health provider" across research databases over time. In the 1960s for example, the term 'Negro' was used to describe Black Americans, replaced in the 1970s by the term "Black". Consulting with research librarians, we developed a list of maximally inclusive search terms to identify studies that included REMI providers, even if not the focus. To counter biases in search terms related to the mental health professions' global colonial history, we also developed a list of terms to identify providers of indigenous and community mental health care delivered outside the disciplines of psychology, social work, and psychiatry.</p><p>Steps 4 (Charting the data) and 5 (Collating, summarizing, and reporting results) involved an iterative process of refining the data to be be extracted, updating the data-charting form, and recoding as needed. Study themes were qualitatively analyzed by decade <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Levac et al., 2010)</ref>. While this study was not preregistered, it complies with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">(Tricco et al., 2018)</ref> Database searches were conducted in PsycINFO-OVID, Medline-PubMed (using MeSH terms), and CINAHL-EBSCO Host in 2016 and updated in the winter of 2019. Search terms included 25 synonyms for mental health providers such as "mental health professional", "psychiatrist", "psychologist", "case managers", "community health workers", "social workers", "clinicians", "counselors", and "therapist", cross-referenced with 87 terms related to race, ethnicity, culture, and immigration 2 .</p><p>The core research team consisted of a racially diverse group of 5 graduate students and a faculty member in psychology, and an evolving team of 12 undergraduate and master students. Search results were imported to the Covidence software package. Titles and abstracts were screened by at least two members; disagreements were resolved by two additional members. Reports that passed the initial screening proceeded to full-text review by two coders using the Zotero reference management software.</p><p>Disagreements were resolved in consultation with the full team.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Extraction, Charting, and Synthesis of Results</head><p>For each report, data extracted included: a) Authors and publication year; b) Source; c) Country; d) REMI heritage(s) of the provider sample; e) Provider type (e.g., psychologist); e) Study type (e.g., 2 Culture; acculturation; cultural deprivation; culture diversity; culture safety; culture values; ethnic groups; <ref type="bibr">Arabs, Cambodians; Chinese; Filipinos; Hmong; Japanese; Koreans; Laotians; Thai; Vietnamese; Blacks; Gypsies; Hispanics; Indigenous people; Eskimos; Native Americans; Racism; Immigrants; Illegal; affirmative action; African culture groups; Alaskan Natives; American Indians; Asians; Client treatment groups; cross cultural collaboration, communication, counseling differences, psychology, treatment; cultural deprivation, sensitivity; disadvantaged; diversity; diversity in the workplace; ethnic identity, values; ethnocentrism; ethnology; expatriates; Hawaii Native; Immigration; Indigenous populations; international psychology, students; Inuit; Latinos/Latinas; Marginalization; Mexican Americans; Microaggressions; minority groups; multicultural counseling, education; multiculturalism; multiracial; Pacific Islander; Patient Selection; prejudice; Race and anthropological, ethnic discrimination, ethnic attitudes, ethnic differences, ethnic groups; ethnic relations; Refugees; Romanians; social discrimination, integration</ref>; sociocultural factors; South Asian cultural groups; Southeast Asian cultural groups; Transcultural psychiatry; Indians North American, Central American; Oceanic ancestry group; Jews; Roma; Race relations; continental population groups empirical, quantitative); f) Study method (e.g., survey, analogue); g) Study topic (e.g., racial/ethnic matching). Data extraction was conducted initially as a group and then in pairs, once minimum inter-rater reliability was achieved (k=.866-.952), Narrative review of the full-text articles was conducted by 3-4 team members for each decade. Articles were reviewed and coded based on research topics, themes, and trends to summarize the emerging state of knowledge regarding REMI providers over time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>The initial search yielded 29,212 reports, with another 60 located through referrals (see Suppl  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Racial/Ethnic Group Representation</head><p>As shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> and Suppl Table <ref type="table">1</ref>, Black providers and those of African descent were the most highly represented, present in 58.5% of the 860 reports (62.2% of empirical and 54.8% of non-empirical reports). In the 1960s and 1970s, very few reports included providers from other REMI backgrounds. The 1980s saw a notable increase in reports featuring Asian or Pacific Islander providers<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">3</ref> (31.5% of the total) and providers of Latinx, Hispanic, Central or South American heritage (31.5%).</p><p>Providers of native, aboriginal, First Nations, and other indigenous heritage and Arab, Middle Eastern and North African heritage were underrepresented, present in only 14.1% and 6.3% of reports, respectively. Suppl Table <ref type="table">1</ref> reports the specific ethnoracial categories represented. A close look reveals patterns of aggregation and invisibility. Although clinicians of Asian heritage are in nearly one-third of articles, they were typically described in the aggregate ("Asian"), with Southeast Asians (2.6%), Pacific Islanders (1.2%), and Filipinos (0.7%) significantly underrepresented. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mental Health Discipline/Provider Type</head><p>Suppl Table <ref type="table">2</ref> presents the training background or discipline for the REMI providers in each record. Nearly 1 in 4 records (23.02%) referred generically to REMI "therapists" or "clinicians". Of those designated by discipline, psychology was the most represented (31.16%), followed by counseling (20.47%), social work (16.51%), psychiatry (13.37%), and psychoanalysis (7.67%). Of note, 4.42% referred to REMI clinicians used as stimuli (in analogue studies) or as a response option (as in client preferences studies). Indigenous mental health care workers (1.63%) accounted for a tiny fraction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Geographic Region</head><p>The majority (n= 724, 84.2%) of articles focused on REMI providers in the U.S., with another 3.6% in Canada. Of the remaining, 41 (4.8%) articles focused on REMI providers in Europe, 23 (2.7%) in Oceania (e.g., New Zealand, Australia), 21 (2.4%) in the Middle East, 10 (1.2%) in Africa, 4 (.5%) in Asia, 1 (.1%) in Central America, 1 (.1%) in South America, and 7 (0.8%) adopting a global perspective.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Publication Outlets</head><p>Of the 860 reports, 148 (17.2%) were book chapters and 712 (82.8%) were articles published in 64 books and 248 journals (see Suppl Table <ref type="table">3</ref>). Fourteen journals published 10 or more articles featuring REMI providers (32.6% of all articles). Six of the 14 were counseling psychology journals, 3 had a multicultural focus, 2 were in social work, 2 in general psychology or psychotherapy, 1 in community mental health, and 1 in psychiatry. Journal of Counseling Psychology published the highest number (6.3% of all articles), followed by Journal of Multicultural Counseling &amp; Development (3.4%).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Narrative Review of Themes by Decade</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The 1960s</head><p>As the Vietnam War intensified, the 1960s saw the emergence of an anti-establishment counterculture, coalitional politics, and Civil Rights Movement. In 1968, the Association of Black Psychologists (ABPsi) was founded, just months after the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. The psychiatrist Alvin Poussaint condemned both psychoanalysis and psychiatry for supporting the status quo: "Finally, too many mental health workers incline to help Blacks 'adapt' and 'adjust' to their situation or otherwise attempt to 'soothe' them, at the same time that they do little to eliminate racism in our society--or even in their own hospitals and practices" <ref type="bibr">(Poussaint, 1969, p. 944)</ref>.</p><p>During this period, scholarship on REMI clinicians focused almost exclusively on Black Americans, referred to in the literature as "Negro," a term dropped from the U.S. Census in 2013. Several articles highlighted their underrepresentation in the field. One study found that from 1920 to 1966, less than 1% of doctorates issued by the top 25 U.S. psychology programs were awarded to Black individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">(Wispe et al., 1969)</ref>. Nearly half said that race had hindered their professional opportunities. Further, only 27% were members of the APA. One wrote: "I have never been active in the APA, since I have always felt it was part of the white academic club. Besides, ghetto colleges don't know what it [APA] means, and usually don't even know what psychology means" <ref type="bibr">(Wispe at al., 1960, p. 149)</ref>.</p><p>Psychoanalytic writings described race as eliciting an unconscious response in White patients, which may impede or catalyze therapy. Resistances, fantasies, and fears in response to Black therapists were attributed to unconscious associations with Blackness that include "darkness," "death," "evil", and "Satan" and "Judas" <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Curry, 1964)</ref>. Conversely, positive regard was associated with stereotypes such as the "mammy" <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Grier, 1967)</ref> and traits of "sexual potency" and "strength" <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Schachter &amp; Butts, 1968)</ref>.</p><p>A few articles examined interracial dynamics using experimental designs. In the most cited article of the 1960s, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Banks et al. (1967)</ref> found a preference for Black counselors among Black clients, while <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Womack (1967)</ref> found no racial differences in patient comfort with Black or White psychiatrists.</p><p>Critiquing Eurocentric models of care, <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Wade et al., (1969)</ref> described the Harlem Rehabilitation Center's anti-establishment approach: "There are many black people who are the Walking Dead, dead in mind and spirit. We intend to bring them back to life and give them their souls" (p. 683).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The 1970s</head><p>The 1970s continued to center Black Americans in the mental health professions, while expanding to include those from Asian, Latinx and Indigenous backgrounds. A watershed event was the publication of Dr. Joseph <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">White's (1970)</ref> article, "Towards a Black Psychology" in Ebony, in which he envisioned a field that would challenge deficit views of Black people and center a Black frame of reference. The broad radicalization of other REMI groups was evident in ethnic and coalitional organizing (e.g., the Third World Liberation Front), which led to the founding of the the National Association for Ethnic Studies in 1972. That same year, the Asian American Psychological Association was created in the San Francisco Bay Area and three years later, the Society of Indian Psychologists was formed in 1975.</p><p>The violence of the Tuskegee Syphilis Study, discovered in the early 1970s, deepened medical mistrust among Black Americans and created an ethical imperative to develop Black-centered systems of care. <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Lawrence (1972)</ref> described one program: "There is a black psychiatrist-a rather rare commodity...There are two black social workers who, although trained in white institutions, have been away long enough to now be effective with their black clients. There are a variety of staff members with anywhere from a college education to having completed third grade. But, most important, is the idea that the staff, which is 90 percent black is, for the most part, indigenous to the community" (p. 58).</p><p>Whereas professional competence was important, the credibility of Black clinicians was linked to their authentic engagement with community concerns. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Banks (1975)</ref> wrote, "..in order to authenticate his/her role as a therapist, he/ she should be actively involved in the educational, political, and cultural life of different kinds of blacks….It is not too much to ask that the therapist, in day-to-day living, keep a finger on the pulse of the several black subcultures by visiting barbershops, colleges, churches, bars, and other hangouts and meeting places of black people" (p. 471). Banks also recognized the assimilative pressures to adopt White cultural values and their potential harms: "If the Black therapist has succumbed to white cultural standards and values and becomes a caricature of white middle class respectability, he will bring into the therapeutic encounter his own biases and aspirations, which may different widely from those of his patient" (p. 471). Shared cultural values and language were also found to be critical for Asian and Hispanic immigrant clients <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Atkinson et al., 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Furlong et al., 1979</ref>). Yet the lack of REMI providers required novel solutions to meet community needs <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Lindberg &amp; Wrenn, 1972)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The 1980s</head><p>The 1980s saw modest growth in the REMI workforce but little research about issues they were facing. Only 3.1% of APA members identified as REMI, including Blacks (1.2%), Asians (1.0%), Hispanics (0.7%), and American Indians (0.2%) <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Russo et al., 1981)</ref>. Psychiatry was more diverse, with Asian and Hispanic graduates from foreign medical schools comprising 6.8% and 3.4%, respectively, of American Psychiatric Association members <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Munoz &amp; Madigan, 1986</ref>). Yet, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Casas, Furlong, and Castillo (1980)</ref> noted that "research with respect to the ethnic minority helping professional is almost totally lacking" (p. 365).</p><p>Their survey of 71 Black, Hispanic, and Asian counselors found significant stressors including a) "lack of sensitivity of the nonminority staff", b) "expectations that minority counselors can speak for and to all minority problems", and c) "lack of institutional support for minority programs" (p. 367).</p><p>Ethnic Matching and Counselor Preference, Treatment Outcome, and Clinical Judgment.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>This scoping review described the representation, experiences, and practices of REMI mental health providers in the published literature across six decades. Given our focus on English-language studies, it was not surprising that the majority were conducted in the U.S., and that growth in the representation of Black, Asian, and Latinx providers mirrored changes in the U.S. population over time.</p><p>However, the underrepresentation of indigenous clinicians and those of Arab, Middle Eastern or North African heritage remains a crucial gap that requires attention. Further, while multiracial providers were included in 7.4% of records, the samples were typically too small to permit further analysis.</p><p>Research and writings featuring REMI providers and perspectives were published primarily in books or journals in counseling psychology, multicultural psychology, and social work. Whereas one-third were quantitative studies, 18% were qualitative or mixed-methods studies, and 50% were nonempirical, reflecting the field's early-stage emphasis on exploration, description, and theory development. Very few articles were published in the flagship psychology journals, reflecting and likely contributing to the marginalization of REMI provider issues and concerns in the field. health practice (although the terminology varied) appeared as early as the 1960s. However, these early writings have been rarely cited, leaving subsequent generations of REMI researchers and providers to re-discover these ideas on their own. Qualitative reports show that these insights are often born out of traumatic interactions with insensitive professors, supervisors, colleagues and clients. They arise out of quiet reflection, through conversations with mentors and chance encounters with research and writings by radical scholars and healers. Those who were able to record these learnings have allowed us to see the connections between our past, our present, and our future. They have laid the foundation for a new curriculum and training approach that integrates these perspectives, bringing them from the margins to the center, to bring our fields of practice into better alignment with social justice values and ethics.</p><p>As this scoping review demonstrates, the challenges faced by REMI clinicians-structural racism, race-related stress, cultural conflicts, and pressures to assimilate to Western values-produce a sense of internalized inferiority and dislocation from cultural strengths and healing wisdom of the Global Majority. At the same time, as clinics worldwide are becoming cultural environments of hyperdiversity due to increased migration <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(DelVecchio Good &amp; Hannah, 2015)</ref>, the cultural knowledge and multilingual skills of REMI providers are needed now more than ever. Thus, we recommend that decolonizing practices informed by critical consciousness and a global competency perspective be infused in mental health education and training to expand our capacity to promote healing and liberation for all.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Decolonizing Approaches to Mental Health Training, Education, and Supervision for REMI Clinicians</head><p>Recent years have seen a growing number of scholars call for the decolonization of the academy.</p><p>There is much debate about how to implement change so that it is meaningful rather than tokenistic; in general, those pushing for decolonization argue for root and branch change. This involves the use of anti-oppressive pedagogies that challenge hegemonic forms of instruction, evaluation, and knowledge production as well as a curriculum that centers non-Eurocentric voices and paradigms. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Goodman et al. (2015)</ref> listed five areas considered an essential part of the decolonization project within psychology: critical consciousness-raising as a goal of higher education; a curriculum interwoven with multiculturalism and social justice principles; pedagogies and practices that give voice to and empower those who are marginalized, while also cultivating meaningful self-reflection among trainees; community as central rather than peripheral to training; and lastly, political engagement. Cultural competence, they argue, along with notions of health and healing should all be congruent with a client's cultural values and norms. This same logic can be extended to training and supervision so that these arenas are similarly congruent with trainees' cultural backgrounds and perspectives.</p><p>The concept of critical consciousness was developed by the Brazilian educator Paulo Friere (1970) and describes a process through which oppressed groups learn to recognize and analyze the systems (e.g., racism, classism, sexism) that produce social inequity, and take action to change them.</p><p>While the social work profession was first to integrate critical consciousness into its training approaches (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Keefe, 1980)</ref>, psychology has more recently followed suit (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">French et al, 2020)</ref>. We view critical consciousness for REMI clinicians as a core process that strengthens their capacity to manage the stress and marginalization they face in the profession and become agents of change <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Nadal, 2017)</ref> While the concept of global competence has an array of contested meanings in the educational literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Engel et al., 2019)</ref>, here we emphasize a general orientation towards cultural pluralism versus cultural assimilation; investment in learning about local, global, and geopolitical issues that may affect our clients and intercultural relations; the capacity to engage in open, appropriate and effective interactions with people from different countries and cultures in all their complexity; and taking action to promote global mental health in an increasingly interconnected world. The construct of global competencies shifts attention to the cultural and linguistic advantages that REMI providers have in settings of hyperdiversity, emphasizing the value of bilingual and bicultural health communication skills and the ability to adapt one's practice interventions to CALD populations <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Lin &amp; Wiley, 2019)</ref>.</p><p>Institutional, curricular, and supervisory supports are needed to cultivate REMI clinicians' critical consciousness and global competencies, resist pressures to "assimilate to White contexts and White ways of practicing psychotherapy" <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Moon &amp; Sandage, 2019)</ref>, and develop a therapeutic stance that feels authentic, liberatory, and grounded in cultural and communal strengths. We offer the following recommendations to better meet the training needs of REMI clinicians in a globalizing world: Awareness 1. Provide opportunities for critical reflection and analysis of oneself and others as shaped by local and global histories and structures of power and domination. Engaging trainees in exploring their family's history may surface messages of internalized inferiority and intergenerational trauma, while nurturing cultural and communal strengths, and fostering a positive cultural identity.</p></div>
