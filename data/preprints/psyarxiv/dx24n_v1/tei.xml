<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Daily events like a relationship conflict, a work-related success, or a pleasant meeting with a friend can significantly influence people's well-being and mental health. To fully understand their psychological effects, different theories stress that people's subjective perception of daily events must be considered. However, a systematic examination of the perceived characteristics of daily events is still missing, which has led to jingle-jangle problems and the negligence of their perceived characteristics in existing research. To overcome these problems, we conducted a systematic literature review and four empirical studies (Ntotal = 1,468) to develop a taxonomy that systematically captures the perception of daily events on eight dimensions: positive emotion, challenge, relevance, threat to self, predictability, duty, sociality, and external control. Furthermore, we validated a measure -the Daily Event Questionnaire -to reliably and validly assess these perceived characteristics of daily events.</p><p>Applying our taxonomy and measure, we found that the perception of daily events systematically differed from the perception of everyday situations. Moreover, the perception of daily events predicted fluctuations in daily and weekly well-being over time. We discuss how this dimensional taxonomy of perceived event characteristics may advance future research and theory development regarding the effects of daily events on well-being and discuss similarities and differences between our taxonomy and taxonomies of the perception of situations and major life events.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Perceived Characteristics of Daily Events</head><p>Imagine that you experienced the following events today: In the morning, your alarm did not ring, so that that you missed the bus to work. At work, you had an argument with your boss regarding the progress of your latest project. Usually, you would easily overcome such hassles but today you experienced them as uncontrollable and relevant so that you are in a bad mood this evening. Luckily, a fun night with your friends cheered you up as you unexpectedly won the local pub quiz together. Your day was thus packed with numerous daily events-both positive and negative ones.</p><p>Daily events like the ones described above are time-discrete, frequently occurring life experiences that are perceived as relevant in the short term (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Brantley &amp; Jones, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b104">Serido et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b117">Wheaton et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b121">Zautra et al., 1986)</ref>. There is convincing evidence that daily events can impact people's mental health and their subjective well-being <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Almeida, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Day et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Kanner et al., 1981;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Newman &amp; Nezlek, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Panaite et al., 2021)</ref>. Furthermore, daily events are theorized to mediate the influences of major life events such as job loss or divorce on people's thoughts, feelings, and behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Jayawickreme et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Pillow et al., 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b105">Sheldon et al., 2013)</ref>. Therefore, daily events constitute a key ingredient for a comprehensive understanding of person-environment transactions, and they are of critical importance for theory and research in personality science. However, our understanding of how people experience these events and why people differ in their reaction to them is still limited.</p><p>To overcome these limitations, new ways to assess daily events seem necessary, as contemporary approaches offer only limited insights into these questions <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Haehner, Rakhshani, et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Luhmann et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Rauthmann et al., 2014)</ref>. Specifically, a more thorough consideration of the perception of daily events may advance our understanding of how daily events shape people's well-being and mental health in daily life <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Almeida, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Lazarus, 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b105">Sheldon et al., 2013)</ref>.</p><p>The goal of the present study was to develop a taxonomy of perceived characteristics of daily events that captures their psychologically relevant features on multiple dimensions. The development of such a dimensional taxonomy is a critical step towards a more comprehensive and theory-based understanding of how people experience daily events and how daily events shape people's well-being and mental health. In the present study, we therefore first summarized and integrated existing approaches to the assessment of daily events in a systematic review (Study 1). Informed by this review and a qualitative study (Study 2), we then developed a dimensional taxonomy of the perceived characteristics of daily events. Moreover, we established and validated a questionnaire to assess these perceived characteristics of daily events (Studies 3 to 4). Finally, we examined how different perceived event characteristics of this taxonomy are related to fluctuations in subjective well-being in daily life (Study 5).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conceptualization of Daily Events</head><p>Different conceptualizations of daily eventssometimes also referred to as daily hassles and uplifts (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Kanner et al., 1981)</ref> or minor life events (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Monroe, 1983</ref>)have been suggested over the past decades. Most definitions converge on four broad features of daily events: daily events (1) are subjectively important to individuals, <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">(2)</ref> are more frequent and less influential than major life events, like for example, a job loss or the death of a loved one, (3) include experiences that arise in daily life and that can disrupt daily life, and (4) have a discrete beginning and end <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Brantley &amp; Jones, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">DeLongis et al., 1982;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Monroe, 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b104">Serido et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b108">Stone &amp; Neale, 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b117">Wheaton et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b121">Zautra et al., 1986)</ref>. Integrating these definitions, we conceptualize daily events as time-discrete, frequently occurring life experiences that can disrupt daily life and that are perceived as relevant in the short term.</p><p>This definition highlights that daily events can be distinguished from other life experiences such as major life events and situations based on their influence and frequency (Figure <ref type="figure">1A</ref>). Specifically, daily events are less influential and more frequent than major life events. Furthermore, in contrast to major life events, daily events are not characterized by discrete changes in demographic variables like changes in employment status from employed to unemployed <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Luhmann et al., 2014)</ref>. Daily events also differ from situations that involve any fleeting circumstances in daily life and can thus be examined continuously because people are always engaged in situations <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">(Rauthmann et al., 2015)</ref>. In contrast, daily events are more sporadic and considered to disrupt the regular flow of everyday situations, because they are perceived as relevant. Moreover, a daily event like an argument with a friend can expand across several situations like an unfriendly text message, a verbal confrontation, and ruminating about the dispute <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Luhmann et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>Although there may be some overlap between situations, daily events, and major life events (Figure <ref type="figure">1A</ref>), a holistic assessment of life experiences requires the consideration of daily events. Due to these differences in their characteristics, situations, daily events, and major life events may be suitable to predict outcomes on different time scales and be best examined with different designs (Figure <ref type="figure">1B</ref>). Specifically, examining daily events could be relevant to identify effects that neither unfold at the momentary level, nor over a longer timeframe, such as changes in daily mood <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">(Verduyn et al., 2012)</ref>. Hence, considering daily events seems necessary for a comprehensive examination of transactions between individuals and their environment.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Relevance of Daily Events in Research on Person-Environment Transactions</head><p>A central goal of personality science is to contribute to the understanding of personenvironment transactions, that is, the dynamic interplay of personal characteristics and environmental experiences over time <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">(Rauthmann, 2021)</ref>. Research on person-environment transactions aims to address questions such as (1) how do environmental experiences lead to changes in personal characteristics such as well-being (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Bühler et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Denissen et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Luhmann et al., 2012)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">(2)</ref> what are the mechanisms linking personal characteristics and environmental experiences over time (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Buss, 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Jayawickreme et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Rauthmann, 2021)</ref>, and (3) how do personal characteristics predict the occurrence of environmental experiences <ref type="bibr">(Haehner &amp; Bleidorn, 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Rnic et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Santee et al., 2023)</ref>. The examination of daily events plays a key role in addressing all three questions <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Almeida, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b105">Sheldon et al., 2013</ref>; Figure <ref type="figure">1B</ref>). In the following sections, we briefly summarize the current research state of whether and how daily events act as (1) predictors, (2) mediators, and (3) outcomes of personenvironment transactions before outlining open questions in each of these research strands.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Daily Events as Predictors of Psychological Change</head><p>Understanding when and why psychological characteristics like subjective well-being, mental health, or personality traits change is a critical question to promote health and wellbeing in the general population <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bleidorn et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Buecker et al., 2023)</ref>. Over the past decades, evidence has accumulated that daily events can predict changes in a range of psychological characteristics (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Asselmann et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Kanner et al., 1981;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Newman &amp; Nezlek, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Pillow et al., 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b123">Zheng et al., 2023)</ref>.</p><p>First, daily hassles like work-related conflicts or relationship problems have been found to predict decreases in subjective well-being, whereas daily uplifts tend to predict increases in subjective well-being and buffer the effects of daily hassles <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(McCullough et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Mroczek &amp; Almeida, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Newman &amp; Nezlek, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Nezlek et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b113">Vize et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr">Zheng et al., 2023)</ref>. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">Vize et al. (2023)</ref> found in an experience sampling study that daily hassles predicted momentary negative affect and partly accounted for the link between maladaptive personal characteristics and negative affect.</p><p>Second, daily hassles can predict the onset of a range of mental disorders such as depression, anxiety disorders, or obsessive-compulsive disorders (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Asselmann et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Chan et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">D'Angelo &amp; Wierzbicki, 2003)</ref>. Relatedly, daily hassles have also been linked to an increase in general psychopathology. Interestingly, the effects of accumulated daily events on general psychopathology were even stronger than the corresponding effects of major life events, further underlining the importance of daily events <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(DeLongis et al., 1982;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Jandorf et al., 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Kanner et al., 1981;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Monroe, 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Pillow et al., 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b116">Weinberger et al., 1987)</ref>.</p><p>Third, there is initial evidence that the repeated occurrence of daily events may contribute to personality development <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Dugan et al., 2023)</ref>. For example, repeatedly accomplishing something that people were proud of predicted an increase in conscientiousness, extraversion, emotional stability, and openness. Moreover, <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Ion et al. (2023)</ref> found that daily events accounted for within-person variability in momentary personality states, indicating that daily events influence the expression of personality. In sum, accumulating evidence supports the relevance of daily events in predicting changes in important psychological characteristics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Daily Events as Mediators of the Effects of Major Life Events</head><p>Examining daily events is not only important because these life experiences may exert a direct influence on important life outcomes, but also because daily events are thought to mediate the influence of other life experiences such as major life events. That is, the psychological effects of major life events, like a new job, may depend on the relatively minor changes that these events impose on people's daily life, such as interactions at work, positive feedback, or success in completing work related-tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bleidorn et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Luhmann et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Pillow et al., 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b119">Wright et al., 2020)</ref>. For example, the Hedonic Adaptation Prevention Model <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">(Sheldon et al., 2013)</ref> suggests that daily events mediate the effects of major life events on subjective well-being and that the variety and novelty of these daily events influence how fast people adapt to the major life event. Similarly, theoretical perspectives on personality development predict that major life events may lead to changes in personality traits via changing experiences in daily life <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">(Roberts &amp; Nickel, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b120">Wrzus &amp; Roberts, 2017)</ref>. For example, a new job may increase a person's conscientiousness through the repeated experience of daily events like missing the bus or struggling with finishing a project in time. These daily hassles may motivate a lasting change in people's behaviors to better fulfill the requirements of the new social role.</p><p>Initial evidence supports the hypothesis that daily events act as catalysts of the effects of major life events. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Sahl et al. (2009)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">Wagner et al. (1988)</ref> found that daily events mediated a substantial proportion of variance of the effects of major life events on distress. More recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Jayawickreme et al. (2023)</ref> replicated and extended these findings in a large-scale longitudinal study with weekly assessments over one year. They found that the occurrence of negative major life events predicted a subsequent increase in the occurrence of negative daily events, which in turn predicted a decrease in well-being in daily life.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Daily Events as Outcomes of Stress Generation Processes</head><p>Beyond acting as predictors and mediators in person-environment transactions, daily events may also constitute important outcomes of person-environment transactions as part of stress generation processes. Stress generation describes the phenomenon that stressful life experiences are not random but that individuals contribute to the experience of stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Elliot et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Hammen, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Liu &amp; Alloy, 2010)</ref>. While most stress generation research has focused on how personal characteristics like personality traits predict the occurrence of major life events <ref type="bibr">(Haehner &amp; Bleidorn, 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Rnic et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Santee et al., 2023)</ref>, there is initial evidence suggesting that momentary personal characteristics like personality states can predict the occurrence of daily hassles <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">(Ringwald et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b113">Vize et al., 2023)</ref>. For example, being more hostile in the morning was related to the occurrence of interpersonal stressors throughout the day <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">(Sahl et al., 2009)</ref>. In conjunction with research on daily events as predictors of changes in mental health and well-being, stress generation processes of daily hassles may lead to a vicious cycle of maladaptive personal characteristics and stressful daily events <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Liu &amp; Alloy, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Rnic et al., 2023)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary and Open Questions</head><p>In summary, daily events are important life experiences that can (1) predict changes in psychological characteristics like subjective well-being, (2) mediate the influence of major life events on psychological outcomes, and (3) be the outcome of stress generation processes.</p><p>Although daily events are thus of central relevance for the dynamic interplay between personal characteristics and environmental experiences, they have received less attention in research than major life events <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Kanner et al., 1981;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Luhmann et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b117">Wheaton et al., 2013)</ref>.</p><p>As a result, there are limitations and open questions regarding each of the three research branches that need to be addressed to fully understand the effects of daily events and to advance theory development regarding the role of daily events in person-environment transactions. First, there is little integrative research on the effects of daily events. The lack of systematic reviews and meta-analyses likely has to do with the wide range of ways in which daily events have been conceptualized and assessed across studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b119">(Wright et al., 2020)</ref>. Second, although there is evidence that the effects of daily events differ systematically across people and events, there is limited knowledge about the factors that can explain these differences <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Brantley &amp; Jones, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Dugan et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b123">Zheng et al., 2023)</ref>. For example, questions of which characteristics of daily events are psychologically relevant for whom, and which daily events may mediate the effects of major life events on psychological change still need to be addressed. Third, existing theoretical claims regarding the relevance of certain characteristics of daily events such as variety and novelty (see, <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">Sheldon et al., 2013)</ref> or self-relevance and level of understanding <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">(Wilson &amp; Gilbert, 2008)</ref> remain largely untested.</p><p>These limitations are all related to the question of how to conceptualize and assess psychologically relevant characteristics of daily events, and they can at least partly be attributed to the fact that there is no established framework to assess these characteristics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Challenges and Limitations in the Assessment of Daily Events</head><p>In existing research, daily events were mostly assessed using checklists such as the Daily Hassles and Uplift Scales <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Kanner et al., 1981)</ref> or the Combined Hassles and Uplift Scales <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Lazarus &amp; Folkman, 1989)</ref>. With such checklists, participants retrospectively mark all the daily events they have experienced during a certain time (e.g., the last month), which are then typically aggregated as a sum score of experienced hassles and/or uplifts. Some checklists allow the additional assessment of participants' perceptions of these daily events on one or few potentially relevant dimensions, such as valence or severity, to weigh the psychological relevance of different daily events (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Brantley et al., 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">Sarason et al., 1978)</ref>.</p><p>However, these traditional assessment approaches have several limitations. First, checklists rely on a categorical classification of daily events and thus suffer from the problem of intracategorical variability <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Dohrenwend, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Luhmann et al., 2021)</ref>. That is, people differ in their interpretation of certain categories, so that quite different life experiences are subsumed under a specific category. For example, daily events that may differ in their psychological affordances such as visiting one's grandparents, helping a friend, or an informal get-together of coworkers could all be categorized as social obligations, limiting reliability and content validity of checklist approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Dohrenwend, 2006)</ref>. To mitigate this problem, most checklist comprise long lists of daily events, which tend to make them quite burdensome for participants to complete. Second, retrospective assessment tools that list daily events that occurred in the past (e.g., the past month) can result in memory bias and reliability issues, particularly because daily events tend to be less memorable than major life events <ref type="bibr" target="#b119">(Wright et al., 2020)</ref>. Even though this limitation could be overcome by using checklists with narrower time frames (e.g., the past day in in daily diary studies), validated checklists often comprise too many items to be assessed multiple times per week. Third and relatedly, many studies have assessed daily events using adhoc measures whose psychometric qualities and content validity have not been examined (see also results of Study 1). For example, it has been common practice to modify existing assessment approaches by reducing checklists of daily events to a shorter subset of items that are more feasible for frequent assessments in daily diary studies (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Aronson et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b122">Zenk et al., 2017)</ref>. Fourth, so far, there has been little systematic research on the assessment of participants' subjective experience and perception of daily events. Even though some measures (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Brantley et al., 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">Sarason et al., 1978)</ref> include items that allow participants to rate their perception of daily events, these items have been often selected based on idiosyncratic research interests, tend to vary across scales, and are thus subject to jingle-jangle fallacies (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Haehner, Würtz, et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Rauthmann et al., 2014)</ref>. That is, the definition and naming of dimensions such as severity, undesirability, or valence differ across scales, and the dimensions are in most cases not based on any theoretical or empirical foundation <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Kanner et al., 1981;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b108">Stone &amp; Neale, 1980)</ref>.</p><p>As a consequence of these problems and the lacking agreement on how to best capture daily events, the assessment of daily events differs substantially across studies, impairing knowledge integration <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(DeMeo et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b119">Wright et al., 2020)</ref>. Furthermore, the limitations of the existing assessment approaches impede addressing pressing research questions such as why people differ in their reaction to daily events. To overcome these limitations, a revision of the conceptualization and the assessment of daily events may be required that is more in line with theoretical accounts and assessment approaches of other life experiences.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Considering the Perception of Daily Events in Their Conceptualization and Assessment</head><p>Although various conceptualizations of daily events have been suggested over the past decades, it seems to be common ground that the perception of daily events plays a key role for their effects on people's everyday life <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Almeida, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Kanner et al., 1981;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Lazarus, 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b105">Sheldon et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b118">Wilson &amp; Gilbert, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b119">Wright et al., 2020)</ref>. That is, the perception of daily events is considered as active ingredient of how the occurrence of daily events leads to changes in psychological variables such as well-being or mental health <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Luhmann et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Rauthmann et al., 2014)</ref>. For example, whether a daily event such as missing the bus to work leads to changes in subjective well-being is theorized to depend on how novel or controllable this event is perceived <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Abramson et al., 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b105">Sheldon et al., 2013)</ref>. Consequently, the perception of daily events should be an integral part of their assessment and careful consideration should be given to the selection of the dimensions of event perception.</p><p>Making the perception of daily events an integral part of their assessment would also allow researchers to compare the perception of these types of events with other life experiences such as situations and major life events. That is, considering the perception of daily events would allow drawing on recent advantages in their assessment that helped to overcome problems associated with solely categorical assessments <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Dohrenwend, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Haehner, Rakhshani, et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Luhmann et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Rauthmann et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Rauthmann &amp; Sherman, 2020)</ref>. For both situations and major life events, dimensional taxonomies of their perceived characteristics have developed in the past 10 years. For example, the DIAMONDS taxonomy describes eight perceived characteristics of situations <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">(Rauthmann et al., 2014)</ref>, and the Event Characteristics Questionnaire (ECQ) comprises nine perceived characteristics of major life events <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Luhmann et al., 2021)</ref>. Both taxonomies were empirically derived, validated, and have led to meaningful advancements in research on situations and major life events. For example, they have inspired new research questions and provided insights into individual differences in the reaction to different life experiences <ref type="bibr">(Haehner, Bleidorn, et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr">Haehner, Kritzler, et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Kuper et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Rauthmann et al., 2015)</ref>. However, as daily events differ from major life events and situations in terms of influence and duration (Figure <ref type="figure">1A</ref>), the ECQ and DIAMONDS taxonomies may not be directly applied to the examination of daily events. For example, event characteristics such as perceived world-view changes may not be relevant to the experience of daily events, but other event characteristics relevant to the perception of daily events such as novelty may be missing <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Luhmann et al., 2021)</ref>. Thus, the development of a new dimensional taxonomy of perceived characteristics of daily events is needed. Developing such a taxonomy and thus using a strategy similar to the assessment of situations and major life events would also facilitate a holistic assessment of life experiences and knowledge integration. In summary, to overcome the limitations of existing assessment approaches of daily events, the perception of daily events should play a central role in their assessment. As such, careful consideration should be given to the selection of the perceived characteristics of daily events. Instead of just arbitrarily selecting perceived event characteristics, the development of a broad taxonomy that allows the assessment of the perception of daily events on multiple dimensions is needed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Present Article</head><p>The overall goal of the present article was to advance the understanding of daily events by developing a dimensional taxonomy of their perceived characteristics and validating a questionnaire to assess these characteristics. To do so, we conducted five studies. First, we conducted a systematic review to summarize and integrate approaches to the assessment of daily events and to provide an overview of which perceived event characteristics have been assessed in existing research. Second, we conducted a qualitative study in which participants described their experience of daily events to ensure that we did not miss any important dimensions of people's event perception. Based on the systematic review, the qualitative study, theories on the perception on daily events, and existing approaches to the assessment of the perception of situations and major life events, we developed a large item pool. In two crosssectional studies, we then developed a taxonomy of perceived characteristics of daily events <ref type="bibr">(Daily Event Eight;</ref>. Moreover, we selected items to assess those eight perceived characteristics of daily events using different analytical approaches and we examined the psychometric quality of the resulting Daily Event Questionnaire (DEQ). Finally, we employed the Daily Event Questionnaire in a daily diary study to replicate findings on the psychometric quality and to illustrate its utility for predicting fluctuations in subjective well-being.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 1: Systematic Literature Review</head><p>The primary goal of Study 1 was to provide a systematic overview of the assessment of daily events in existing research: Which measures have been used to assess daily hassles? How was the perception of daily events considered? Which event characteristics have been assessed?</p><p>This overview provided the basis for the development of a taxonomy of the perception of daily events.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Systematic Literature Search</head><p>The systematic literature search was conducted in September 2021 using the database PsycINFO<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">foot_0</ref> . We applied the following search string: TI (("minor life event*" OR "daily hassle*"</p><p>OR "daily uplift*" OR "daily stressor*")) OR AB (("minor life event*" OR "daily hassle*" OR "daily uplift*" OR "daily stressor*")) OR KW (("minor life event*" OR "daily hassle*" OR "daily uplift*" OR "daily stressor*")). Additionally, we restricted the literature search to empirical journal articles written in English. The systematic literature search resulted in a total number of 1,157 studies published between 1981 and 2022.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Coding Procedure</head><p>Four independent coders evaluated the eligibility of the 1,157 studies for our systematic review. Studies were eligible to be included in the review if they were quantitative, empirical journal articles written in English that assessed the occurrence of daily events. To determine eligibility, the coders skimmed the methods and results section of the papers. If a study fulfilled the inclusion criteria, coders extracted information on the study design and on the assessment of daily events (e.g., which instrument was used, if the instrument was validated, or which perceived event characteristics were assessed). If several instruments were used within one article to assess daily events, those instruments were coded separately. More details on our coding procedure and the extracted data can be retrieved from OSF. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> illustrates our coding process.</p><p>To estimate interrater agreement, a subset of 101 of the 1,157 articles was double-coded.</p><p>The interrater agreement across coders and coding categories was κ = .69 (SD = .12), indicating good interrater reliability <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(McHugh, 2012</ref>). An analysis of the interrater reliability per coded category and pair of raters can be found in the supplemental material.</p><p>During the coding process, we noticed several jingle-jangle-fallacies in the assessment of perceived event characteristics <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Kelley, 1927)</ref>. That is, the perceived event characteristics</p><p>were named differently across articles even though the same scale was used, or the same name was used although qualitatively different event characteristics were assessed. Consequently, we followed the idea of the Grounded Theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Glaser et al., 1968)</ref> to provide consistent labels for perceived event characteristics across articles. To do so, we added a new perceived event characteristic to our coding system if the scale could not be assigned to one of the existing perceived event characteristics of our coding system. After all scales were assigned to a perceived event characteristic, an independent coder reassigned all scales to the perceived event characteristics to estimate interrater reliability of the coding system. The interrater reliability was κ = .75, indicating substantial agreement between the two raters <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(McHugh, 2012)</ref>. More details on this coding procedure can be found in the supplemental material. PRISMA Flow Diagram of the Systematic Literature Review Note. The number of instruments exceeds the number of relevant articles in the PRISMA Flow Diagram (Page et al., 2021), as some articles used multiple instruments to assess daily events.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study Designs and Instruments</head><p>Overall, 854 studies were included in the systematic review. Most studies (51%) assessed daily events retrospectively using a cross-sectional study design, whereas 27% applied an experience sampling or daily diary method, and 20% had a long-term longitudinal design.</p><p>The timeframes in the instructions of daily event measures ranged from a few hours to 2 years (M = 4.86 weeks, SD = 11.06).</p><p>Only 12% of the studies used a validated instrument to assess daily events (i.e., referenced a source for the instrument and reported construct validity), with additional 45% using a possibly validated instrument (i.e., referenced a source for the instrument without reporting validity evidence). In contrast, 44% of studies either used a modified version of an existing measure (e.g., dropped items or added additional items) or relied on a non-validated ad-hoc questionnaire.</p><p>Among the validated instruments, the Daily Hassles Scale (DHS) by <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Kanner et al. (1981)</ref> was the most frequently used instrument. The DHS measures the severity of 56 hassles (e.g., misplacing or losing things) on a 3-point rating scale ranging from 1 = somewhat severe to 3 = extremely severe. Other daily event measures differ from the DHS in the number of recorded daily events, with checklists comprising 3 to 264 daily events (M = 46.75, SD = 43.26).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Assessment of Perceived Event Characteristics</head><p>We found that 71% of the studies assessed at least one perceived event characteristic</p><p>(Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). The measures applied in these studies mostly assessed only one (k = 538, 83%) or two perceived event characteristics (k = 81, 13%). The most frequently assessed perceived characteristic was negative emotions (k = 480, 58%), describing the extent to which an event was experienced as stressful or troublesome. In contrast, only 37 studies (4.5%) assessed valence (bipolar scale ranging from negative emotion to positive emotion), and 35 studies (4%) assessed positive emotions. Another recurrently assessed perceived event characteristic was perceived frequency (k = 77, 9%), where participants rate the frequency of the occurrence of daily events on a Likert scale (e.g., from 1 = never to 4 = often). Existing research also sporadically assessed several further perceived characteristics such as rumination, predictability, or uncertainty. Importantly, these characteristics are only partly included in existing taxonomies of perceived characteristics of situations (DIAMONDS) or major life events (ECQ).</p><p>Our systematic review also indicated that the assessment of the perception of daily events was often confounded (k = 299, 47% of studies) with the frequency of the occurrence of daily events. For example, if dimensional ratings on negative emotions are summed across all experienced events of a checklist, a high score could indicate a higher score of negative emotions for a specific event or a high number of experienced negative events. </p></div>

The term target refers to the person who experienced the daily event.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>The results of the literature review show that research on daily events encounters several difficulties. First, daily events have been frequently assessed in cross-sectional studies using retrospective methods. However, these methods are affected by memory bias and mooddependent recall, leading to biases in the estimation of the effects of daily events' on current psychological outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b119">(Wright et al., 2020)</ref>. Relatedly, research has often relied on nonvalidated or modified instruments to assess daily events, further questioning existing measurement approaches. Second, similar to findings on major life events, there has been a</p><p>focus on negative daily events <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Luhmann et al., 2021)</ref>. This is problematic, because research suggests that positive daily events can be of similar relevance for people's well-being and mental health (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Gable et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b110">Totenhagen et al., 2012)</ref>. Third, the wide range of terms used to describe perceived event characteristics challenges a systematic integration and accumulating research results across studies. Developing unified definitions and measurement approaches for a comprehensive set of perceived characteristics of daily events would be needed to overcome these jingle-jangle fallacies <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Haehner, Würtz, et al., 2024)</ref>. Fourth, studies have often assessed only one or a few relevant perceived event characteristics without explanation of why these characteristics were chosen, which might limit the predictive power of daily events if relevant perceived characteristics are neglected. Fifth, event perception scores have often been confounded with the frequency of the occurrence of daily events, making it difficult to understand which aspects of specific daily events are related to relevant outcome variables.</p><p>As outlined in the theoretical background, simultaneously assessing the perception of daily events on multiple perceived event characteristics offers a promising approach to overcome these limitations <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Luhmann et al., 2021)</ref>. To do so, a dimensional taxonomy of the characteristics of daily events needs to be established that allows to comprehensively assess these characteristics and that can serve as an integrative framework for future research. The results of the literature review are a useful foundation for the development of such a dimensional taxonomy as they provide a systematic overview of the characteristics of daily events that have been assessed in existing research. As such, the results of our review served as basis for the development of a broad item pool of perceived characteristics of daily events that covered the range of potentially relevant dimensions of event perception.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 2: Qualitative Study and Development of an Item Pool</head><p>To further inform the development of a comprehensive item pool, the goal of Study 2 was to identify further potentially relevant perceived event characteristics that have been missed in the existing literature. Hence, Study 2 was a qualitative study, in which participants freely described their subjective experience of a positive and negative daily event that they had recently experienced.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>Using convenience sampling methods, we recruited N = 117 German-speaking adults.</p><p>As preregistered, we excluded participants who provided no or incorrect answers to an instructed response item (e.g., "To ensure data quality, please select the response option yes"), which led to a final sample size of N = 90 participants. On average, participants were 25.48 years old (SD = 8.83). 70% of the sample were female, and 10% indicated that they were not born in Germany.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure and Measures</head><p>After providing informed consent and basic demographic information, participants were asked to name a daily event they had recently experienced. To receive ratings of more and less recent events, participants were randomly assigned to one of the following time frames to recall the daily event: past day, past week, and past month. Using open-response fields, participants then described the event, their perception of it, its causes, and its consequences. Additionally, we asked participants to assign the event to a life domain (e.g., family, religion, health, or finances), to indicate when the event occurred, how long the event lasted, and whether they had experienced such an event before. Each participant described two events: a positive and a negative one (in random order). More details on the design and materials of the qualitative study can be found in the study-design preregistration.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Analysis and Coding</head><p>We employed an inductive-content coding approach to summarize the free-text descriptions of daily events. In line with the characteristics found in taxonomies of situations and major life events, we coded the described consequences, causes, and perceived style (i.e., the way in which the event was experienced) for each event <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Luhmann et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Rauthmann et al., 2014)</ref>. Furthermore, we assigned each daily event to event types and coded activities and people involved in the event to gain an impression of the event content. To do so, we used approximately one quarter of all given answers to create a preliminary coding scheme by paraphrasing given answers and summarizing similar answers to coding categories. We then revised this preliminary coding scheme by re-applying it to the first quarter of open-response answers through an independent coder and by incorporating feedback from an independent researcher. The final coding scheme can be retrieved from the OSF.</p><p>Coding with the final scheme was done by two independent coders. One coder (i.e., the main coder) coded 100% of all open-response answers. The second coder (i.e., the reliability coder) coded 33% of all answers that were not included in the development of the coding scheme. Interrater agreement across all coding categories was acceptable (89%).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results and Discussion</head><p>In the following sections, we summarize how participants described the content, style, causes, and consequences of the daily events they had recently experienced. More details on our findings and separate results for positive and negative daily events can be found in the supplemental material. First, regarding the content of the experienced events, we found that the most frequent event types in our sample were meeting close persons (n = 40), mobility-related events (n = 20), and work-related events (n = 15). The most frequently mentioned activities were conversations (n = 65), eating or drinking (n = 24), and mobility (n = 24), and most events involved either nobody (n = 73) or friends (n = 37).</p><p>Second, regarding style-related characteristics, participants almost exclusively referred to the valence of the experienced daily events (n = 169), indicating that valence may be a central property of daily events. Other mentioned style-related characteristics were threat (n = 12), predictability (n = 8), and extraordinariness (n = 6).</p><p>Third, regarding the event cause, participants mostly described that they controlled the occurrence of the event themselves (n = 87). However, also (known) other people (n = 83) and external factors such as coincidence or unknown other people (n = 57) were commonly described as event causes. Furthermore, events were mostly described as unplanned (n = 105).</p><p>Fourth, participants described the consequences of the events for themselves as well as for other people. Most frequently, participants referred to emotional changes (self-experienced: n = 142, experienced by others: n = 59), own positive cognitive changes (n = 29), changes to daily routines (n = 26), and own negative cognitive changes (n = 20). Thus, daily events seem to be relevant to all aspects of human behavior (affect, behavior, and cognition).</p><p>Overall, these categorical descriptions provide an illustration of what people perceived as important characteristics of daily events. These characteristics show substantial overlap with the characteristics identified in the systematic literature review (e.g., valence, control, emotional changes) and the characteristics included in taxonomies of situations and major life events. For example, the content of daily events was closely related to the dimensions of sociality and duty of the DIAMONDS taxonomy <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">(Rauthmann et al., 2014)</ref>. Likewise, the mentioned style characteristics such as threat, extraordinariness, and, predictability overlap with subscales of the ECQ <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Luhmann et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>However, participants' descriptions also comprised some new characteristics of the experience of daily events that were not yet considered in existing literature. For example, additional relevant content dimensions for daily events may be related to mobility and leisure activities. Furthermore, compared to consequence-related characteristics included in the ECQ (e.g., social status change, change in world views), the consequences of daily events seem to be on a narrower level, indicating that characteristics related to changes in the daily routine might be helpful to describe the perception of daily events. In summary, it seems necessary to examine whether additional characteristics beyond those already discussed in the existing literature are needed to fully capture the perception of daily events.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Development of an Item Pool</head><p>Based on the results of Study 1 and Study 2, we developed a comprehensive item pool for assessing perceived characteristics of daily events. This item pool drew on five sources.</p><p>First, it included items to assess perceived event characteristics that were identified in the systematic literature review. Second, we developed items capturing the perceived characteristics that were identified in the qualitative study. Third, we developed items to assess perceived characteristics that were included in theories of daily events <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Abramson et al., 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Almeida, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b105">Sheldon et al., 2013)</ref>. Fourth, due to the conceptual similarity of major life events and daily events, we included items of ECQ <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Luhmann et al., 2021)</ref>, which assesses the perception of major life events on nine dimensions (valence, impact, predictability, challenge, emotional significance, change in world views, social status changes, external control, and extraordinariness). Fifth, we also included items to assess the perception of situations.</p><p>Specifically, we included items from the DIAMONDS taxonomy <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">(Rauthmann et al., 2014)</ref> and items based on the CAPTION <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Parrigon et al., 2017)</ref> scales humor and typicality to fully cover the breadth of contemporary situation taxonomies <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">(Rauthmann &amp; Sherman, 2020)</ref>. However, the wording of the items from the ECQ, DIAMONDS, and CAPTION taxonomies was partly revised to be consistent with the wording of the other items to assess daily events (e.g., the item "Die Situation ist erfreulich" [The situation is pleasing] was changed to "Das Ereignis war erfreulich" [The event was pleasing]).</p><p>These five item development strategies led to an initial item pool of 232 items. However, among these 232 items, several items were redundant. Therefore, five researchers rated whether each item should be included in the final item pool based on the following criteria: (a)</p><p>preference of items from existing taxonomies in case of redundancy (to increase comparability with existing research), (b) comprehensibility of the item text, (c) applicability of the item for different types of daily events, (d) simplicity of the item formulation, (e) inclusion of positive and negative formulated items. In an item conference, a final pool of 120 items was selected by integrating the ratings of the five independent researchers (see supplemental material). This final item pool was then evaluated in two cross-sectional empirical studies described next.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 3 and Study 4: Exploratory and Confirmatory Factor Analysis</head><p>Based on our final item pool, we next aimed to develop a dimensional taxonomy of the perceived characteristics of daily events. This taxonomy should allow for a comprehensive assessment of perceived event characteristics and organize research on the perception of daily events by providing a classification and consistent terminology. Additionally, we aimed to create a questionnaire that reliably and validly assesses the perceived characteristics of this taxonomy.</p><p>To achieve these goals, Study 3 and 4 comprised three steps. First, we used an exploratory approach to identify an optimal number of perceived characteristics of daily events (Study 3). Second, we selected the best items according to multiple criteria (e.g., item distributions, content validity, and descriptive item parameters) within each perceived event characteristic to create a questionnaire to assess these perceived event characteristics. More specifically, we aimed to create a short, modular questionnaire with one to three items per perceived event characteristic that is suitable for assessing the perception of daily events close to their occurrence, namely in daily dairy or experience sampling studies. Third, we tested whether the event perception scores derived from the newly developed questionnaire were reliable and demonstrated construct validity, including the replication of the factor structure in an independent data set (Study 4).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample</head><p>Participants for Study 3 and Study 4 were recruited using convenience sampling methods. To take part in the study, participants had to be at least 18 years old. We aimed for a sample size of N = 400 participants for Studies 3 to 4, as suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Goretzko et al. (2021)</ref> for factor analyses, but restricted the data collection to a specific date due to time constraints.</p><p>To ensure data quality, we excluded participants who answered the two instructed response 81% identified as female, 17% as male, and 2% as non-binary. In terms of education, 87% of the participants had a high school diploma. In Study 4, the final sample included N = 335 participants, of which 72% identified as female, 28% as male, and 0% as non-binary. The age ranged from 18 to 63 years with a mean of M = 28.16 years (SD = 9.58) and 92% of the participants reported that a high school diploma was their highest educational qualification.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure and Measures</head><p>The procedure and the assessed measures of Study 3 and Study 4 were mostly identical.</p><p>After completing the study registration, participants provided demographic information.</p><p>Moreover, participants read a short definition of daily events and described a daily event that they experienced within the last week. The exact timeframe was randomized for each participant and varied from a minimum of 0 (i.e., event was experienced today) to a maximum of 7 days (i.e., event was experienced up to 7 days ago). After describing the event, participants rated the 120 items (see section Development of an Item Pool) to assess perceived event characteristics on a scale ranging from 1 = not true at all to 5 = absolutely true. Additionally, participants answered questions regarding their mood <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Diener et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Rahm et al., 2017)</ref>, life satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Diener et al., 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Glaesmer et al., 2011)</ref>, and personality traits <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(Rammstedt et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b107">Soto &amp; John, 2017)</ref>. In Study 4, participants additionally completed a questionnaire regarding their mental health and two questionnaires to assess interpretation bias of ambiguous situations-however, those data were not assessed or analysed for the present study. At the end of the survey, participants were thanked for their participation and could obtain feedback on their personality traits and/or course credit.</p><p>Step 1: Exploratory Factor Analysis</p><p>The exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was conducted with data of Study 3. Our data analysis procedure comprised several steps.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Preliminary Analyses</head><p>First, we calculated the correlation matrix of all items. Here, we had to deviate from our preregistration, because we used a correlation matrix based on Pearson correlations instead of the pre-registered polychoric correlations, as the polychoric correlation matrix was not positive definite (see supplemental material for further details). Next, we evaluated if the data are suitable for conducting an EFA (i.e., whether the items share substantial variance). Both the Bartlett test <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bartlett, 1950)</ref> and the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin criterion (KMO; <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Kaiser, 1974)</ref> supported the suitability of the data for an EFA (Bartlett Test: χ 2 (7410) = 41,038.43, p &lt; .001; KMO = .92).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Factor Number</head><p>Second, following <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Goretzko et al. (2021)</ref>, we used multiple methods to determine the optimal number of factors. We calculated two different parallel analyses with the psych package </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Final Factor Solution</head><p>Third, we performed an EFA for all suggested factor solutions (i.e., 8, 9, 12, 14, and 16 factors) with the fa function from the psych package <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">(Revelle, 2023)</ref> and the Maximum Likelihood estimator as the extraction method <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Bühner, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Goretzko et al., 2021)</ref>. Following current EFA guidelines <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Bühner, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Goretzko et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b115">Watkins, 2021)</ref>, we further applied and compared two different oblique rotation methods (i.e., promax and oblimin rotation). The factor solutions were evaluated regarding their (1) simple structure (i.e., high primary loadings, low cross-loadings) and ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>) their interpretability (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Luhmann et al., 2021</ref> for a similar approach).</p><p>The factor solutions derived from the oblimin and promax rotation led to similar results.</p><p>However, the factor solutions derived from the promax rotation were more difficult to interpret Furthermore, we excluded the factor solutions with 12, 14, or 16 factors because in each of these factor solutions at least one factor emerged on which only two items loaded substantially.</p><p>Finally, the 9-factor solutions had more cross-loadings than the 8-factor solution. We therefore decided on the 8-factor solution including the factors positive emotion, challenge, relevance, threat to self, predictability, duty, sociality, and external control. These eight factors represent our empirically derived taxonomy of perceived characteristics of daily events (Daily Event Eight; DE-8).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Bass-Ackwards Analysis</head><p>Fourth, we conducted a factor analysis based on the bass-ackwards method <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Goldberg, 2006)</ref> with the bassAckward function from the psych package <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">(Revelle, 2023)</ref>. The bassackwards method allows to investigate the hierarchical structure of the factors (i.e., how factors split up when a new factor is added to the factor). The results from the bass-ackwards analysis further supported the 8-factor solution, as most factors emerging later in the factor tree can be interpreted as facets of one of the eight dimensions (e.g., fun as facet of positive impact, or rumination as facet of relevance; see Figure <ref type="figure">SM1</ref> to Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">SM2</ref> in the supplemental material).</p><p>The detailed results including the factor loadings of each item from each calculated factor analysis can be found in the supplemental material.</p><p>Step 2: Item selection Study 3 indicated that the perception of daily events comprises eight perceived event characteristics. However, in order to develop a short questionnaire that assesses the dimensions of this taxonomy, we had to select the best performing items for each of the eight perceived event characteristics within the final item pool. To do so, we used data from Study 3 and Study 4. Following current recommendations on scale construction <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Clark &amp; Watson, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Goetz et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Rammstedt &amp; Beierlein, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b124">Ziegler et al., 2014)</ref>, we based the item selection on multiple criteria.</p><p>First, we evaluated the items regarding various descriptive parameters: We preferred items (1) with an item mean close to the scale mid-point (while item means should still differ within one subscale), ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>) with high variance, (3) with a skew close to zero, (4) with a kurtosis close to zero, (5) with a normal distribution of item responses, ( <ref type="formula">6</ref>) with a high item-total correlation (items that correlate strongly with total score of the subscale), ( <ref type="formula">7</ref>) with high primary and low cross-loadings in the EFA conducted in Study 3, and (8) that correlate similarly with other constructs (i.e., personality traits, life satisfaction, and affective wellbeing) as the total score of the subscale.</p><p>Second, one of the first authors developed definitions of the respective subscales. Next, one of the first authors and another researcher not involved in the present study independently rated the content validity of each item on a scale ranging from 1 = low content validity to 7 = high content validity regarding the following questions: (1) "How important is it that a certain item is kept to adequately capture the meaning of the subscale?", (2) "How important is an item to represent the content range of a subscale?".</p><p>Third, we followed the recommendation by <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Clark and Watson (2019)</ref> and additionally used item response theory for the process of item selection. We fitted a generalized partial credit model with the gpcm function of the ltm package <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">(Rizopoulos, 2006)</ref>. Next, we inspected the total item information as well as the descriptive item information curves. Items with higher total item information and peaks at different locations were favoured.</p><p>Finally, we applied ant-colony optimization with the antcolony.lavaan function of the ShortForm package <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Raborn, 2023)</ref> to inform the item selection. We used a measurement model with all eight subscales to have an overidentified model. Items were selected to optimize the model fit (CFI &gt; .95, TLI &gt; .95, RMSEA &lt; .06). We used ant-colony optimization with 60 ants as recommended by <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Olaru et al. (2019)</ref> and repeated the optimization procedure 10 times to inspect the robustness of the results.</p><p>All mentioned criteria were considered simultaneously to identify the first, second, and third best item within each factor. This procedure allowed to create a modular version with one to three items per perceived event characteristics, allowing researchers to choose the version that suits their research design best (e.g., the 1-item version for ESM studies). Detailed results on our item selection criteria can be found in the supplemental material. The final questionnaire assessing the eight perceived characteristics of daily events with one to three items is named Daily Event Questionnaire (DEQ) and can be accessed on OSF or in the Appendix.</p><p>Step 3: Confirmatory Factor Analysis and Psychometric Properties of the DEQ</p><p>We then examined the psychometric properties of the DEQ in an independent sample (data of Study 4). Our data analysis comprised several steps.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Internal Consistency</head><p>First, we computed scale scores for each of the eight perceived event characteristics and estimated McDonald's Omega and Cronbach's Alpha as indicators of internal consistency. The eight subscales of the DEQ showed good internal consistency with Omega ranging from 𝜔 =</p><p>.70 for the subscale threat to self to ω = .92 for the subscale positive emotion (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>, average Omega across characteristics: 𝜔 = .83). Considering the purpose of the DEQ, namely its use in daily diary and experience sampling research, the internal consistency can be considered as very good. The internal consistency of perceived characteristics of daily events (average alpha across characteristics: 𝛼 = .80) were higher than the internal consistency reported for situation perception (average alpha across characteristics: α = .64, <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Rauthmann et al., 2014)</ref> and similar to those of major life events (average alpha across characteristics: α = .85, <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Luhmann et al., 2021)</ref>. Note. All models showed an acceptable or good model fit except for the model of challenge, which showed a slight misfit in the RMSEA. Latent correlations between the perceived event characteristics assessed with the DEQ are reported in the supplemental material. a In the supplemental material, we also report the fit indices of a modified model for challenge with correlated residuals between two items. This model shows an acceptable model fit.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Factorial Validity</head><p>Second, we conducted a CFA with the cfa function from the lavaan package <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">(Rosseel, 2012)</ref> separately for each perceived characteristic. We set the factor loading of the latent first indicator to 1 and restricted the loadings of two items to be equal to achieve an over-identified model. To identify the two items whose loadings were set to be equal, we compared the fit of all possible models and reported the best-fitting model (acceptable: RMSEA ≤ .08 &amp; CFI/TLI ≥ .90; good: RMSEA ≤ .05, CFI/TLI ≥ .95; <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Hu &amp; Bentler, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Schermelleh-Engel et al., 2003)</ref>. Additionally, we tested a correlated factor model that included all eight perceived event characteristics (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>). The models for the perceived event characteristics relevance, threat to self, predictability, performance, sociality, and external control fit well (RMSEA ≤ .05 &amp; CFI/TLI ≥ .95). Regarding the perceived event characteristic challenge, the model showed a slight misfit in the RMSEA (RMSEA = .09) but good fit in CFI and TLI. Finally, the perceived event characteristic positive emotion and the multifactorial model with all eight perceived characteristics showed an acceptable model fit (RMSEA ≤ .08, CFI/TLI ≥ .90).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Convergent and Discriminant Validity</head><p>Third, to evaluate convergent and discriminant validity of the DEQ, we examined bivariate correlations between the subscales of the DEQ and the subscales of existing taxonomies of situations (DIAMONDS, <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Rauthmann et al., 2014)</ref> and major life events (ECQ; <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Luhmann et al., 2021)</ref>. More specifically, we defined the ECQ/DIAMONDS subscale as a construct to evaluate convergent validity if items of this subscale had items that overlapped in the respective DEQ subscale (e.g., the DEQ subscale positive emotion includes one item of the ECQ subscale valence)<ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">foot_1</ref> . To evaluate discriminant validity, we used the second highest correlation of the respective DEQ subscale with an ECQ/DIAMONDS subscale, which should be significantly smaller than the convergent correlation. We used the Hittner's test from the R package cocor <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Diedenhofen &amp; Musch, 2015)</ref> to compare the respective correlations. Eight out of 11 Hittner's tests indicated a significant difference between the convergent correlation and the highest discriminant correlation (see supplemental material for details). Regarding the three non-significant tests, the convergent correlation was descriptively higher than the discriminant correlation, but the difference was not statistically significant. Overall, the results indicate good convergent and discriminant validity of the DEQ-all perceived event characteristics assessed with the DEQ correlated highest with the conceptually closest perceived characteristic of major life events (ECQ) or situation characteristic (DIAMONDS).</p><p>Fourth, we conducted several linear regressions with the perceived event characteristics assessed with the DEQ as dependent variable and (1) the ECQ subscales, (2) the DIAMONDS subscales, or (3) the subscales of ECQ and DIAMONDS as predictors. The regression analysis of the DEQ subscales on either the ECQ or DIAMONDS showed that none of the existing taxonomies could fully account for all of the DEQ subscales (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>). However, the ECQ and DIAMONDS together could explain more than half of the variance in most of the DEQ subscales. Taken together, these findings suggest that none of the existing taxonomies alone is sufficient for assessing perceived characteristics of daily events. In contrast, a taxonomy combining relevant perceived event characteristics of situations and major life events seems necessary to holistically capture the perception of daily events, which is in line with the conceptualisation of daily events being located between situations and major life events (see Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). Note. The values in the brackets contain the results of the regression analyses after removing overlapping items (i.e., items that are part of the ECQ/DIAMONDS that were taken over into the DEQ subscale). The DEQ subscales relevance and predictability contain only items that were taken over from the ECQ.</p><p>Fifth, we investigated the average correlations of the DEQ subscales with other constructs (i.e., personality traits, life satisfaction, affective well-being, and depression) to examine the discriminant validity (Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref> and <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">5</ref>). In line with our predictions (at most medium-sized average correlations: r ≤ .20; Funder &amp; Ozer, 2019), we found small average correlations between the DEQ subscales and affective well-being (r = .14), depressive symptoms (r = .14), and personality traits (ranging from r = .04 for openness to r = .16 for neuroticism). For life satisfaction, the average correlation across the DEQ subscales was medium (r = .21), which was slighter higher than expected. Nonetheless, these findings suggest that the variance of perceived characteristics of daily events can neither be solely attributed to personality traits nor to well-being.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary</head><p>In Study 3 and 4, we developed a dimensional taxonomy of the perception of daily events (DE-8) that comprises eight subordinated dimensions: positive emotion, challenge, relevance, threat to self, predictability, duty, sociality, and external control (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">6</ref>).</p><p>Moreover, these eight perceived event characteristics can be assessed with the DEQ, which features good reliability, good factorial validity, and adequate discriminant and convergent validity. Due to its modular design the DEQ should be easily applicable to daily diary and experience sampling research, which we tested next.   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 5: Application in a Daily Diary Setting</head><p>Studies 3 and 4 provided initial evidence that the DEQ has good psychometric properties to assess the DE-8 as a comprehensive, dimensional taxonomy of perceived characteristics of daily events. However, both studies relied on cross-sectional data, leaving it unclear whether the DEQ is suitable to assess the perception of daily events in longitudinal data such as daily diary and experience sampling studies. Hence, the purpose of Study 5 was to examine the psychometric properties of the DEQ in a daily diary context and to test whether the perception of daily events can predict relevant outcomes such as well-being. Examining whether the perception of daily events can predict fluctuations in subjective well-being is theoretically and practically important to better understand individual differences in the reaction to daily events <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Luhmann et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b105">Sheldon et al., 2013)</ref>.</p><p>Study 5 had four aims. First, we sought to replicate and extend the reliability evidence for the DEQ by computing further reliability indicators such as test-retest reliability. Second, we examined whether the factor structure of the DEQ could be replicated in the daily diary data using multilevel confirmatory factor analysis (MLCFA). Third, to test the construct validity of the DEQ, we examined whether the perception of daily events and situations significantly differed from each other. Based on existing research and the conceptualization of daily events <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Luhmann et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Rauthmann &amp; Sherman, 2020)</ref>, we expected that daily events are, on average, perceived as more relevant, challenging, and self-threatening than situations (Hypotheses 1a to 1c). Fourth, to evaluate the predictive validity of the DEQ, we examined whether the perception of daily events could predict fluctuations in daily subjective well-being and whether the average perception of daily events across two weeks predicted changes in weekly and trait subjective well-being. Based on existing research on the relationship between the perception of major life events and subjective well-being <ref type="bibr">(Haehner, Kritzler, et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Haehner, Pfeifer, et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Luhmann et al., 2021)</ref>, we hypothesized that perceiving daily events as more challenging, more self-threatening, and less positive is related to lower subjective well-being on the same day and on the subsequent day (Hypothesis 2a to 2c).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants and Procedure</head><p>Participants for Study 5 were recruited using convenience sampling. People interested in the study first filled out a brief registration form including the provision of informed consent and were then invited to three trait assessments (T1 to T3), each 2 weeks apart, and a 2-week daily diary phase between T1 and T2 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3</ref>). At the trait assessments, participants answered questions about their weekly and trait subjective well-being as well as demographic characteristics. During the daily diary phase, participants received an email invitation to take part in brief daily diary surveys every evening. In these daily diary surveys, participants were asked to report the most important event they had experienced on that day and to rate their perception of this event using the DEQ as well as their daily subjective well-being. In the middle of the daily diary phase (i.e., one week after T1), participants additionally received an invitation to take part in a "week review". In this week review, participants re-rated their perception of the most important daily event they had experienced as well as the perception of the situation they were currently engaged in to compare the perception of daily events with the perception of everyday situations. The study included some additional measures that were not relevant for the present paper (see the study-design preregistration for details on all assessed variables).</p><p>Overall, N = 665 participants registered to take part in Study 5. However, we excluded data from measurement occasions where participants provided no or incorrect answers to our instructed response items (e.g., "To ensure data quality, please select the response option rather true"). Furthermore, we excluded participants who did not complete any daily diary assessment.</p><p>Applying these exclusion criteria led to a final sample size of N = 617 participants (499 females). Participants were on average 30.16 years old (SD = 9.89). Study Design of the Daily Diary Study Measures Trait Assessments. At T1 to T3, we assessed participants' life satisfaction and mood as indicators of subjective well-being. Life satisfaction was assessed with the 5-item Satisfaction</p><p>With Life Scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Diener et al., 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Glaesmer et al., 2011)</ref>. Items (e.g., "I am satisfied with my life") were assessed on a scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). We calculated mean scores for the analyses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mood was assessed with the German 6-item version of the Scale of Positive and</head><p>Negative Experiences <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Diener et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Rahm et al., 2017)</ref>. For each item (e.g., "happy"), participants indicated how often they felt a certain way in the last two weeks on a scale from 1 (very rarely or never) to 5 (very often or always). For the analyses, we coded all items in a way that higher scores indicated a more positive mood and calculated mean scores.</p><p>Daily-Diary Assessments. In the 2-week daily diary phase, participants rated their perception of the most important event of each day using the 3-item version of the DEQ with a total of 24 items (see Appendix). Items (e.g., "The event was exhausting") were rated on a scale from 1 (not true at all) to 5 (absolutely true). As the questionnaire consists of nested 1-to 3item versions per subscale, we calculated mean scores for the eight subscales of the DEQ based on one, two, or three items, respectively (see supplemental material for details).</p><p>Every evening, participants also rated their daily well-being using the German 6-item version of the Scale of Positive and Negative Experiences <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Diener et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Rahm et al., 2017)</ref>. Participants rated the items (e.g., "sad") regarding their mood at the present day from 1 (very rarely or never) to 5 (very often or always). For the analyses, we coded all items in a way that higher scores indicated higher well-being and calculated mean scores for each day.</p><p>Week Review and T3. At the week review and at the T3 follow-up, participants re-rated their perception of the most important event of the daily-dairy phase using the DEQ.</p><p>Furthermore, at the week review, participants rated their perception of the situation they were currently experiencing using the DEQ. To do so, the stem of the DEQ items was slightly changed (e.g., "The situation is exhausting" instead of "The event was exhausting."). The response scale, the instructions, and the calculation of scale scores were the same as in the daily diary assessments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Analysis</head><p>The analyses of Study 5 were conducted using R packages psych <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">(Revelle, 2024)</ref>, lavaan <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">(Rosseel, 2012)</ref>, and lmerTest <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Kuznetsova et al., 2017)</ref>. Our analyses consisted of four steps corresponding to the four goals of the daily diary study. If possible, the four steps were run separately for the 1-item, 2-item, and 3-item version of the DEQ. As we conducted most analyses separately for the eight perceived event characteristics, we used an adjusted level of significance of α = .05/8 = .006.</p><p>Step 1: Reliability. Using the daily diary data, data from the week review, and data from the follow-up assessment, we calculated different reliability indicators. First, we extracted Weighted Omega's based on MLCFAs, separately for the within-level and the between-level of the eight perceived event characteristics. Second, we computed McDonald's Omega and Cronbach's Alpha for the perceived event characteristics assessed at week reviews. Third, we examined test-retest reliability of the perceived event characteristics over up to one week and over up to one month based on participants' repeated ratings of their perception of the most important daily event of the daily diary period assessed at the week review and the follow-up assessment.</p><p>Step 2: Factorial Validity. We conducted MLCFAs to estimate the factorial validity of the perceived event characteristics while accounting for the nested data structure with assessments (Level 1) nested in participants (Level 2). We estimated separate MLCFAs for the eight perceived event characteristics. We restricted the loadings of two items to be equal to have an overidentified model with three items. As recommended by <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Ryu and West (2009)</ref>, we evaluated model fit separately at both levels based on RMSEA, CFI, and SRMR (acceptable:</p><p>RMSEA ≤ .08, CFI ≥ .90, SRMR ≤ .10; good: RMSEA ≤ .05, CFI ≥ .95, SRMR ≤ .05; <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Hu &amp; Bentler, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Schermelleh-Engel et al., 2003)</ref>.</p><p>Step 3: Construct Validity. To evaluate the construct validity of the DEQ, we examined whether the perception of daily events differed from the perception of situations. To do so, we used paired t tests comparing the average perception of situations and daily events based on the data of the week reviews.</p><p>Step 4: Predictive Validity. To examine whether the perception of daily events can predict fluctuations in subjective well-being, we conducted two sets of analyses. First, using daily diary data, we estimated multilevel models with daily diary assessments (Level 1) nested in participants (Level 2). In these multilevel models, daily well-being served as the dependent variable and perceived event characteristics served as predictors. As recommended by McNeish and Kelley (2019), we person-mean centered all perceived event characteristics to separate between-person and within-person effects. Specifically, these person-mean centered perceived event characteristics informed us whether deviations from one's average event perception were related to subjective well-being (contemporaneous within-person effect). Additionally, we included the person-means as Level-2 variables to the models indicating whether the average event perception of a person was related to subjective well-being (between-person effect).</p><p>Finally, we included a lagged perceived event characteristic in the model to gain a better understanding of the temporal unfolding of effects over time. To do so, we used person-mean centered perceived event characteristic of the previous day as predictor indicating whether the event perception of the previous day predicts the well-being at the next day (lagged withinperson effect). We included random slopes for all within-person predictors.</p><p>Second, we examined whether the average perception of daily events across all daily-diary assessments predicted changes in trait and weekly subjective well-being. To do so, we estimated multiple regression models using subjective well-being at T2 as dependent variable, and subjective well-being at T1 as predictor as well as the average perceived event characteristic as predictors. We repeated these analyses using subjective well-being assessed at T3 as dependent variable.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reliability</head><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">7</ref> summarizes the different reliability indicators for the DEQ. All perceived event characteristics had acceptable or good reliability. For example, for the 3-item version of the perceived event characteristics, the 1-week test-retest reliabilities ranged from r = .74 for relevance to r = .96 for positive emotion. Test-retest reliabilities were lower but still acceptable for most subscales when evaluating the 1-item and the 2-item versions of DEQ. Overall, these findings indicate that the DEQ can be used to reliably assess perceived event characteristics in daily diary studies. For all subscales except for perceived relevance, the 1-item and 2-item versions of the DEQ seem to be sufficient to achieve adequate reliability.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Factorial Validity</head><p>To examine whether the factor structure of the DEQ could be replicated in a daily diary context, we used MLCFAs. The measurement model of all subscales had an acceptable or good model fit (RMSEA ≤ .06, CFI &gt; .99, SRMR ≤ .02), supporting the factorial validity of the DEQ in longitudinal data. More details on these findings can be found in the supplemental material.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Construct Validity: Daily Event Perception Versus Situation Perception</head><p>To evaluate the construct validity of the DEQ, we examined whether the perception of daily events differs from the perception of situations. In line with our Hypotheses 1a to 1c, we found that daily events were on average perceived as more relevant, more challenging, and more self-threatening than situations (Table <ref type="table">8</ref>). Furthermore, daily events were also perceived as eliciting more positive emotions, more duty-related, more sociable, more externally controlled, and less predictable. The sizes of these mean-level differences ranged from medium effects (d = 0.24 for threat to self) to very large effects (d = 1.25 for relevance) <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Funder &amp; Ozer, 2019)</ref>, supporting the claim that daily events can be conceptually distinguished from situations.</p><p>Particularly the finding that daily events are perceived as more relevant than situations is consistent with our conceptualization of daily events (see Figure <ref type="figure">1A</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Predictive Validity: Does the Perception of Daily Events Predict Fluctuations in Subjective</head><p>Well-Being?</p><p>To evaluate whether the perception of daily events can predict fluctuations in subjective well-being, we first estimated multilevel models with daily diary assessments nested in participants. In these models, we included a between-person effect, a within-person contemporaneous effect, and a within-person lagged effect of the perceived event characteristics. The results are summarized in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">9</ref>. In line with Hypotheses 2a and 2c, we found that perceiving daily events as more self-threatening and less positive was related to lower subjective well-being on the same day (threat to self: b = -0.44, p &lt; .001; positive emotion: b = 0.34, p &lt; .001) and on the subsequent day (threat to self: b = -0.06, p = .001; positive emotion: b = 0.03, p &lt; .001). In contrast, only partly in line with Hypothesis 2b, we found that perceived challenge was related to lower subjective well-being only at the same day (b = -0.28, p &lt; .001) but not at the subsequent day (b = -0.02, p = .013). Importantly, the results were similar when using the 2-item and the 1-item version of the DEQ, suggesting that these short scales can also predict changes in subjective well-being (see the supplemental material for details).</p><p>To investigate whether the perception of daily events can also predict more lasting changes in subjective well-being, we examined whether the aggregated perception of daily events across the daily diary phase can predict fluctuations in well-being over two to four weeks. The results are summarized in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">10</ref>. In line with our findings on daily well-being, we found that perceiving events as more challenging, more self-threatening, and less positive was consistently related to a decrease in subjective well-being over two to four weeks.</p><p>Furthermore, we found that a higher average sociality rating of daily events predicted an increase in mood over two to four weeks. Again, these results were similar when using the 1item and the 2-item version of the DEQ (see supplemental material).</p><p>In summary, our findings suggest that the perception of daily events can predict fluctuations in subjective well-being. They thus provide initial evidence for the utility of the perception of daily events for advancing our understanding of why the effects of daily events differ across people. Overall, our findings are consistent with existing evidence on the perception of major life events supporting the relevance of the perceived event characteristics sociality, positivity, challenge, and threat to self when examining changes in well-being <ref type="bibr">(Haehner, Kritzler, et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Haehner, Pfeifer, et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Luhmann et al., 2021)</ref>. Note. Reliabilities of all perceived event characteristics were at least acceptable (&gt; .70) with a few exceptions for perceived relevance of daily events.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Discussion</head><p>Daily events are of critical relevance for personality science as they predict fluctuations in important outcomes like well-being, mediate the effects of major life events on these outcomes, and act as an outcome of stress-generation processes <ref type="bibr">(Haehner &amp; Bleidorn, 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Nezlek et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Ringwald et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b105">Sheldon et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b113">Vize et al., 2023)</ref>. To better understand the effects of daily events, it is important to assess them in a way that aligns with their theoretical conceptualization and that allows capturing individual differences in how people perceive daily events. This requires a clear conceptualization of the perception of daily events as well as a validated instrument to assess the perception. With the present article, we aimed to come closer to a fulfilment of these requirements. First, we developed a taxonomy of perceived characteristics of daily events (Studies 1 to 4), which was based on existing research and theory on daily events, taxonomies of the perception of major life events and situations, and a qualitative study. The final taxonomy (DE-8) includes eight dimensions of the perception of daily events: positive emotion, challenge, relevance, threat to self, predictability, duty, sociality, and external control. Second, we developed a questionnaire, the Daily Event Questionnaire (DEQ), that allows assessing these eight perceived event characteristics reliably and validly (Studies 4 to 5). Third, we demonstrated that daily event perception can predict fluctuations in subjective well-being and thus advances our understanding of individual differences in the reaction to daily events (Study 5). In the following, we discuss the content of our taxonomy, its relationship to taxonomies of major life events and situations, and how the DE-8 and the DEQ can advance psychological research and theory development on daily events.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Perception of Daily Events</head><p>As illustrated in the systematic literature review (Study 1), perceived characteristics were considered in 71% of the articles on daily events. However, most studies only used a single event characteristic to assess the perception of daily events-without a theoretical or empirical justification. Moreover, the terminology for perceived characteristics of daily events that were similar in content differed remarkably across studies (also known as the jingle-jangle fallacy; <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Kelley, 1927)</ref>. The newly developed taxonomy with eight perceived event characteristics can help to organize existing research on daily events as well as inspire future research on daily events by revealing perceived characteristics of daily events that have been overlooked so far.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Perceived Characteristics of Daily Events</head><p>Overall, we extracted eight perceived characteristics of daily events. The dimensions of positive emotion (e.g., "The event was positive") and challenge (e.g., "The event was burdensome") refer to the valence and negative emotional consequences of daily events.</p><p>Valence is the most frequently studied perceived characteristic of daily events in previous research and existing research supports the relevance of this perceived event characteristic to understand changes in subjective well-being <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(McCullough et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Mroczek &amp; Almeida, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Newman &amp; Nezlek, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b113">Vize et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b123">Zheng et al., 2023)</ref>. However, as some daily events like being in a meeting or coming second place may contain both positive and negative aspects, considering positive and negative emotions as separate event characteristics may help to fully understand the experience of daily events <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">(Rauthmann et al., 2014)</ref>.</p><p>However, the results from Study 1 to Study 5 indicate that, in addition to positive emotion and challenge, other characteristics play also an important role in the perception of daily events. First, the perceived event characteristic relevance (e.g., "The event had impact on my life") describes the extent to which the event affected the life of the person who experienced the event. Only a few studies considered a dimension similar to relevance, although there is first evidence that the perceived relevance of daily events does indeed matter: For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">McIntyre et al. (2008)</ref> found that the perceived relevance of hassles significantly predicted stress, even when controlling for perceived challenge. Importantly, the DEQ characteristic relevance does not exclusively focus on the negative effects of daily events since the disruption of the daily routine through the daily event can be equally applied to positive and negative daily events.</p><p>Second, the dimension predictability (e.g., "The event occurred suddenly") describes the extent to which the daily event was anticipated by the person who experienced the event.</p><p>Similar to relevance, predictability of events was rarely considered in previous research on daily events (i.e., only in one study identified in the systematic review). Considering this event characteristic may nonetheless be important as, for example, the Hedonic Adaption Prevention</p><p>Model by <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">Sheldon et al. (2013)</ref> suggests that unpredictable positive daily events bolster wellbeing, which could be further investigated by examining the effects of daily events with high positive emotion and low predictability.</p><p>Third, the dimension sociality (e.g., "During the event, close personal relationships were important or could develop") describes the extent to which a daily event included social interactions. Although this perceived characteristic has not yet been considered in research on daily events, including this dimension is in line with situation research emphasizing the importance of sociality (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Rauthmann et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Reis, 2008)</ref>. The perceived sociality of daily events can influence a person's behaviour and could predict changes in social relationships beyond the experienced daily event. Moreover, the sociality dimension might be useful if researchers are particularly interested in outcomes on the dyadic level, such as relationship satisfaction, or even when researchers want to investigate loneliness (e.g., are changes in the frequency of daily events with high levels of sociality associated with changes in loneliness).</p><p>Fourth, the dimension duty (e.g., "During the event, a job had to be done") describes the extent to which a person had the feeling they had to perform during the daily event. Similar to sociality, duty is a perceived characteristic that has primarily been considered in situation research <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">(Rauthmann et al., 2014)</ref>. In the context of daily events, duty can encompass a variety of different tasks, such as duties one must fulfil for work (e.g., handing in a manuscript until a deadline), duties that must be done in the household (e.g., cleaning the bathroom), or duties regarding your social roles (e.g., picking up your children from school). <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Horstmann et al. (2019)</ref> found that perceived duty can be associated with either increased positive or increased negative affect, depending on the valence of the situation. Similarly, daily events with high levels of duty might be related to desirable or undesirable changes in affect, depending on the positive or negative emotion of the daily event.</p><p>Fifth, the dimension threat to self (e.g., "I was criticized during the event") describes the extent to which a person thought that their reputation or their self-esteem suffered through the daily event. <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">Tomaka et al. (1993)</ref> found that higher perceived threat of a situation leads to higher stress levels, physiological effects (e.g., elevated heart rate), and behavioural effects (i.e., poorer task performance). Similarly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Almeida et al. (2002)</ref> found that higher levels of threat in daily events were associated with physical symptoms and negative mood.</p><p>Sixth, the dimension external control (e.g., "Others were responsible for the event")</p><p>describes the extent to which other factors outside the person who experienced the daily event caused the daily event. Studies investigating the relevance of controllability of daily events on psychological outcomes are rare. However, <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Peeters et al. (1995)</ref> found that lower levels of perceived control predicted predicted higher levels of negative affect. Moreover, research on major life events suggests that perceived control of events does matter: <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Haehner, Pfeifer, et al. (2023)</ref> showed that changes in perceived control are associated with changes in life satisfaction.</p><p>In summary, the DE-8 taxonomy of eight perceived characteristics of daily events provides a systematic approach to the assessment of daily events, going beyond the frequently studied characteristics of stressfulness or valence. Considering multiple dimensions of event perception may help to gain a more holistic understanding of the subjective experience of daily events and thus advance our understanding of individual differences in response to daily events.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Similarities With and Differences to Situations and Major Life Events</head><p>As the DE-8 taxonomy was informed by existing research on situations and major life events, it shows similarities and differences to the perception of situations (DIAMONDS: <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Rauthmann et al., 2014)</ref> or major life events (ECQ: <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Luhmann et al., 2021)</ref>. The differentiation between content characteristics, style characteristics, and consequence-focused characteristics can help to understand similarities and differences between those taxonomies and thus the conceptualization of the underlying environmental experiences <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Luhmann et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>The DE-8, DIAMONDS, and ECQ taxonomies all contain style characteristics. Style characteristics are descriptive attributes of life experiences irrespective of their content. For instance, the characteristics positive emotion, challenge, external control, and predictability of the DE-8 could be considered as such style characteristics. While the former two overlap with both situation taxonomies and taxonomies of major life events, the latter two were primarily adopted from research on major life events <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Luhmann et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Rauthmann et al., 2014)</ref>.</p><p>However, other style characteristics such as extraordinariness are not included in the DE-8, which aligns with the fact that daily events and situations are experienced more frequently than major life events (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>).</p><p>In contrast to situation taxonomies such as the DIAMONDS, the DE-8 taxonomy further includes consequence-focused characteristics, namely threat to self and relevance. Although these characteristics are conceptually similar to the perceived characteristics impact and social status change found in research on major life events <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Luhmann et al., 2021)</ref>, they capture a lower intensity of these consequences. While perceived impact, for example, refers to changes in social or professional roles and lasting changes in people's lives, perceived relevance of the DE-8 captures the temporary influences of daily events on daily life.</p><p>Finally, in contrast to the perception of major life events, the DEQ includes two content characteristics, duty and sociality, which are very similar to the respective DIAMONDS dimensions. These content characteristics describe what the event is about <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Rauthmann, 2015)</ref> and are relevant because they can predict fluctuations in relevant outcomes, such as well-being (Study 5).</p><p>In summary, the DE-8 taxonomy of the perception of daily events overlaps with taxonomies of the perception of major life events and situations. Given that situations, daily events, and life events all refer to relevant life experiences, it is not surprising that these taxonomies share similarities. However, having a clear concept of the relation of these dimensions across taxonomies will help to compare, distinguish, and possibly even integrate findings across these different life experiences. The findings of the present article thus help to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the nomological net of the perception of daily events (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4</ref>). The Nomological Net of the Perception of Daily Events Note. The Figure displays the nomological net of the perception of daily events. Black displayed aspects of the figure were examined in the present study (e.g., how characteristics of daily events predict changes in well-being), grey aspects remain a task for future research on the perception of daily events (e.g., how person characteristics, such as personality traits, contribute to the experience of daily events).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Role of (the Perception of) Daily Events in Personality Psychology</head><p>Considering the subjective perception of daily events on multiple dimensions, as assessed with the DEQ, can advance research on daily events and person-environmental transactions in multiple ways (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3</ref>). First, the perception of daily events can help to predict psychological outcomes, such as subjective well-being (see Study 5). In line with our hypotheses, we found that perceiving daily events as less positive and more self-threatening was related to lower subjective well-being on the next day. These results generally align with previous findings on daily events, but also allow for a more differentiated understanding by showing which aspects or perceived characteristics of daily events relate to well-being (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">McCullough et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b123">Zheng et al., 2023)</ref>. Furthermore, we found that the average perception (e.g., the average level of positive emotion or threat to self) of daily events across 2 weeks was related to changes in subjective well-being over up to four weeks. These findings suggest that studying the perception of daily events over time is a promising approach for predicting relevant outcome variables. However, further research is needed to investigate over what period the perception of daily events should be aggregated for optimal predictive power. Moreover, it remains a task for future research to examine if these effects extend to other outcome variables (e.g., mental health or personality traits) and whether the same perceived characteristics are equally relevant for different outcomes.</p><p>Second, the consideration of the perception of daily events can help to better understand daily events as mediators or outcome variables in psychological research. Contemporary theories in personality psychology suggest that daily events mediate the influence of major life events on relevant outcome variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">(Sheldon et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b120">Wrzus &amp; Roberts, 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Considering the subjective perception of daily events would allow to test if the experience of a major life event entails the experience of subsequent daily events with a similar profile of perceived event characteristics. However, to better understand the complex interplay of those environmental experiences, longitudinal studies assessing the perception of major life events as well as daily events in combination with relevant outcome variables would be necessary.</p><p>Moreover, the consideration of perceived characteristics of daily events can lead to a better understanding of the stress generation process. There is initial evidence suggesting that perceived characteristics of situations and major life events relate to personal characteristics like personality traits <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Horstmann et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Rakhshani et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b106">Sherman et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Examining the relationship between these personal characteristics and the perception of daily events can provide a more nuanced understanding of the outcomes of stress generation processes-for example, whether there are specific links between personal characteristics and hassles that are perceived in a certain way <ref type="bibr">(Haehner &amp; Bleidorn, 2024)</ref>. However, it should be noted that those potential person-environment transactions are not limited to negative effects, such as stress generation, but should also be investigated for positive events.</p><p>Furthermore, the DEQ leads to new research questions. For instance, it is an open question if certain patterns of perceived event characteristics occur often in combination, resulting in distinct profiles of different daily events. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Kritzler et al. (2023)</ref> found distinct perception profiles for different types of major life events. However, within a specific category of a major life event (e.g., a breakup), participants still showed substantial variance in their perception-indicating the necessity to assess the individual perception of environmental experiences. Relatedly, the DEQ allows to examine similarities and differences in the perception of daily events-within and across different event types-and how this relates to changes in relevant outcome variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Haehner, Rakhshani, et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Kritzler et al., 2023)</ref>.</p><p>Finally, dimensionally assessing the perception of daily events could be used to examine intraindividual changes in the event perception <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Haehner et al., 2022)</ref>. It could, for example, be the case that the perception of a daily event changes over time and that these changes predict changes in important outcome variables.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations</head><p>The present set of studies had several limitations. First, the DEQ was developed and validated in samples from <ref type="bibr">Western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic (WEIRD, Henrichs et al., 2010)</ref> societies. It is thus an open question if participants from other societies experience qualitatively different daily events, choose other daily events to report, or perceive them differently. However, <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Guillaume et al. (2016)</ref> compared the experience of situations in the morning in 20 countries and found rather similar experiences across countries. Hence, we would expect similar results for the experience of daily events-but this remains an empirical question.</p><p>To test this, similar research should be carried out in other cultures.</p><p>Second, participants completed the 3-item version of the DEQ in all studies. To test the psychometric properties for the short and extra-short version of the DEQ (i.e., version with 1 and with 2 items per characteristic), reduced sets of items were analysed-but these reduced sets were not assessed independently. However, if fewer items are presented, this may lead participants to react differently <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Drolet &amp; Morrison, 2001)</ref>. Future studies are therefore needed to further evaluate the psychometric properties of the 1-and 2-item version of the DEQ in different settings.</p><p>Third, the relevance of perceived characteristics of daily events was only illustrated for one outcome, namely subjective well-being. This illustrates the potential of the DEQ, but generalization to other constructs requires further empirical evidence. Future researchers should investigate which perceived event characteristic is relevant for which outcome, thereby extending its nomological net. Additionally, all studies were correlational, precluding strong causal claims. The results of the longitudinal Study 5 and the fact that the results of perceived event characteristics on well-being are theoretically plausible, encourage further research on the causal relationships between these variables. Therefore, an experimental set-up in which daily events with certain properties are experimentally induced (e.g., daily events high in sociality or positive emotion) would allow to gain further certainty in the causal relationship between perceived event characteristics and relevant outcome variables (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">Sheldon et al., 2013</ref>, for a similar approach).</p><p>Fourth, in the present study, the perception of daily events was assessed via self-reports.</p><p>However, future research on the perception of daily events should ideally assess perceived characteristics of daily events as well as criterion variables, such as well-being, from various sources. For example, informants (e.g., friends, colleagues, or family members of the person who experienced the daily event) or the assessment of biomarkers (e.g., cortisol as a biomarker of stress) might provide further insights into the perception of daily events and the consequences beyond the self-report measure <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Fliedner &amp; Horstmann, 2024)</ref>.</p></div>
