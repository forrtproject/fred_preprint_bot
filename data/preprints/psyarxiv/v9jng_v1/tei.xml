<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Peer influence is one of the controversial matters since adolescents are more likely to be susceptible to it during this developmental period. We examined how adolescents are influenced by the prosocial and antisocial decisions of peers with different knowledge-based statuses (high and low) in SOCIAL STATUS AND CONFORMITY IN ADOLESCENCE public and private contexts, as well as to assess whether personality and gender play a role. 132 boys, and 139 girls (M = 17, SD = 1.495) were randomly assigned to one of the four conditions of a 2x2 combination of the confederate's decision and status factors. Each adolescent filled out the NEO_FFI personality scale and then participated in a two-part experiment with seven virtual confederates. In the first part, to manipulate the knowledge-based social status, participants completed the Quantitative Estimation task. Then, adolescents participated in a modified Public Goods Game to measure conformity towards high and low-status decisions in public and private contexts. Results indicated that adolescents tended to conform more to high-status peers rather than low-status ones, particularly in prosocial decisions over antisocial decisions. Interestingly, girls showed more conformity to low-status peers in public prosocial decisions, while boys tended to conform to high-status peers and internalize the influence privately. High-status individuals were influential in getting adolescents to internalize antisocial behavior, even without public acknowledgment.</p><p>Personality traits such as Agreeableness and Extraversion also played a role in conforming behaviors. Overall, the findings suggest that leveraging the influence of high-status peers could help in promoting prosocial behavior and discouraging free-riding among adolescents in social decision-making contexts.</p></div>

Such decisions can lead to the exhaustion of communal resources <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Hardin, 1968)</ref>, and lower life satisfaction for the decision-makers themselves <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Krekels &amp; Pandelaere, 2015)</ref>. However, despite their significance, prosocial and antisocial conformity dynamics within the group setting remain relatively unexplored <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Panizza et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Nook et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Batson, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Van Hoorn et al., 2014)</ref>. Individuals' conformity levels vary significantly depending on the status of those they interact with. Research consistently demonstrates that individuals tend to conform more when interacting with individuals of higher status compared to those of lower status <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Shi &amp; Xie, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Cohen &amp; Prinstein, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Anderson et al., 2015)</ref>. Social conformity to high-status others not only reduces the likelihood of rejection <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Gommans et al.,2017)</ref>, but also fosters increased approval, and strengthens social bonds <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Cohen &amp; Prinstein, 2006)</ref>. However, the determinants of status within a group are multifaceted, and it remains unclear whether all factors lead to higher conformity. Knowledge as a valuable acquired ability, holds potential as a significant contributor to status dynamics. Interactions with knowledgeable individuals can provide access to resources and guidance, facilitating more informed and successful decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Bunderson, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Kurschilgen &amp; Marcin, 2019)</ref>. However, despite its potential impact, previous studies have largely overlooked the influence of knowledge as a source of status on prosocial and antisocial conformity, a gap that this study aims to address.</p><p>Previous studies on prosocial and antisocial conformity often overlooked its dual nature, encompassing both public and private forms.</p><p>Public conformity occurs when individuals align with a person or group norm for the sake of congruency without genuinely holding those beliefs <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Deutsch &amp; Gerard, 1955;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Sowden et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Abrams et al., 1990)</ref>.</p><p>Conversely, private conformity entails adopting others' beliefs even when they are not present or not aware of the individual's beliefs, mainly driven by the perception of correctness or ambiguity <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Sherif, 1936;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Abrams et al., 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Deutsch &amp; Gerard, 1955;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Sowden et al., 2018)</ref>. This duality raises questions about the interplay between knowledge-based status and both prosocial and antisocial conformity. Does knowledge-based status predominantly influence public conformity, where individuals conform outwardly to maintain social congruence or does it shape private conformity, where internal alignment with others' beliefs occurs regardless of social context? Age represents a critical determinant shaping the dynamics of social conformity, with adolescence standing out as a particularly susceptible stage marked by profound biological and developmental changes.</p><p>Adolescents, in particular, are known for their heightened susceptibility to external influences, often exhibiting contradictory responses due to the myriad changes occurring during this phase. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Foulkes et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Christie &amp; Viner, 2005)</ref>. While adolescents are commonly perceived as highly influenced by their peers <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Meehan et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Schriber &amp; Guyer, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Cohen &amp; Prinstein, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Helms et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Brechwald &amp; Prinstein, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Juvonen &amp; Ho, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Prinstein et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Choukas-Bradley et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Chierchia et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Molleman et al., 2022)</ref>, their reactions to peer social hierarchy and status can vary significantly, influenced by factors such as the nature of observed behaviors (i.e., prosocial or antisocial behaviors), gender, and individual personality traits.</p><p>For instance, studies have revealed nuanced patterns in genderspecific conformity behaviors among adolescents. While some evidence suggests that girls tend to conform to both high and low-status individuals in terms of prosocial behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Choukas-Bradley et al., 2015)</ref>, conflicting findings indicate that girls may avoid interactions with high-status peers due to their sense of resentment, as high-status individuals are perceived as likely to reject peers of lower status <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Eder, 1985)</ref>. There has also been some evidence reporting that girls exhibit a propensity to conform to averagestatus peers <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Lansu &amp; Karremans, 2015)</ref>. Conversely, research suggests that boys tend to conform more to high-status peers across both antisocial and prosocial behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Choukas-Bradley et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Cohen &amp; Prinstein, 2006)</ref> and may even avoid behaving similarly to low-status peers to assert their independence <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Cohen &amp; Prinstein., 2006)</ref>. Despite these observations, conflicting findings persist regarding adolescents' conformity to high versus low-status peers, irrespective of gender <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Gommans et al., 2017)</ref>. Personality factors emerge as potential explanatory carriable for these discrepancies. <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Wijenayake et al. (2020)</ref> showed that individuals with higher scores in Neuroticism and Conscientiousness are more prone to conformity. On the other hand, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">DeYoung et al. (2002)</ref> have reported that agreeableness, emotional stability, and conscientiousness are positively related to conformity, while extraversion and openness, are linked to non-conformity. These characteristics can significantly influence individuals' attitudes toward managing behavioral differences in social contexts, shaping their inclination to either conform and avoid challenges or express themselves and assert independence rather than simply following others. Consequently, individuals of different genders and personality types may exhibit varying patterns of conformity to highly knowledgeable peers in both prosocial and antisocial scenarios, with potential differences emerging in both public and private conformity. Thus, it is crucial to investigate how peers of varying status influence different forms of conformity in both prosocial and antisocial contexts across different genders and personality types.</p><p>In the present study, we aimed to investigate how knowledge-based social status affects public and private conformity to prosocial and antisocial decision-making among adolescents. Additionally, we sought to explore the role of gender and personality traits in this effect. To this purpose, we designed a study comprising a knowledge-based contest followed by a modified public goods game <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Holt &amp; Laury, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Meehan et al., 2022)</ref>. The knowledge-based contest was used to manipulate the knowledge-based status of the participants, as well as their confederates.</p><p>Next, during the PGG they were presented with another participant's donation, allowing us to examine the influence of others' behavior on the participant. Participants were asked to announce their donations publicly and privately, allowing us to assess both public and private conformity. The study employed a between-subject design, manipulating the confederate's knowledge-based status (high and low) and decision (prosocial and antisocial). Additionally, we considered the gender composition of the group, which could be either all girls or all boys, and participants' personality traits, assessed using the NEO-FFI <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Costa &amp; McCrae, 1992)</ref> questionnaire (see Figure <ref type="figure">1A</ref>). While we had complete control over the first three factors (status, confederate decision, and social context) gender and personality were incidentally determined through the random process of participant recruitment. We formulated four main predictions for this study.</p><p>First, we predicted that participants would conform more to those with higher knowledge-based status, particularly when the confederate engages in prosocial behavior. However, we had no specific hypothesis regarding the effect of confederate's antisocial behavior on conformity. Second, we hypothesized that participants' public and private conformity would differ, with private conformity expected to be higher than public conformity for antisocial conditions. Third, we expected gender differences in conformity, with girls hypothesized to conform less to individuals of higher status. Finally, based on previous studies that suggested higher scores in Extraversion and Openness personality domains to be associated with showing less conformity due to their inclination towards creativity and advocacy of new ideas <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Deyoung et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Oyibo &amp; Vassileva, 2019)</ref>, we sought to explore the personality correlates of conformity among adolescents. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures NEO Five-Factor Inventory</head><p>Originally developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Costa and McCrae (1992)</ref>, the NEO-Five-Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI) is a short form of NEO PI-R, consisting of 60 items evenly distributed among five personality domains of Neuroticism, Extraversion, Openness to experiences, Agreeableness, and Conscientiousness. Items are responded to on a five-point Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree, 5 = strongly agree). The validated Farsi version of NEO-FFI used in this study <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Garusi, 1998)</ref> is shown to provide good reliability with Cronbach's alpha of . <ref type="bibr">83, .75, .80, .79, and .79</ref> for Neuroticism, Extraversion, Openness to experience, Agreeableness, and Conscientiousness, respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Manipulation of Social Status</head><p>An estimation task was used to manipulate participants' perceived hierarchy based on general knowledge. similar to previous studies manipulating social hierarchy, participants were informed that they would compete against seven others in answering eight estimation questions, with responses evaluated based on both accuracy and speed <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Mehta et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Zink et al., 2008)</ref>. To ensure challenging yet feasible questions, participants were presented with queries where finding the exact answer was improbable but reasonable estimations were possible <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Lorenz et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Mavrodiev et al., 2012)</ref>. For instance, participants were asked to estimate the number of pens needed to cover the length of a passenger train wagon, assuming an infinite supply of pens with standard length. Each question was answered on a slider ranging from 0 to 1000, with participants given 30 seconds to respond. After each question feedback was provided regarding the participants ranking (Figure <ref type="figure">1B</ref>). Subsequently, participants were asked two questions: 1) who ranked first? and 2) who ranked last? The idea behind using these questions was twofold. First, it was used as an attention check.</p><p>Second, to draw participants' attention to the repetition of two virtual confederates who ranked first and last 75% of the time during the eight rounds. Additionally, participants found themselves ranked third and fifth three times each, as well as second and fourth once, maintaining an intermediate rank throughout. Following the eight rounds, participants were presented with the final ranking based on total points, where they were consistently ranked fourth. This ranking system was utilized a means to represent each participant's social status based on general knowledge.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Modified Public Goods Game</head><p>Participants engaged in a modified repeated public goods game (PGG) with feedback provided on each round. They were informed that they would play 10 rounds of PGG with the same individuals as in the preceding estimation task (Figure <ref type="figure">1C</ref>). As in the original version of PGG, participants were endowed with a fixed amount of money on each round (50 tokens) and tasked with allocating those tokens between themselves and the public pot.</p><p>They were also informed that the total amount contributed to the public pot would be tripled, and redistributed among participants. However, some modifications were also made. Participants were instructed to choose two numbers from a set of 11 options ranging from 0 to 50 <ref type="bibr">(0, 5, 10, 15, …, 50)</ref> in each round. First, they had to determine how much they wanted to donate (private donation), and then irrespective of how much they had donated they had to report a number to others as their donation (Public declaration of donation). They were free to choose two completely different numbers (e.g., donating nothing and reporting that they have donated 50 participants were assured that their private donation would remain confidential and other participants would be blind to that. However, at the end of each round, one participant would be selected randomly, and his/her public declaration of donation would be shown to others.</p><p>Based on the between-subject design of the study, each participant was assigned to one of the four different conditions of the game, namely prosocial-1, prosocial-8, antisocial-1, and antisocial-8 (where prosocial/antisocial refers to the confederate's decision that was selected to be presented publicly to others, and 1/8 refers to the rank of the two specific confederates in estimation task that represent high and low knowledge-based status). The public declaration of donation of a confederate was manipulated based on the condition and was shown to the participants at the end of the first round. Those in the prosocial-1 condition received feedback indicating that the high-status confederate had declared to donate 50, whereas those in the antisocial-1 condition were informed that the high-status confederate had declared to donate zero. On the other hand, those in prosocial-8 and antisocial-8 conditions received feedback reflecting that the low-status confederate had declared to donate 50 or zero respectively (see Figure <ref type="figure">1C</ref>). This setup was designed to determine the extent to which participants' donations were influenced by and aligned with the public choices of the confederates, contingent upon their status and decision. Since the feedback on public declaration of donation was provided after each round, participants' private and public declaration of donation in the first round were independent of the feedback, and thus were used as the baseline measurement of how much they are inclined to cooperate. However, their donations in the second round were considered to be biased by the feedback they received. Hence, we used the following formula to calculate the degree of conformity based on private and public declarations of donation separately:</p><p>In the numerator there is, where , and represent donations of the second, and first round of the task respectively. This is divided by in the denominator, where stands for the confederate's public declaration of donation, and , again, stands for the first round of donation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure</head><p>Upon recruitment, participants were provided with a four-minute video outlining basic instructions for the task and a link to the NEO-FFI questionnaire, which they were requested to fill out before the scheduled experiment time. Moreover, since the study was conducted online, participants were prompted to provide necessary information such as their date of birth, gender, name, and email address for registration on the experimental platform. Participants were informed that experimental SOCIAL STATUS AND CONFORMITY IN ADOLESCENCE sessions would be held in groups of eight, and they would engage in a simultaneous online quantitative estimation task alongside seven samegender peers. In reality, however, they played against computerized agents (confederates). Upon accessing the site, each participant was tasked with selecting a letter from the remaining four out of eight letters within 60 seconds, which would serve as their identifier throughout the experiment. Subsequently, they waited for the arrival of other participants for 10 seconds before receiving task instructions. Following this, participants engaged in a half-hour experiment that comprised two parts.</p><p>In the first part, the estimation task was conducted to manipulate social status and hierarchy based on general knowledge, priming participants for the subsequent phase. In the second part of the task, the participants engaged in a modified public goods game (PGG) based on their ranking from the knowledge estimation task, divided into four different conditions: prosocial-1, prosocial-8, antisocial-1, and antisocial-8. Each condition exposed participants to specific public declarations of donation from confederates, reflecting different social dynamics. Prosocial-1 exposed participants to the public declaration of the high-status confederate's donation. Prosocial-8 exposed participants to the public declaration of the low-status confederate's donation. Antisocial-1 exposed participants to the antisocial public declaration of the high-status confederate's donation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SOCIAL STATUS AND CONFORMITY IN ADOLESCENCE</head><p>Antisocial-8, which exposed participants to the antisocial public declaration of the low-status confederate's donation. Following completion of the task, participants filled out a three-item questionnaire regarding their perceptions based on the final ranking. Analysis of this data is beyond the scope of this study and it will be used for another study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical Analysis</head><p>First, one sample t-test was used to investigate whether participants' decisions were influenced by the knowledge-based status of the confederate (conformity in each condition vs zero). To examine the effect of the confederate's status (high and low) and participant's gender on both private and public conformity in prosocial and antisocial conditions, four separate two-way analyses of variance (Status × Gender) were conducted. Independent sample t-test was also used as the post-hoc analysis. Moreover, the Pearson correlation was used to assess the relationship between personality variables and public and private conformity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>:</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Effects of Confederate's Knowledge-Based Status, Condition (Prosocial/Antisocial), and Context (Public/Private) on Conformity</head><p>A three-way ANOVA was conducted to examine the impact of the confederate's knowledge-based status (high and low), condition (prosocial and antisocial), and context (public and private) on conformity. Our results indicated a significant main effect of the confederate's status, F (1, 236) = 5.600, p = .019, η p 2 = .023. Post-hoc analysis revealed that conformity towards a high-status confederate (M = .161, SD = .627) was significantly higher than towards a low-status confederate (M = .028, SD = .675).</p><p>Additionally, there was a significant interaction between condition (prosocial/antisocial) and context (public and private), [F (1, 236) = 5.659, p = .018, η p 2 = .023]. To further explore this interaction, a post-hoc comparison using a Bonferroni correction was conducted. It was revealed that antisocial private conformity was significantly higher than antisocial public conformity (t= 2.225, p = .027), whereas prosocial public conformity was significantly higher than antisocial public conformity, (t = 2.725, p = .007; see Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>). No other main or interaction effect was significant (All ps &gt; .05; see Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>). Thus, we continued our analyses concerning our hypothesis on the moderating effect of gender and evaluated the effect of status and gender on conformity in different conditions.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Public/Private Conformity</head><p>A two-way ANOVA was conducted to assess the effects of the confederate's knowledge-based status (high and. low) and participant's gender (girls or boys) on public or private conformity based on the confederate's decision (prosocial/antisocial) through the PGG task.</p><p>Investigating public conformity in prosocial conditions, neither the main participant's gender nor the confederate's status was significant. However, we found a significant interaction between the confederate's status, and the participant's gender [F (1,135) = 4.726, p = .031, η p 2 = .035]. To further explore this interaction, a post-hoc analysis was conducted (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A</ref>). It was found that there was a significant difference in the effect of participants' gender and the confederate's status in the prosocial condition (F (1, 66) = .011, p = .023). Boys showed higher public conformity to the high-status confederate (M prosocial-1 = .279, SD prosocial-1 = .387) compared to the low-status confederate (M prosocial-8 = .051, SD prosocial-8 = .421). However, this difference was not observed in girls.</p><p>Furthermore, concerning private conformity within prosocial conditions, no significant effect was found for participant's gender, confederate's status, or their interaction (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3B</ref>).</p><p>Similarly, concerning public conformity within antisocial conditions, no significant effect was found for participant's gender, confederate's status, or the interaction of factors (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4A</ref>).</p><p>Finally, we found a significant effect of confederate's status [F (1,105) = 3.996, p = .048, η p 2 = .038] on private conformity in antisocial condition, while the main effect of participant's gender and the interaction were not significant. In order to further investigate the main effect, a post-hoc analysis was conducted (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4B</ref>). Private conformity in both girls (M antisocial-1 = .379, SD antisocial-1 = .629; M antisocial-8 = -.080, SD antisocial-8 = 1.269) and boys (M antisocial-1 = .249, SD prosocial-1 = 1.031; M antisocial-8 = -.049, SD antisocial-8 = .907) was higher in the antisocial-1 condition compared to the antisocial-8 condition.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conformity</head><p>Correlations between domains of the NEO-FFI personality scale and public/private conformity were assessed. Across the four task conditions, private conformity within the prosocial-1 condition was positively correlated with Agreeableness (r = .362 ** , p = .002). Conversely, public conformity within the antisocial-1 condition was negatively correlated with the Extraversion (r=-.266 * , p = .035). No other significant correlation was found between personality domains of NEO-FFI and different forms of conformity; all p-values were greater than .07 for the rest of the results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion:</head><p>This study examined the social influence of knowledge-based high and low-social status on adolescents' public and private conformity towards prosocial and antisocial decisions using an experimental paradigm. The study also investigated the role of gender and personality traits in adolescents' social conformity. The findings suggest that through all the different factors (exposure to different knowledge-based statuses, conditions, and contexts), the confederate's status could significantly affect conformity regardless of gender. Adolescents tend to conform more to highstatus peers compared to low-status ones which is compatible with the previous studies revealed that individuals find the high-status peer as a better guide and an admirable person to pursue <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Bunderson, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Deutsch &amp; Gerard, 1955;</ref><ref type="bibr">Kurschilgen et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Kumru &amp; Vesterlund, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Bekkers &amp; Wiepking, 2010)</ref>. Additionally, during adolescence, individuals strive to reform their identity, making their self-image more significant <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Felson, 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Helms et al., 2014)</ref>. At this stage, conformity to the decisions of high-status peers becomes more important as adolescents seek to create a favorable identity that mirrors those peers <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Gibbons et al., 2002)</ref>.</p><p>Alternatively, it is important to note that conformity in public and private contexts undergoes significant changes, especially through different conditions. We found that adolescents are more inclined to publicly conform to prosocial decisions than to publicly conform to antisocial ones which is consistent with previous research indicating that people tend to behave more prosocial when they know they are being observed by others <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Andreoni &amp; Petrie, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Yoeli et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Raihani &amp; Power, 2021)</ref>.</p><p>Adolescents who publicly conform to prosocial decisions serve both individual and group goals. When their public decisions are observed by others, being prosocial helps to build a positive reputation, and decisions can shape their peers' judgment of them <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Raihani &amp; Power, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Bereczkei et al., 2007)</ref>. This, in turn, might lead others to behave similarly, ultimately promoting the common good. On the other hand, when adolescents refuse to publicly conform to antisocial decisions, they demonstrate their trustworthiness and show that they are cooperative.</p><p>Not following the antisocial decision and showing neglect toward such peers and their decisions can be used as a means to punish free-rider peers <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Fehr &amp; Schurtenberger, 2018)</ref>. Moreover, this can alert others about such unacceptable behavior, which can decrease participants' payoff. Another aspect of exposure to peer's antisocial decision is that adolescents feel threatened when they see a peer making such an antisocial decision, even though it could be visible to others. This behavior could be a clear signal that the antisocial decision might be repeated in private situations, leading to real harm to the overall public good and might spread through the group <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Raihani &amp; Hart, 2010)</ref>. Therefore, despite the tendency for adolescents to not follow the antisocial decision in public, and to be deemed good or reputable, it is important to consider that individuals are also concerned about their own gain <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Semmann et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Raihani &amp; Power, 2021)</ref>. As a result, individuals may privately choose to conform to antisocial decisions to hinder the potential harm. They may do so because their decision is no longer observable, and they are not concerned about tarnishing their character <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Semmann et al., 2004)</ref>.</p><p>By examining the impact of the confederate's status and gender on different forms of conformity, the result shows that through prosocial decisions, compared to girls, boys are more likely to be influenced by peers with a high level of knowledge in both public and private contexts. This result is compatible with previous research indicating that high-status boys have a greater impact on peers' prosocial behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Choukas-Bradley et al., 2015)</ref>. The greater influence of knowledge-based high-status confederate on boys could be due to the reason that boys tend to admire the decisions of peers with high status and try to strengthen their bond with such peers <ref type="bibr">(Brechwald &amp; Prinstein, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Cialdini and Goldstein, 2004)</ref>. Therefore, by conforming to high-status peer's decision, which is the optimal strategy for the group, boys can enhance their self-esteem <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Field et al., 2023)</ref> and establish affiliation by adopting behaviors that align with the values of highstatus peers <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Field et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Gerrard et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Juvonen &amp; Ho, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Juvonen &amp; Murdock, 1995)</ref>.</p><p>Further, we found contrary to boys, girls displayed more public conformity and cooperation with low-status rather than high-status peer in prosocial decisions as they probably felt less competition <ref type="bibr">(Fiske et al., 2018)</ref>. In general, girls mostly avoid competition, especially with samegender peers, and their focus is to reduce the inequality produced by hierarchical systems based on competition <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Croson &amp; Gneezy, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Lee, 2016)</ref>, even by simply declaring it. Additionally, girls may conform publicly, but not privately to low-status peer, trying to convey a sense of friendship, although it is against their internal beliefs <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Hochschild, 1979;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Rosenberg &amp; Simmons, 1975)</ref>. This suggests that girls may have a lower desire than boys to attain high status, by conforming to such peers. High-status girls are not that much liked by other girls due to their perceived arrogance, which results in resentment towards them <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Arch, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Eder, 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Eder &amp; Nenga, 2003)</ref>. In addition, girls are shown to be very sensitive about the social context, cues, and emotions they experience, which can result in unpredictable reactions compared to boys <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Croson &amp; Gneezy, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr">Espinosa &amp; Kovárik, 2015)</ref>. Therefore, an alternative explanation for their inclination toward low-status peer in a public context could be their desire to stand against their high-status peer. The latter result may also be explained by applying the same concept in a reversed direction to adolescent boys who conform to high-status peers through prosocial decisions and wish to differentiate themselves from low-status ones and create an identity that opposes them <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Cohen &amp; Prinstein, 2006)</ref>. It is probably more important for girls to demonstrate their positive connection with low-status peers due to relationship-oriented motives instead of impressing or valuing high-status peers by conforming to them publicly through prosocial decisions. On the other hand, it is common for adolescent girls to react toward a high-status peer by engaging in relational aggression, which is mostly girls' approach to meanly manipulate the social network or status of a specific peer to induce a negative emotion. This behavior has been observed both in person <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Archer &amp; Coyne, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr">Bjorkqvist et al., 1992)</ref> and in cyberspace <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Wright, 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Concerning antisocial decisions, on the other hand, confederates with higher knowledge influenced adolescents to internalize related beliefs and encouraged them to conform to unfair donations more than low-status peers in private. This result is compatible with the previous studies that showed antisocial behavior of high-status adolescents compared to low-status ones has a greater influence on their peers in the context of aggressive and health-risk behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Cohen &amp; Prinstein, 2006 ;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Juvonen &amp; Ho, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Prinstein et al., 2011)</ref>. However, in contrast to a previous study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Cohen &amp; Prinstein (2006)</ref>, which found that adolescents conformed to antisocial decisions in both private and public settings, in our research, the impact of high-status influence was only seen in private contexts. It should be noted that in the study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Cohen &amp; Prinstein (2006)</ref>, exclusionary behavior towards peers was classified as antisocial behavior, and the public display of such behavior could be utilized to maintain the group's cohesiveness by excluding individuals perceived as dissimilar. However, in the current study, keeping money from others as a public display of antisocial behavior would go against serving the common good. Additionally, conforming to non-cooperating behavior upheld by high-status peer would not help the participants gain credit, as an antisocial decision is not widely accepted or commendable <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Meehan et al., 2022)</ref>. Therefore, even if adolescents were inclined towards making antisocial decisions in line with high-status peers, they refrained from demonstrating such behavior in public.</p><p>Based on our findings, there is a correlation between different forms of conformity with high-status peers and personality domains, regardless of gender. We observed that adolescents with higher scores in Agreeableness tend to show more conformity through prosocial decisions in private, whereas public non-conformity towards antisocial decisions is related to Extraversion. These results are consistent with the categorization introduced in the previous study <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(DeYoung et al., 2002)</ref>, where Agreeableness was identified as one of the factors that encourage conformity and aligns with the definition of being compassionate, empathic, and cooperative. On the other hand, Extraversion falls under the category that may result in non-conformity, enabling individuals to express their opinions freely.</p><p>Regarding the present project, certain limitations need to be taken into account. First, due to the online nature of the task, it was difficult to control the participants' environment while they were performing the task.</p><p>It is worthwhile to consider similar designs in laboratory and in person, as this could enhance the experience and facilitate better communication among the participants. Second, the study only compared adolescents' public and private conformity with individuals of the same gender. It would be beneficial to examine how mixed-gender peers may affect the results, as this could provide valuable insights into the dynamics of the group. Third, this study used the perceived high, and low status regarding knowledge, which can respectively, trigger feelings of competition or empathy among participants. It would be helpful to measure and control any negative or positive emotions toward the first and last-ranked person to ensure impartiality. At last, assessing participants' conformity toward other statuses may be advantageous in order to determine the degree of conformity shown by participants toward for example individuals who have a status close to them.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion:</head><p>In general, this research suggests that, in a group of adolescents, regardless of gender, individuals with high knowledge-based status can influence peers to show more conformity than low-status individuals.</p><p>However, exposure to prosocial and antisocial decisions may result in different reactions. In general, adolescents tend to display more conformity in prosocial conditions than in antisocial ones, especially when they are being observed, in order to reveal their cooperative and collectivist nature.</p><p>Moreover, public conformity towards an antisocial decision is not acceptable, but it can lead adolescents to internalize these decisions through private conditions as others' antisocial decisions could be perceived as a threat.</p><p>When considering gender differences, there was a meaningful gender difference in reacting to high-status prosocial decisions, especially in the public context, where girls were found to be less influenced by the prosocial decisions of high-status compared to low-status peers. Since in competitive settings, specific individuals may receive more attention due to their desirable features, such as knowledge, girls tend to show less conformity towards them. In contrast, it appears that boys benefit from competitive contexts that maximize their motivation to impress their highly knowledgeable peers and internalize their admired behaviors. On the other hand, high-status individuals who exhibit antisocial behavior (keeping the money instead of contributing to the public pot), were effective at motivating adolescents to make free-riding decisions, even if they were not declaring publicly regardless of gender. Our findings show that knowledgefocused contexts can result in the emergence of high-status peers who can promote antisocial or prosocial behavior, including cooperating and noncooperating decisions among their peers. As such, schools have the potential to educate or take advantage of these high-knowledge peers to encourage the consideration of public goods or discourage free-riding. blue) were consistently more likely to be ranked first and last. After eight rounds, they were presented with a final ranking based on total points, representing each player's status. Here the designated participant is indicated in red, who always ranked fourth in the final ranking (C) Schematic diagram of the modified PGG task. In this part, participants were asked to choose the amount of money they wished to donate using their tokens ranging from 0 to 50. Here the designated participant is indicated in red. Participants made their choices in two different contexts (public and private) in each round. In the first round, participants were asked to donate as much as they wished, which was kept private, and then they would choose a public declaration of donation. Next, due to the betweensubject design of conditions, participants would see a public declaration of donation made by a high or low-status confederate (in blue). In prosocial-1, the high-status confederate declared to donate 50, while in antisocial-1, he/she declared to donate zero. In prosocial-8 and antisocial-8, the low-status confederate declared to donate 50 or zero, respectively. By displaying the confederate's public declaration of donation, participants could decide how much to report as their private donation and public declaration of donation in the second round (each of the participants' choices was made after the displayed public declaration of donation of specific confederate except the first public and private choices, which were served as the baseline, and participants decided without any additional information from others).  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>through a multifaceted approach, leveraging advertisements on social media platforms (e.g., Instagram, WhatsApp, and Telegram), outreach in elementary and high schools in Tehran and Karaj, and in-person advertisements. Those who indicated interest received a detailed video outlining the experiment's nature and tasks. Out of the 463 initial volunteers, 360 took part in the experiment. However, 89 individuals were excluded for various reasons such as being unresponsive during the task and not adhering to time limits (65 participants), missing data (eight participants), providing incorrect answers to attention check questions (12 participants), or expressing reservations about playing against computers instead of real opponents (four participants; see the manipulation of status section). Ultimately, data from 271 adolescents comprising 132 boys, and 139 girls, within the age range of 13 to 20 years (M = 17.000, SD = 1.495) were analyzed. Irrespective of their performance in the PGG task, all participants received $5 discount coupons as compensation. Both participants and their parents provided SOCIAL STATUS AND CONFORMITY IN ADOLESCENCE informed consent electronically.
