<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Sustainable lifestyle changes are an important demand-side solution to reduce CO2 emissions.</p><p>While sustainable lifestyles are increasingly included in integrated assessment models, modellers have so far not managed to realistically model what drives changes in lifestyles.</p><p>Important questions about the feasibility and likelihood of lifestyle change, and how lifestyle changes can be accelerated or promoted thus go unanswered. Environmental psychology is a discipline dedicated to understanding environmental behaviour, and its theories and findings could therefore be instrumental to informing the modelling of lifestyle change in integrated assessment models. Yet, we identify two barriers currently hinder the systematic integration of this knowledge into integrated assessment modelling. The first barrier is plurality: there are many theories and findings that are potentially relevant to modelling lifestyle change, but guidance is lacking on which to apply when. The second barrier is ambiguity: many theories in psychology are not precise enough to unambiguously translate them into a mathematical model. To overcome the barrier of plurality, we introduce the Motivation, Agency, and Past behaviour (MAP) framework, which summarises and integrates the insights of 8 prominent behavioural theories used in environmental psychology and that can be used to determine which theories and determinants are most relevant for specific modelling applications. To overcome the barrier of ambiguity, we identify three areas where the precision of theorizing in environmental psychology can be improved, namely definitions and consistent use of constructs, the specification of relationships between constructs, and describing the strength and boundary conditions of these relationships. We urge for closer collaborations between modellers and environmental psychologists to successfully model the drivers and impacts of sustainable lifestyle change.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Representing the drivers of lifestyle change in Integrated Assessment Models using theories from environmental psychology: introducing the Motivation, Agency, and Past Behaviour (MAP) framework Climate change poses a severe and global threat to people and nature <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(IPCC, 2023)</ref>.</p><p>While the consequences of climate change are already unfolding, the worst impacts can still be avoided if climate change is limited to 1.5 or 2 degrees <ref type="bibr">(IPCC, 2018</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(IPCC, , 2023))</ref>. Integrated assessment models (IAMs) play a critical role in outlining the pathways that could be taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and reach climate targets (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">IPCC, 2023)</ref>. While these models feature highly sophisticated representations of earth systems and economic and societal developments, the dynamics of human behaviour are not systematically represented <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Beckage et al., 2021</ref>). Yet, changes in behaviour towards more sustainable lifestyles are critical elements in the response to climate change (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Grubler et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">van Vuuren et al., 2018)</ref>. Accurately representing such lifestyles changes in IAMs is thus essential to ensure their policy relevance to reach realistic and effective scenarios for combating climate change.</p><p>The field of environmental psychology has studied the drivers of pro-environmental behaviour for over 40 years (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Cone &amp; Hayes, 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Stokols, 1978)</ref>, and therefore represents a rich resource to inform the modelling of sustainable lifestyle changes. Yet, this literature has so far not been systematically applied in integrated assessment modelling. The aim of this paper is therefore to showcase what the environmental psychology literature can contribute to the climate modelling community, and to examine how its uptake in IAMs can be accelerated. We start by reviewing the current state of the art regarding the representation of human behaviour in IAMs. We then identify two barriers to effectively using the environmental psychology literature (and social science literature more generally) to model drivers of lifestyle changes. The first barrier is plurality: there are many potentially relevant theories and findings, making it difficult to decide what to include in IAMs. The second barrier is ambiguity: many theories are not precise enough to unambiguously translate them into a mathematical model. We then introduce solutions to overcome these barriers for the environmental psychology literature, specifically. To overcome the barrier of plurality, we introduce the MAP-framework (Motivation, Agency, Past Behaviour): a meta-theoretical framework that summarises and integrates the key insights from 8 important theories in environmental psychology, and which can be used to determine which theories and determinants are most relevant for specific modelling applications. We illustrate the usage of the MAP-framework with a case study that focuses on electric vehicle adoption. To overcome the barrier of ambiguity, we introduce a comprehensive research agenda that identifies key areas in which the precision of theories in environmental psychology can be improved.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Representing lifestyle change in IAMs</head><p>IAMs play a key role in climate science, discourse, and policy. Featuring sophisticated simulations of natural processes and economic and societal developments, they can be used to explore how different policies affect global CO2 emissions, temperature levels, and economic outcomes (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Riahi et al., 2017)</ref>. So far, IAMs have mainly focused on so-called supply-side solutions: solutions that aim to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by either making the supply of energy more sustainable and more efficient, mostly via technological advances such as renewable and nuclear energy, or by removing emitted carbon from the atmosphere through carbon capture and storage <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Creutzig et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Mundaca et al., 2018)</ref>. Supply-side solutions alone will however likely not be sufficient to reach the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Cap et al., 2024)</ref>, while the feasibility of scaling up carbon capture and storage is also debated <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Dziejarski et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Kriegler et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>In addition to supply-side solutions, more and more attention is therefore now being paid to the potential of demand-side solutions, which aim to reduce GHG emissions by lowering the demand for energy, goods and services by households, institutions, and businesses <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Creutzig et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Creutzig et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Grubler et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b108">van Vuuren et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Demand-side solutions can, if supplemented with infrastructural and technological changes, substantially reduce GHG emissions in different end-use sectors, from 40% in the food domain, to 73% in the electricity domain <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(IPCC, 2023)</ref>. Interestingly, demand-side solutions can in many cases also contribute to increasing well-being, for example by reducing pollution and increasing health <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Creutzig et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Mundaca et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Many demand-side solutions require changes in people's lifestyles, including the way in which people travel, eat, use energy, and buy, use, and dispose of products (van den <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">Berg et al., 2019)</ref>. Sustainable lifestyle changes are, in the context of integrated assessment modelling, defined as changes in people's behaviour that lower the demand for energy in the broad sense of the word, and thus have a positive impact on the environment (van den <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">Berg et al., 2019)</ref>. While lifestyle changes are increasingly included in IAMs, they are currently often modelled exogenously as fixed assumptions, meaning they are assumed to be adopted by people universally, and without considering their feasibility and likelihood, nor how they could be affected by other developments that form part of the model, such as changes in the climate, implemented policies, or technology changes (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Napp et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Pettifor et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Samadi et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Saujot et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Trutnevyte et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">van den Berg et al., 2019)</ref>.</p><p>While exogenously modelling lifestyle change provides important insights into the potential of lifestyle change as a strategy to reduce GHG emissions, such models rely on the assumption that lifestyle changes will occur spontaneously <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Saujot et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Trutnevyte et al., 2019)</ref>. Yet, decades of social science research demonstrate that behaviour change can be difficult to realise (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Duckworth &amp; Gross, 2020)</ref>. Key questions regarding the feasibility and likelihood of lifestyle change as a demand-side solution thus currently go unanswered <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Otto et al., 2020)</ref>  in IAMs.</p><p>To explore these questions and increase the behavioural realism of lifestyle change, IAMs will need to endogenously model lifestyle changes, meaning they explicitly consider the factors that affect the likelihood of lifestyle changes, or changes in people's environmental behaviours, and link them to other elements represented in IAMs (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Samadi et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">van den Berg et al., 2019)</ref>. Here, environmental psychology comes in as a relevant body of knowledge. Since at least the 1970s, environmental psychologists have studied environmental behaviour (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Cone &amp; Hayes, 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Stokols, 1978)</ref>, which is defined as 'behaviour that change the availability of materials or energy from the environment or alter the structure and dynamics of ecosystems or the biosphere' <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">(Steg &amp; Vlek, 2009)</ref>. More specifically, environmental psychologists are interested in what motivates people to engage in pro-environmental behaviour, or 'behaviour that harms the environment as little as possible, or even benefits the environment' <ref type="bibr">(Steg &amp; Vlek, 2009, p. 309)</ref>, which conceptually aligns with sustainable lifestyle change. Indeed, virtually all behaviours that are considered relevant as part of a sustainable lifestyle, such as lowering the thermostat, traveling more sustainably, and eating a sustainable diet (e.g., see <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Eker et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Grubler et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">McCollum et al., 2017)</ref> are (and have been) studied in the domain of environmental psychology <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Hampton &amp; Whitmarsh, 2023)</ref>. Indeed, as we will show below, decades of work in this field have led to comprehensive insights into the factors that are relevant to understanding pro-environmental behaviour in general (see for example <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bamberg &amp; Möser, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Klöckner, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Steg et al., 2014)</ref>, as well as specific types of pro-environmental behaviour (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Gardner &amp; Abraham, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Geiger et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Graves &amp; Roelich, 2021)</ref>. Some initial studies already show that explicitly modelling the drivers of environmental behaviour using insights from environmental psychology can yield insights into if and under which conditions lifestyle changes can be achieved (see for example <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Beckage et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Eker et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">McCollum et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Moore et al., 2022)</ref>. For example, a study that modelled the drivers of sustainable food consumption found that a significant global shift towards more sustainable consumption patterns was unlikely to occur without policy interventions <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Eker et al., 2019)</ref>. Moreover, particularly people's perceived self-efficacy (i.e., perceptions of being able to engage in the behaviour) and social norms (i.e., perceptions which behaviour is commonly done and approved of by others), rather than concerns about health or perceived risks of climate change, were key in realizing the societal shift to a more sustainable diet <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Eker et al., 2019)</ref>. Such insights are critical to developing effective interventions that target the relevant determinants of behaviour (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">van Valkengoed et al., 2022)</ref>, demonstrating why modelling specifically the drivers of environmental behaviour is so important.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Barriers to modelling sustainable lifestyle changes</head><p>At first glance, the environmental psychology literature thus seems perfectly suited to help modellers overcome the challenge of endogenously modelling of sustainable lifestyle changes in IAMs. Yet, despite a rich body of literature to build on and promising initial efforts, works that endogenously model sustainable lifestyle changes have been rare, and environmental psychology literature and findings have so far been represented in models to only a limited extent. While we currently have a handful of proof-of-concept studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Beckage et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Bury et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Eker et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">McCollum et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Moore et al., 2022)</ref>, there is no consistent or dedicated stream of literature that considers how the modelling of lifestyle changes can be further refined, that challenges or expands upon previous models, that considers which methods are most appropriate to capture behavioural dynamics, that synthesizes the best practices and challenges in the literature, or that discusses how the different theories and vast body of empirical findings in environmental psychology can be best applied.</p><p>The mere availability of a large literature on the drivers and barriers of proenvironmental behaviour therefore does not suffice to address the challenge of more systematically considering lifestyle changes in IAMs. We identify two barriers that currently hinder systematically applying insights from environmental psychology (but which broadly also apply to other bodies of social science literature that study environmental behaviour).</p><p>The first barrier is that there is a large number of theories and findings that could be potentially relevant to modelling the drivers of environmental behaviour, and it is therefore difficult to determine which factors and theories to focus on (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Elsawah et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Müller-Hansen et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Schlüter et al., 2017)</ref>. We call this the barrier of plurality. Imagine you want to model factors influencing the adoption of a sustainable diet (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Eker et al., 2019)</ref>, for practical application). Various theories employed in environmental psychology could explain dietary choices, such as Protection Motivation Theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Rogers, 1983)</ref>, which proposes that behaviour depends on perception of risk sand perceived efficacy and costs of behaviours, Value-Belief-Norm Theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">(Stern, 2000)</ref>, which focuses on people's moral motivations to engage in behaviour, or the social identity approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Abrams &amp; Hogg, 1990)</ref> which particularly considers social reasons why people may or may not follow a vegetarian or vegan diet. The difference between theories, their explanatory scope, and the conditions under which particular theories perform better or worse in explaining particular behaviours, are often not clearly outlined in the descriptions of the theories, which can make it difficult to make an informed choice.</p><p>The second barrier is that many theories in environmental psychology <ref type="bibr">(and beyond)</ref> are not yet precise enough to unambiguously translate them into mathematical expressions, which is needed to be able to integrate psychological theories into a model <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(De Cian et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Poile &amp; Safayeni, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Schlüter et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Schwarz et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b105">van Sluisveld et al., 2020)</ref>. For example, theories often do not specify the strength or shape <ref type="bibr">(e.g., linear, parabolic, sigmoidal)</ref> of relationships between predictors of behaviour, or how these relationships develop over time <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Elsawah et al., 2020)</ref>. As a result, researchers need to decide how they will translate the verbal description of a theory into mathematical equations, but such assumptions are currently difficult to determine and justify. Different modelling teams may thus interpret and implement the same theories in different ways, making it difficult to compare different modelling implementations to each other, and to determine which implementations are either more or less accurate, which hinders the cumulative improvement of modelling the drivers of environmental behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Muelder &amp; Filatova, 2018)</ref>. We call this the barrier of ambiguity.</p><p>We propose two solutions to these barriers that will help make better use of the environmental psychology literature to represent the drivers of environmental behaviour in IAMs. First, to overcome the barrier of plurality, we introduce the Motivation, Agency, Past behaviour (MAP) framework, a meta-theoretical framework that summarizes and synthesizes insights from eight main behavioural theories in environmental psychology. This framework summarizes the key theorizing in environmental psychology, and enables researchers to identify and select relevant theories or determinants of environmental behaviour and lifestyles. Second, to overcome the barrier of ambiguity, we identify in what areas theorizing in environmental psychology lacks specificity, and suggest guidelines on how theorizing can be made more precise such that theories can be formalized (or rendered mathematically) within models with less ambiguity and uncertainty. A visual overview of the barriers and solutions is presented in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Overcoming the barrier of plurality: the MAP-framework</head><p>Within environmental psychology, there is a large body of theoretical and empirical literature on the determinants of environmental behaviour (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bamberg &amp; Möser, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr">IPCC, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Klöckner, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Steg, 2023)</ref>. One way to cope with the plurality of theories is to develop a meta-theory: higher-order theorizing that analyses, structures, and compares different theories <ref type="bibr">(APA, 2018a)</ref>. Such meta-theory can be used to make an informed decision on which theory or which constructs to model, when, and why, thus helping the development of focused and concise models.</p><p>We introduce here a new meta-theoretical framework based on the most relevant theories in environmental psychology used to explain environmental behaviour, which outlines differences and overlaps between theories (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>). We call this meta-theory the MAP-framework (Motivations, Agency, Past behaviour). To develop the MAPframework, we first determined, on the basis of literature reviews on pro-environmental behaviour and text books on environmental psychology <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bamberg &amp; Möser, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Dietz, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Gifford &amp; Nilsson, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Gifford et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Klöckner, 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Klöckner, , 2015;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Koger &amp; Du Nann Winter, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Scott et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Steg &amp; Nordlund, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Steg &amp; Vlek, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Turuga et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b106">van Valkengoed et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b112">White et al., 2019)</ref>, the most important theories used to explain environmental behaviour in the field, which are:</p><p>1.</p><p>Theory of Planned Behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Ajzen, 1991)</ref> 2.</p><p>Protection Motivation Theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Rogers, 1983)</ref> 3.</p><p>Norm Activation Model <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(Schwartz, 1977)</ref> 4.</p><p>Value-Belief-Norm Theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">(Stern, 2000)</ref> 5.</p><p>Environmental Self-Identity Theory (Van der <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">Werff et al., 2013)</ref> 6.</p><p>Focus Theory of Normative Conduct <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Cialdini et al., 1990)</ref> 7.</p><p>The Social Identity Approach<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">foot_0</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Abrams &amp; Hogg, 1990)</ref> 8.</p><p>Habit Theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Orbell &amp; Verplanken, 2020)</ref> A visual summary of each theory is presented in the Supplemental Material. We organise the insights and propositions of these theories along three main pillars (following <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Triandis, 1977)</ref>. First, what motivations do people have to (not) engage in pro-environmental behaviour? Second, to what extent do people feel agency to engage in pro-environmental behaviour and reduce their environmental impact? Third, how does past environmental behaviour influence future pro-environmental behaviour? Importantly, we point out that the same or similar constructs appear in different theories under different names. To avoid confusion, we refer here to the same constructs across different theories using one single label following the overview of relevant constructs used to explain environmental behaviour provided in <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">(van Valkengoed et al., 2022)</ref>, while providing the label originally used in the theory between brackets and in cursive. We discuss this problem of inconsistent labelling of constructs in more detail later. The following section introduces the main ideas of these 8 theories, and presents a comprehensive overview of key theorizing within environmental psychology. theories used to explain environmental behaviour in environmental psychology fit into this framework, and how these theories overlap and differ from each other. NAM = Norm Activation Model. VBN = Value-Belief-Norm Theory.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>What motivations do people have to (not) engage in pro-environmental behaviour?</head><p>Motivation can be defined as 'the impetus that gives purpose or direction to behaviour' (APA, 2018b), or more simply, the reasons people have for (not) engaging in behaviour.</p><p>Across the theories, different motivational factors are identified, which can be summarized into three overarching types of motivation to engage in environmental behaviour: perceived personal costs and benefits, moral motivations, and social motivations (IPCC, 2022). Notably, the theories we included focus mostly on cognitions, or the contents of people's thoughts, to represent people's motivations. However, recent developments in the field demonstrate that many of these motivations are not just cognitive, but are also accompanied by emotions, which can steer people to (not) act pro-environmentally <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Brosch, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Brosch &amp; Steg, 2021)</ref>.</p><p>Below, we therefore highlight both cognitions as well as relevant emotions that can be associated with each of the motivations.</p><p>First, perceived personal costs and benefits refer to people's evaluations of what they can personally gain from acting pro-environmentally, which are offset against potential personal losses or discomforts <ref type="bibr">(IPCC, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Steg &amp; Vlek, 2009)</ref>. For example, turning down the heater may save people money (benefit) but may make people feel cold (costs). Costs and benefits can be cognitive evaluations of resources (e.g., time, money), but also affective (feeling good or comfortable, enjoying a behaviour). People's evaluations of the sum of costs and benefits reflect their attitude towards a particular behaviour, which is a key construct in the Theory of Planned Behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Ajzen, 1991)</ref>. Similarly, Protection Motivation Theory considers trade-offs between costs and benefits as part of the threat appraisal <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Rogers, 1983)</ref>,</p><p>where costs are conceptualized as perceived risks, which is based on the perceived likelihood and severity of experiencing a hazard. Perception of a risk can be accompanied by emotions such as worry, concern, or fear (van der <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Linden, 2017)</ref>. Protection Motivation Theory also proposes that people's motivation to act depends on the perceived rewards associated with not acting pro-environmentally (e.g., being more comfortable), which are referred to as maladaptive response rewards, and the perceived response costs associated with acting proenvironmentally (e.g., the amount of effort required): people are more likely to act proenvironmentally if response costs and maladaptive response rewards are perceived as low <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Kothe et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Rogers, 1983)</ref>.</p><p>Second, people can be driven to act pro-environmentally because of moral motivations, or in other words, because they believe it is the right thing to do. Both the Norm Activation Model <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(Schwartz, 1977)</ref> and Value-Belief-Norm Theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">(Stern, 2000)</ref> focus on moral motivations to explain pro-environmental behaviour. The Norm Activation Model proposes that people are more likely to act pro-environmentally when they feel a personal norm to act pro-environmentally, meaning they feel responsible and morally obliged to act in an environmentally friendly way (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Schwartz, 1977)</ref>. Personal norms are stronger when people are more aware that their own behaviour is causing environmental problems (i.e., problem awareness, also referred to as awareness of consequences), and when they more strongly believe their personal actions will help in resolving the problem (i.e., outcome efficacy, also referred to, perhaps confusingly, as ascription of responsibility within NAM and VBN; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Steg &amp; de Groot, 2010)</ref>. Outcome efficacy falls under the second pillar of the MAP-framework: Agency, explained below.</p><p>The Value-Belief-Norm Theory adds to this reasoning that this process of problem awareness, outcome efficacy, and personal norms depends on the extent to which people endorse different values. Specifically, the more people value nature and the environment (i.e., biospheric values), and find protecting and taking care of other people important (i.e., altruistic values), the more likely they will have a higher problem awareness, leading to stronger perceptions of outcome efficacy and a stronger personal norm to act environmentally-friendly. Conversely if people have strong egoistic and hedonic values, meaning they strongly value personal resources (e.g., money, status) and enjoyment and pleasure, respectively, people will likely have lower problem awareness, and thus lower perceived outcome efficacy and weaker personal norms to act pro-environmentally.</p><p>Emotions play an important role in explaining why personal norms can influence our behaviour. Specifically, acting in line with personal norms may elicit positive emotions such as pride, while failing to act according to personal norms can lead to negative emotions such as guilt and regret <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Onwezen et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Shipley &amp; van Riper, 2022)</ref>. The anticipation of feeling these positive or negative emotions plays an important role in whether people decide to act in line with their personal norms, and thus act pro-environmentally or not <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Brosch &amp; Steg, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Schneider et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Environmental Self-identity Theory (Van der <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">Werff et al., 2013)</ref> proposes that another motivation to act pro-environmentally is people's perception of the extent to which they are an environmentally-friendly person (i.e., environmental self-identity). Environmental selfidentity can play an important role in determining environmental behaviour, as people are motivated to act in line with how they see themselves <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Festinger, 1957)</ref>. We consider environmental self-identity as a form of moral motivation, as Environmental Self-Identity</p><p>Theory proposes that environmental self-identity is rooted in and inferred from people's biospheric values: the more people endorse biospheric values, the stronger their environmental self-identity (Van der <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">Werff et al., 2013)</ref>.</p><p>Third, social motivations can play an important role in motivating pro-environmental behaviour. In general, people are motivated to be liked and accepted by others and to fit in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Cialdini et al., 1990)</ref>. The Focus Theory of Normative Conduct proposes that people tend to conform to how they see other people act (the extent to which they think a behaviour is common, also known as the perceived descriptive norm), and to how they think others expect them to act (the extent to which a behaviour is (dis)approved of by others, or the perceived injunctive norm; <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Cialdini et al., 1990)</ref>. Perceived injunctive norms are also included in the Theory of Planned Behaviour as a determinant of behaviour (referred to as perceived subjective norm). Adhering to or violating descriptive and injunctive social norms can be associated with positive emotions (feeling content, belonging) and negative emotions (shame), respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Packard &amp; Schultz, 2023)</ref>.</p><p>In addition, a part of people's identity is formed by the social groups they identify with, such as nationality, sports groups, a community, or their political affiliation, which is referred to as people's social identity <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">(Tajfel &amp; Turner, 1986)</ref>. The Social Identity Approach proposes that if people strongly identify with a particular group, they will be motivated to act in line with and internalise the values and goals of these groups and their members, which affects the likelihood that people act pro-environmentally <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Fritsche et al., 2017)</ref>. Specifically, if acting pro-environmentally is an important value or goal for a specific group, people who are associated and/or identify with this group will act more pro-environmentally themselves <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Fielding &amp; Hornsey, 2016)</ref>.</p><p>To what extent do people feel agency to engage in pro-environmental behaviour and to reduce their environmental impact?</p><p>People's behaviour is not only determined by their motivations. People also need to feel they are be able to act upon their motivations and to reach their goals, which is defined as a sense of agency <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Schlosser, 2015)</ref>. Across the eight behavioural theories, three main factors reflecting this sense of agency are identified: self-efficacy, outcome efficacy, and collective efficacy.</p><p>First, self-efficacy (referred to as perceived behavioural control in the Theory of Planned Behaviour) refers to the extent to which people perceive themselves as capable of engaging in a specific behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Ajzen, 1991)</ref>. Self-efficacy depends on contextual factors that make it easier or harder (or even impossible) to perform the behaviour, such as available infrastructure, income, but also policy measures, such as laws or financial policies that hinder or promote particular behaviours <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">(Steg &amp; Vlek, 2009)</ref>. Self-efficacy also depends on psychological factors, such as knowledge about how to perform the behaviour, or confidence in one's own abilities. Both the Theory of Planned Behaviour and Protection Motivation</p><p>Theory propose that self-efficacy is a key determinant of environmental behaviour: the more people perceive themselves as capable of acting, the more likely they are to do so <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Ajzen, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Rogers, 1983)</ref>.</p><p>Second, agency is determined by the perceived effectiveness or impact of one's behaviour in reducing environmental problems, which is referred to as perceived outcome efficacy (referred to as ascription of responsibility in VBN and NAM, response efficacy in PMT, sometimes referred to as outcome expectancy in other literature). Protection Motivation Theory, the Norm Activation Model, and Value-Belief-Norm Theory identify outcome efficacy as an important determinant of pro-environmental behaviour: the more people perceive pro-environmental behaviour as effective in reducing environmental problems, the more likely they are to engage in it <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Rogers, 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Schwartz, 1977;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Stern, 2000)</ref>. Even if people perceive they can engage in a pro-environmental behaviour (i.e., high self-efficacy), they may still not engage in it if they perceive these actions as ineffective or contributing little to protecting the environment. Similar to self-efficacy, perceived outcome efficacy can depend on contextual factors (e.g., some behaviours objectively reduce more CO2 emissions than others), but also on people's subjective evaluations (e.g., personal pro-environmental behaviour may feel futile in the face of pollution by large companies) <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Gregersen et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>Third, the Social Identity Approach identifies perceived collective efficacy as an important factor that can determine people's sense of agency <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Mummendey et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b109">van Zomeren et al., 2008)</ref>. Collective efficacy is defined as people's perceptions of whether the group they belong to is capable of reaching their goals through collective effort (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Mummendey et al., 1999)</ref>. In the context of environmental behaviour, it has been found that individuals are more strongly motivated to act pro-environmentally if they perceive higher collective efficacy (i.e., they perceive they can, as a group, have an impact and can meaningfully contribute to reducing environmental problems; <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Fritsche et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p>To what extent does past environmental behaviour influence future pro-environmental behaviour?</p><p>Next, people's pro-environmental behaviour is affected by their past behaviour.</p><p>Specifically, people are more likely to act pro-environmentally if they did so in the past as well. Theories have proposed different pathways through which past pro-environmental behaviour can motivate future pro-environmental behaviour: First, Environmental Selfidentity Theory (Van der <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">Werff et al., 2013)</ref> proposes that past behaviour can influence proenvironmental behaviour via environmental self-identity: if people reflect on the extent to which they have engaged in pro-environmental in the past, they may realise they are a more (or less) of a pro-environmental person than they previously thought. In other words, people can partly infer their environmental self-identity through their past actions, which then affects the motivation to engage in subsequent pro-environmental behaviour (Van der Werff et al.,</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2013).</head><p>Second, Habit Theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Orbell &amp; Verplanken, 2020)</ref> proposes that past behaviour can play an important role in determining environmental behaviour when people have formed habits. Habits are tendencies people develop to automatically and without thinking engage in a particular behaviour when they find themselves in a certain context or situation (also referred to as the contextual cue, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Klöckner &amp; Verplanken, 2019)</ref>. Habits are built up when a particular behaviour is effective at reaching a particular goal, and people therefore engage in the same behaviour in the same or similar setting many times (e.g., turning the lights off when leaving the room) <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Linder et al., 2022)</ref>. People typically do not think or plan to engage in habits, because the action becomes associated or linked to specific cues in the environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Klöckner &amp; Verplanken, 2019)</ref>. Unsustainable habits can form a barrier to switching towards more pro-environmental behaviour, because they influence behaviour without conscious decision making <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Linder et al., 2022)</ref>. At the same time, if people engage in a new proenvironmental behaviour often enough and with satisfying outcomes, new habits can form, which ensure that the behaviour will be maintained over time without the need for conscious effort <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Lally et al., 2009)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>How to use the MAP-framework to identify relevant drivers of environmental behaviour for inclusion in models</head><p>The MAP-framework integrates current theorizing in environmental psychology on the drivers of environmental behaviour, and structures this theorizing by identifying overarching categories of determinants across theories. The MAP-framework can thus help in overcoming barrier of plurality by guiding researchers towards a specific theory or set of determinants that are most relevant to the specific behaviour or lifestyle to be modelled. To this end, the MAP-framework can be used in one of two ways.</p><p>First, working with one specific theory can guide the development of a concise model as each theory consists of a limited set of constructs. The MAP-framework can be used to differentiate between and select one of the eight underlying behavioural theories we have discussed. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref> illustrates how each theory is situated within the MAP-framework (a more detailed overview that also outlines the individual determinants within each theory is presented in the Supplemental Material). Each theory has a particular focus that may be more or less relevant to modelling a given behaviours. For example, theories focussing on social motivations (Focus Theory of Normative Conduct, Social Identity Approach) may be particularly relevant to explaining behaviours that occur in social setting, such as eating behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Higgs &amp; Thomas, 2016)</ref>. Theories that focus on moral motivations (e.g., Value-Belief-Norm Theory, Norm Activation Model) may be more relevant to explaining behaviour that requires forgoing personal gains for collective goals, that occurs in private or for which strong social norms do not (yet) exist. To further facilitate selecting a relevant theory for specific modelling goals, we present an overview of the main aims of each theory and suggestions for modelling applications in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>. An overview of all the constructs within each theory, and how these are positioned within the MAP-framework, is provided in Supplementary Table <ref type="table">1</ref>. A case study that demonstrates how the MAP-framework can be used in practice to select a relevant theory is presented in Box 1.</p><p>Second, instead of focussing on a single theory, researchers can choose to focus on modelling one of the overarching meta-theoretical pillars, that is, motivations, agency, or past behaviour. This approach may be particularly suited if there is evidence that one of these pillars is particularly important for the behaviour in question, or to explore research questions on how different determinants may interact. For example, modelling motivations can offer insight into which type of motivations (i.e., perceived costs and benefits, moral motivations, social motivations) are more or less important for different pro-environmental behaviours, how different motivations may conflict or interact in determining people's pro-environmental behaviour, and whether policies that target specific motivations can be effective in promoting behaviour. A focus on agency can be useful to explore under which conditions people feel empowered to act, and how different policies can influence this sense of agency. Focusing on past behaviour can help to gain insight into the potential speed and difficulty with which behavioural changes can be realised, as strong environmentally unfriendly habits can form a key barrier to behaviour change that need to be weakened before new behaviours can take hold <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Linder et al., 2022)</ref>. Working within each of these pillars further offers the opportunity to explore how constructs from different theories are related to each other. Specifically, because empirical studies within environmental psychology mostly focus on the relationships between variables within the same theory, exploring how constructs from different theories are related represents an opportunity to advance current theorizing and explore possible synergies and integration between theories.</p><p>Box 1: Selecting relevant theory to model drivers of lifestyle change using the MAPframework: The case of electric vehicle adoption</p><p>In this case study, we will demonstrate the practical application of the MAP-framework to determine which theoretical framework is most appropriate to model a particular behaviour.</p><p>We break down this process into 4 steps.</p><p>Step 1: Determine target behaviour</p><p>Modelling the drivers of lifestyle change starts with determining which behaviour(s) should be represented in the model. A relevant starting point can be to select behaviour(s) with a large potential for emission reductions <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">(Steg &amp; Vlek, 2009)</ref>. Studies demonstrate that switching from petrol to electric vehicles can reduce per capita carbon emissions by 500 -2000 kg per year <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Ivanova et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Koide et al., 2021)</ref>, making it one of the most promising areas where reductions in carbon emissions can be realized.</p><p>Step 2: Determine the drivers and barriers of the target behaviour</p><p>We can determine the drivers and barriers of the adoption of electric vehicles by examining literature reviews and meta-analyses. Here, we focus on two literature reviews <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Gerber Machado et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Pamidimukkala et al., 2024)</ref>, that respectively review the results of 124 and 537 articles. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">2</ref> provides an overview of the determinants that are related to the adoption of electric vehicles as listed in these review articles. Both reviews list a wide array of relevant determinants, demonstrating the plurality of relevant research findings researchers may encounter when reading overviews of the literature. Organize existing literature by sorting it into relevant MAP domains</p><p>To simplify and restructure the large number of determinants obtained from the literature reviews, we can sort them into their respective MAP domains (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref>). Note that this overview combines some of the overlapping or similar determinants mentioned in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">2</ref>, and discards some determinants that are indirect predictors of behaviour (e.g., personality traits, socio-demographic characteristics). MAP-framework.</p><p>Based on this overview, we can now see that most of the determinants of the adoption of electric vehicles are related to perceptions of the costs and benefits of electric vehicles.</p><p>Examples of perceived costs include buying and operating the vehicle, perceived unreliability, and lower safety levels. Examples of benefits include less noise while driving, comfort, and governmental incentives such as subsidies or priority parking. Perceived agency seems also an important determinant, with especially the perceptions of the available infrastructure to operate the electric vehicle (e.g., a sufficient number of charging stations) being listed as a critical factor determining the adoption of the electric vehicle.</p><p>While moral and social motivations are also mentioned in both reviews, these factors are discussed in less detail and seem to play a less prominent role<ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">foot_1</ref> .</p><p>Step 4: Select theory that covers the identified relevant MAP domains</p><p>The analysis in step 3 suggests that the drivers of electric vehicle adoption are primarily cost and benefit motivations and perceived agency. Examining the MAP-framework presented in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>, we can determine that an appropriate theoretical framework to represent the adoption of electric vehicles would therefore be Protection Motivation Theory, because its constructs cover both the trade-off between costs and benefits of driving an electric vehicle, as well as perceptions of agency by considering self-and outcome efficacy. Indeed, the Protection Motivation Theory appeared to be successful in explaining the adoption of electric vehicles <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bockarjova &amp; Steg, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Langbroek et al., 2017</ref>). An alternative option could be the Theory of Planned Behaviour, which covers both perceived costs and benefits and perceived agency (albeit in less detail than Protection Motivation Theory), but which also includes social motivations as a possible additional factor. Importantly, we recommend researchers do not attempt to include each individual variable mentioned in the literature in their model, but rather rely on more overarching theoretical constructs to reflect these considerations. For example, the higher purchasing costs, smaller driving range, longer charging time, and lower reliability can all be subsumed under 'perceived costs' of switching to an electric vehicle.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Overcoming the barrier of ambiguity</head><p>The MAP-framework addresses the problem of navigating the extensive environmental psychology literature when modelling the drivers of sustainable lifestyle change. However, this addresses only part of the challenge of modelling lifestyle change.</p><p>Indeed, the second barrier that hinders the modelling of the drivers of environmental behaviour, ambiguity, remains: many theories in environmental psychology are yet not precise enough to unambiguously translate them into a mathematical model (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Schlüter et al., 2017)</ref>. When a model is developed based on a specific theory, there are typically many elements that need to be specified which are however often not considered in the original formulation of the theory, nor explored in the literature more broadly. As a result, researchers need to make many assumptions when they want to render psychological theories in a model (see for example <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Beckage et al., 2018)</ref>. Indeed, modelling teams working with the same theory have come up with greatly varying models <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Muelder &amp; Filatova, 2018)</ref>. This can be problematic, as different implementations of the same theory can yield different modelling results and conclusions, while it is often not clear which modelling approach should be considered best or most accurate <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Muelder &amp; Filatova, 2018)</ref>. Reducing ambiguity by making theories more precise is therefore an important goal in order to improve and systematize the uptake of behavioural theories in modelling environmental behaviour. Below, we first identify three areas relating to the formulation and application of behavioural theories in environmental psychology that can contribute to ambiguity. We then offer a set of recommendations on how theorizing and the use of behavioural theories in environmental psychology can become more precise and standardized in order to reduce ambiguity and promote their systematic uptake in modelling the drivers of environmental behaviour.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">The definition and use of constructs</head><p>The first area where ambiguity of theories can arise is the definition and application of key constructs within theories. Constructs (also referred to as concepts, determinants, or variables) refer to the individual components of a theory that jointly explain the dependent variable, in this case environmental behaviour (see also Table <ref type="table">1</ref> and Supplemental Material, listing the key constructs included in the theories that form the MAP-framework). Currently, ambiguity can arise because there are inconsistencies in how constructs are called, defined and measured in the environmental psychology literature, and it is not always clear which exact set of constructs are associated with a particular theory.</p><p>First, there can be inconsistencies in how the constructs that make up a theory are defined and measured. For example, there is much discussion about how the concept of self-efficacy (or perceived behavioural control) in the Theory of Planned Behaviour should be understood, stemming partly from an unclear conceptualization within the original theory (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Ajzen, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Kraft et al., 2005)</ref>. Similarly, the construct of risk perception within Protection Motivation Theory is assessed in many different ways across studies: some researchers focus on measuring its sub-components of perceived vulnerability and severity, while others assess risk perception as a more overarching construct, often collapsing these two dimensions <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Kothe et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b107">van Valkengoed &amp; Steg, 2019)</ref>. Researchers also often do not explicitly provide clear definitions of the constructs that they are studying <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bringmann et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Flake &amp; Fried, 2020)</ref>. This can inadvertently obscure differences between studies, as readers may (incorrectly) assume that studies that mention the same constructs are also understanding and measuring these constructs in the same way (also known as the "jingle" fallacy, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Flake &amp; Fried, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Lilienfeld &amp; Strother, 2020)</ref>. Similarly, we have already shown in this article that the same (or very similar) constructs may appear under different labels in different theories (also known as the "jangle" fallacy, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Flake &amp; Fried, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Lilienfeld &amp; Strother, 2020)</ref>.</p><p>For example, the construct of outcome efficacy is also referred to as outcome expectancy, response efficacy, and ascription of responsibility across the literature. The use of different labels for the same constructs makes it more difficult to find relevant articles and to accurately synthesize the literature. Second, it is not always clear which set of constructs make up a theory. Many theories represented in the MAP-framework have been proposed 20, 30, or even 40 years ago, and are also used in different fields of application (e.g., understanding health behaviour, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Ogden, 2019)</ref>. These theories have been tested frequently and by different researchers, over time yielding insights on which parts of the theory are supported and where the theory can be improved. Suggestions to remove or add constructs have been proposed, either by the original authors of the theory, or by other researchers. For example, the first iteration of Protection Motivation Theory did not include self-efficacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Rogers, 1975)</ref> which was only added during a later revision of the model <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Rogers, 1983)</ref>. Over time, different common practices within a field may develop on how theories are tested. For example, the Theory of Planned Behaviour proposes that attitudes, self-efficacy, and injunctive norms are predicted by behavioural beliefs, control beliefs, and normative beliefs, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Ajzen, 1991</ref>). Yet, these sets of beliefs are rarely measured in practice, with most researchers testing only attitudes, selfefficacy, and injunctive norms (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">Yuriev et al., 2020)</ref>. Similarly, some components of Protection Motivation Theory proposed by the original author, such as response costs (i.e., the perceived costs associated with engaging in a behaviour), are only rarely included in tests or discussions of the model <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Kothe et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Milne et al., 2000)</ref>. When common practices deviate from the original formulation of the theory, it may be unclear for researchers which components of the theory should or should not be included, and how to determine why (not).</p><p>In sum, theories in psychology can be ambiguous because specific constructs are interpreted and tested in different ways, and because it can be unclear which combination of constructs represent a theory.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Specifying relationships between constructs</head><p>A second area where theories can be ambiguous is in the description of the relationships between constructs. First, relationships between two constructs in theories are often described in terms of the direction and causality of the relationship, meaning that the relationship is described as either positive or negative (e.g., higher self-efficacy is positively associated with stronger intentions to act pro-environmentally; <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Edwards &amp; Berry, 2010)</ref>. When a mathematical model is specified on the basis of a theory, it is however necessary to specify the shape of the relationship between two constructs, too (i.e., whether the relationship is linear, sigmoidal, curvilinear, or another shape, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Schlüter et al., 2017)</ref>. This information is often not provided within the original propositions of theories, and in studying environmental behaviour, researchers rarely make and test hypotheses about the shape of relationships between constructs. When testing theories, researchers often by default test linear relationships, which is the underlying assumption in many standard statistical tests <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Edwards &amp; Berry, 2010)</ref>. There is thus very little information available about the shape of the relationships between constructs in a model. Importantly, specifying different relationship shapes (i.e., linear, curvilinear or sigmoidal) does affect the results of models representing the drivers of environmental behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Beckage et al., 2018)</ref>, and this aspect of constructing a model should therefore not be ignored or overlooked.</p><p>Second, descriptions of theories are often unclear on how more complex relationships between three or more constructs should be interpreted or tested. For example, within the Theory of Planned Behaviours it unclear whether self-efficacy should be considered a moderator of the relationship between intentions and behaviour, a direct predictor of behaviour, or both (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Hagger et al., 2022)</ref>. In addition, it is not clearly specified what relationships and/or interactions between attitudes, self-efficacy, and perceived subjective norms are expected <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Hagger et al., 2022)</ref>. As another example, Protection Motivation Theory proposes that risk perception, self-efficacy, and outcome efficacy interact as follows: if [outcome efficacy] and/or self-efficacy are high, then increases in [risk perception] will produce a positive main effect [on behaviour]. On the other hand, if outcome efficacy and/or self-efficacy are low, then increases in [risk perception] will either have no effect or a boomerang effect, actually reducing intentions <ref type="bibr">(Rogers, 1983, p. 156)</ref> <ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">foot_2</ref> . Yet, this description does not clearly state what relationship is expected if self-efficacy is high and outcome efficacy is low, or vice versa, nor does it specify when no effect or a boomerang effect may be expected <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">(Weinstein, 1993)</ref>. What the exact configuration of a theoretical model looks like is therefore not always self-evident.</p><p>Third, many theories do not specify how relationships between constructs may develop over time (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">Vancouver et al., 2018)</ref>. Psychological theories are often focused on describing when a particular behaviour is more or less likely to occur, and the relationships between constructs and the dependent variable often represent a snap shot at a particular point in time. Far fewer theories explicitly consider how the relationships between constructs and the dependent variable may develop over time, for example by considering feedback loops after a behaviour occurs <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Davis et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Roe, 2008)</ref>. The aim of IAMs is typically to examine how outcomes develop over time, and specifying potential feedback loops between determinants and behaviour in the model is therefore essential <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">(van Vuuren et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Hence, ambiguity can currently arise regarding how changes over time should be represented. Some examples of potential feedback loops were already discussed above within the MAP-framework. For example, engaging in pro-environmental behaviour could strengthen people's environmental self-identity, which in turn motivates people to engage in more proenvironmental behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">(Van der Werff et al., 2013)</ref>. Within some of the other discussed theories, it is also possible that feedback loops occur, even though they are not explicitly part of the original model. For example, within the framework of the Theory of Planned Behaviour, it has been proposed that if people have acted pro-environmentally and had a good or bad experience with it, this could influence their attitudes towards the behaviour, which in turn affects the likelihood that they will engage in the behaviour again <ref type="bibr">(Albarracín &amp; Wyer, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr">Fishbein, 2010)</ref>. Similarly, by engaging in pro-environmental behaviour people may realise the behaviour was more or less difficult to perform than anticipated, which could increase or decrease their sense of self-efficacy, respectively <ref type="bibr">(Fishbein, 2010)</ref>. More systematically theorizing about and testing such temporal dynamics is thus a critical step for theory development.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Strength of relationships and boundary conditions of theories</head><p>A final reason where theorizing may be ambiguous is because the strength of relationships between model variables is rarely predicted or specified. As previously mentioned, relationships between constructs within theories are mostly described in terms of their direction only (i.e., which variable predicts which, and is it a positive or negative relationship). Yet, to specify a mathematical model, it is also necessary to indicate the strength of the relationship between constructs. One way to circumvent this problem could be to rely on meta-analyses to gain information on the average strength of relationships between constructs across studies. However, many meta-analyses report a high level of heterogeneity between studies (Linden &amp; Honekopp, 2021 see for example <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">van Valkengoed &amp; Steg (2019)</ref>), which can often only be explained to a limited extent because there is limited theorizing and empirical evidence on which moderators may account for this heterogeneity <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Bryan et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Linden &amp; Honekopp, 2021)</ref>. Hence, it is typically unclear how strong of a relationship between constructs can be expected, and under which conditions we can expect that the relationship is stronger or weaker. The inability to account for this heterogeneity may be partially due to the fact that many theories do not clearly specify the boundary conditions under which the theory is most applicable <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Bryan et al., 2021)</ref>. The lack of theorizing on the strength of the relationships under different conditions, and the often observed but unaccounted heterogeneity between studies thus forms a final source of ambiguity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Recommendations to reduce ambiguity in theories and their application</head><p>To reduce these sources of ambiguity and increase the precision of theories in environmental psychology used to explain environmental behaviour, we offer three recommendations to social and behavioural scientists conducting theoretical and empirical work on the driver of environmental behaviour. First, we recommend that researchers testing theories should be much more transparent and explicit in describing their theory. At minimum, researchers need to clearly describe 1) which constructs they consider part of the theory and justify why they focus on that specific set of constructs, 2) offer clear and precise labels, definitions and operationalisations for the constructs they are examining (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Flake &amp; Fried, 2020)</ref>, and 3) make clear which relationships they expect between constructs, including possible moderation and mediation effects, specifying the strength of these relationships and considering possible feedback loops between determinants and behaviour.</p><p>Second, we recommend that researchers in environmental psychology strive to work towards a consensus on how theories are understood and tested, which is regularly updated to accurately reflect the current state of the art. Review articles can contribute to this by tracking developments in theories over time, and by mapping differences in the understanding and application of a theory. Expert consensus methods, such as expert group meetings and workshops, can subsequently be used to address and resolve potential discrepancies in how researchers understand and test theories, and to develop agreed-upon configurations of theories and definitions of key constructs (see for example <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Hagger et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Michie et al., 2005)</ref>. Importantly, to reduce the variability between studies in terms of the measurement of constructs, it is important that the research community develops and agrees upon the use of standardized and validated measures to assess constructs, as well as using the same label for each construct consistently (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Flake &amp; Fried, 2020)</ref>. The current state of art should ideally also be easily accessible and updatable, for example via regularly updated review articles, community wikis, textbooks or encyclopaedia projects <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">(Steg &amp; de Groot, 2019)</ref>.</p><p>Third, there is a need for novel theorizing to address some of the sources of ambiguity.</p><p>Specifically, theorizing is necessary on the functional form of relationships between constructs within a theory, the strength of those relationships, and how relationships develop over time. It is also necessary that heterogeneity between studies is better accounted for, which requires more exact specification of the boundary conditions of theories. Novel theorizing also invites novel empirical work to test such propositions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>Lifestyle change represents a promising demand-side solution that can deliver substantial reductions in CO2 emissions, lowering the need for risky carbon capture and storage technologies. and increasing the likelihood that we can limit climate change to below 2°C. To understand and maximize the potential of lifestyle changes, it is important to accurately model the drivers of these behavioural changes in IAMs. We see great potential for environmental psychology to contribute key insights to modelling the drivers of lifestyle changes, but there are key barriers that need to be addressed before this can happen in a systematic and valid way. Specifically, there needs to be better guidance for researchers on how to navigate the expansive environmental psychology literature, and theories need to become more precise in order to reduce ambiguity and to ease the process of rendering theories mathematically. We hope the MAP-framework we introduced in this article, as well as our recommendations for making theories more precise, can contribute to reducing these barriers and expedite the systematic uptake of environmental psychology literature in the modelling of the drivers of lifestyle change. Yet, the recommendations in this article will only be useful if they are taken up by environmental psychologists and integrated assessment modellers alike. The modelling of the drivers of environmental behaviour can only succeed if there are close collaborations between integrated assessment modellers and environmental psychologists. So far, environmental psychologists have hardly been involved in the discussion on the modelling of lifestyle changes, and we therefore urge them to more actively participate, for example by more explicitly considering implications for modelling in their theorizing and studies, and by taking up the research recommendations provided in this article to make theorizing more specific. We ask integrated assessment modellers to continue inviting environmental psychologists and other social and behavioural scientists to contribute to their efforts, for example by asking for recommendations or feedback on which theories are most suitable to modelling particular behaviours of lifestyle changes, or on how particular theories can best be represented. Such collaborations can represent win-win situations that benefit both the behavioural realism of lifestyle models, improve the development and refinement of psychological theories, and ultimately provide critical insights on how to utilize the potential of lifestyle change to limit climate change to 2°C.</p><p>Table <ref type="table">1</ref> Overview of the original purpose and key constructs of the eight behavioural theories within the MAP-framework, and suggested application of the theory in modelling.</p></div>
