<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Friendships help people achieve many fundamental adaptive functions. As such, one might theorize that humans are designed to seek out and maintain as many friendships as possible. However, with time and energy as finite resources, humans face a unique challenge in determining the number of friendships they can sustaindo they prioritize maximizing friendship quantity (potentially at the expense of investment in each friend, thus compromising friendship quality), or do they prioritize friendship quality (potentially at the expense of friendship quantity)? Here, we introduce the novel concept of friendship promiscuity -an individual difference in preference for a wide friendship network and desire for friendship intimacy -and develop a tool for measuring this trait. Across 5 studies (N Total = 5,707), we created and confirmed the Friendship Promiscuity Scale's factor structure, its test-retest reliability, and construct and discriminant validity. Critically, we demonstrate that the scale achieves measurement invariance across three geographically diverse countries and is associated with friend-seeking motivation and behaviors beyond relevant controls. The scale offers a novel method for assessing an unexplored aspect of friendships and provides a crucial tool for understanding this valued relationship.</p></div>

However, this perspective overlooks the costs associated with seeking and maintaining one's friendships <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Newman et al., 2018)</ref>. High-quality friendships require high levels of investment. Moreover, even maintaining low-quality friendships or engaging in friend-seeking behaviors requires time and resources that cannot be spent pursuing other adaptive goals (e.g., caring for one's offspring). These constraints naturally limit the number of friendships one can actively pursue and maintain <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Duck et al., 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Dunbar, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Hall, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Hill &amp; Dunbar, 2003)</ref>.</p><p>Consequently, friendship strategies favor investment in friends who provide the most benefit. Specifically, we seek friends with benefit-generating traits (e.g., specialized skills, generosity) and those who value us above others because such friends are more willing to provide benefits to us <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Ayers et al., 2023</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Ayers et al., , 2024;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Felmlee et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Hall, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Krems &amp; Conroy-Beam, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Tooby &amp; Cosmides, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Williams et al., 2022)</ref>. However, friendship strategies also favor investments that minimize the costs to oneself. This tension between maximizing friendship-derived benefits and limiting potential costs may manifest in a trade-off between the quality and quantity of friends, such that people have preferences for one friendshipmaking strategy over the other. We propose that this preference-what we call friendship promiscuity-exists as an individual difference that regulates friendseeking and maintenance behaviors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fundamental trade-offs and individual differences</head><p>Friendship promiscuity may be akin to other individual differences stemming from life-history trade-offs. For example, due to the time and energy associated with raising offspring, individuals can invest in having many offspring at the expense of investing more heavily in any one offspring, thus compromising offspring quality <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Becker, 1960;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Becker &amp; Lewis, 1973;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Stearns, 1976</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Stearns, , 1992))</ref>. Compared to other animals, humans tend to invest more in the quality of their offspring than in quantity <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Lawson &amp; Mace, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Walker et al., 2008)</ref>. However, even within human societies, people differ in the extent to which they favor quality over quantity of their offspring, thus giving rise to individual differences in mating effort versus parental investment strategies stemming from this trade-off <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Walker et al., 2008)</ref>.</p><p>Another fundamental trade-off is the quality versus quantity of sexual partners, conceptualized as investment in short-term uncommitted romantic relationships versus long-term committed relationships <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Gangestad &amp; Simpson, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Simpson &amp; Gangestad, 1991)</ref>. This trade-off gives rise to individual differences in sociosexual orientation (SOI). For example, men report more unrestricted SOI than women <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Blasco-Belled et al., 2022)</ref>. Moreover, people with unrestricted SOIs are more likely to have sex earlier in their relationships, have more than one sexual partner at a time, place less importance on commitment, intimacy, and attachment <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Banai &amp; Pavela, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Simpson &amp; Gangestad, 1991)</ref>, and ultimately experience reduced relationship stability compared to people with more restricted SOIs <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Mattingly et al., 2011)</ref>. In turn, these individual differences impact the extent to which people invest in the quality versus the quantity of romantic partners <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Mattingly et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Penke &amp; Asendorpf, 2008)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Why the sociosexual orientation trade-off may be similar to friendship preferences</head><p>Given the similarity and overlapping features between friendships and romantic relationships (K. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Campbell et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Reis et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">VanUitert &amp; Galliher, 2012)</ref>, friendship preferences resemble mating preferences with few notable differences. For example, under monogamous mating, there is a trade-off between having one long-term partner and multiple partners p <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Buss &amp; Schmitt, 2019)</ref> In contrast, , people can be friends with more than one person at a timeboth pursuing new friendships while maintaining current friendships-without being considered a violation of the relationship. Additionally, while mating preferences have some stability across the lifespan, it is also possible that friendship preferences are more temporally determined and flexible, given their social environment. Therefore, it stands to reason that we should be able to map tradeoffs in friendship preferences using trade-offs in mate psychology as a template.</p><p>As life history strategy gives rise to adaptive strategies, psychological mechanisms may help to mediate the trade-offs humans experience. SOI, specifically, may be particularly well-suited as a template since it indexes differences in behaviors, attitudes, and desires surrounding mating orientation.</p><p>These differences vary across human groups and regulate both make-seeking and mate retention behaviors. Similarly, humans have an implicit desire to affiliate <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Kenrick et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Neel et al., 2016)</ref>, can sustain different numbers of friendships (S. G. B. <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Roberts et al., 2008)</ref>, and desire to acquire new friends <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(de Matos Fernandes et al., 2025)</ref>. Therefore, friendship promiscuity may result from a quantity vs. quality trade-off regarding people's attitudes, desires, and behavior surrounding friendships preferences.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Overview of Studies</head><p>Our goal in these studies was to create and validate a measure pertaining to the novel construct of friendship promiscuity following best practices <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(DeVellis, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Morgado et al., 2017)</ref>. In Studies 1a-1d, we generated items and explored the factor structure of friendship promiscuity. Study 2 confirmed the factor structure of the scale. Study 3 demonstrated test-retest reliability, as well as concurrent, convergent, and discriminant validity. Study 4 examined predictive validity. Finally, Study 5 examined the generalizability of the scale across three countries.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Openness and data transparency</head><p>These studies were not pre-registered. We ran factor analyses with the Lavaan package for R <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Rosseel, 2012)</ref>, bivariate and partial correlations, as well as linear/logistic regressions with SPSS V29, and mixed-effects models with the MIXED procedure for SAS V9. Data and analysis code for Studies 1-5 are available upon request.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Studies 1a-1d</head><p>The first iteration of the Friendship Promiscuity Scale was adapted from the revised SOI scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Penke &amp; Asendorpf, 2008)</ref>. Following the structure of the SOI, items were expected to load onto three interrelated latent constructs: behaviors surrounding making friends, attitudes towards low-commitment friendships, and desire for emotional intimacy with friendships. Across a diverse set of samples (N Total = 3488, collected between 2019-2020; see Supplemental Information S1), we found that a two-factor model was a better fit to the data, with one factor indexing preference for a wide friendship network, and the second indexing desire for friendship intimacy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 2</head><p>We aimed to confirm the factor structure from Study 1d because two items were removed from the scale due to low factor loadings (Tables <ref type="table">S7-S8</ref>). Thus, a limitation was whether the factor structure was replicable. Additionally, we examine associations between friendship promiscuity and demographic characteristics (i.e., age, sex, relationship status; see SI S2).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants and measures</head><p>During Fall 2020, 1089 participants completed the study as part of a larger pre-screening survey administered to psychology undergraduates (M age = 18.90, SD age = 2.14). Participants completed the Friendship Promiscuity Scale and reported demographic information (64.4% women; 54.2% White, 4.4% Black/African American, 20% Hispanic/Latino, 1.5% Native American, 16.4% Asian/Asian American, 3.5% Middle Eastern; socio-economic background (1 = Upper class, 5 = Working class): M = 2.88, SD = 0.94).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>A Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) replicated the two-factor structure observed in Study 1d (N = 1066, 𝜒 2 (34) = 241.60, p &lt; 0.001, CFI = 0.96, TLI = 0.95, RMSEA = 0.07, CI 90% [0.07, 0.08], SRMR = 0.05; Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>), with items 1-6 creating preference for a wide friendship network (M = 4.40, SD = 1.26; Cronbach's 𝜒 = 0.85, mean inter-item r = 0.48), and items 7-10 creating desire for friendship intimacy (M = 4.64, SD = 1.45; Cronbach's 𝜒 = 0.89, mean inter-item r = 0.67). Note. Item 1 was scored as 1 = 0, 7 = more than 20, items 2-10 were scored as 1 = strongly disagree, 7 = strongly agree. The table shows standardized factor loadings (standard errors in parentheses). Wide network preference and desire for friendship intimacy factors were positively correlated (r = 0.53). Table <ref type="table">S9</ref> shows inter-item correlations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 3</head><p>Study 2 documented that the proposed factor structure is internally valid. The next step, therefore, was to assess the scale's test-retest reliability and its validity against a battery of relevant constructs, including individual differences, social network characteristics, and in quality vs. quantity of friendship measures. Broadly, we predicted that friendship promiscuity would be associated with larger social network size, higher scores on quantity over quality of friendship, and lower scores on quality over quantity of friendship measures.</p></div>

Returning participants completed this study 5-8 weeks later (N = 370; M age = 19.27, SD age = 2.80; 71.9% women; 57.68% White, 3.74% Black/African American, 17.23% Hispanic/Latino, 1.12% Native American, 17.6% Asian/Asian American, 2.25% Middle Eastern; parent's household income (1 = Under $15,000, 4</p><p>= $35,001-$50,000, 9 = Over 200,000): M = 6.15, SD = 2.25).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures</head><p>We provide a summary of measures here, but a complete description can be found in SI S2.2. Participants first reported their wide network preference (M = 4.29, SD = 1.27, 𝜒 = 0.85), and desire for friendship intimacy (M = 4.60, SD = 1.36, 𝜒 = 0.85). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Individual</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Test-retest reliability</head><p>Participants generated a unique identifier in Study 2 and were asked to report this same code in Study 3, yielding 232 matches (62.7%). Wide network preference and desire for friendship intimacy were strongly correlated between studies (r's = 0.70 to 0.77, p's &lt; 0.001). Moreover, there were no mean differences between studies for wide network preference (t(231) = 0.18, p = 0.85, M diff = 0.01) or desire for friendship intimacy (t(231) = 0.21, p = 0.83, M diff = 0.01), indicating friendship promiscuity was temporally stable across 5-8 weeks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Convergent, discriminant, and concurrent validity</head><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref> shows the bivariate and partial correlations of friendship promiscuity with the relevant constructs. Positive associations between wide network preference and extraversion as well as higher scores on quantity vs quality of friendship measures demonstrate convergent validity. Moreover, wide network preference was associated with higher friendship quantity, and having more friends and close friends willing to help. This association was weaker for the number of family and acquaintances willing to help, thus demonstrating concurrent validity. In contrast to our expectations, wide network preferences were weakly to moderately associated with quality vs. quantity of friendship measures, suggesting that people with stronger preference for wide friendship network may not necessarily invest less in their friendships. Additionally, wide network preference was weakly to moderately associated with self-perceived mate value and sociosexuality, showing some degree of discriminant validity but suggesting a potential confound in the association between friendship promiscuity and friend-seeking behaviors (see Study 4).</p><p>Desire for friendship intimacy, after controlling for wide network preference, was uniquely associated with worse friendship outcomes, including lower friendship quantity, fewer friends willing to help, and lower satisfaction with the quality and quantity of friends. Notably, this negative association was nearly twice as strong for quantity of friends, suggesting that desire for friendship intimacy is not just about lacking intimacy with friends, but about wanting intimacy with many friends.</p><p>Additionally, desire for friendship intimacy was uniquely associated with greater desire for interpersonal value, and lower extraversion and self-perceived friendship value. While demonstrating discriminant validity, these associations indicate that lack of friends and loneliness may be potential confounds in the association between friendship promiscuity and friend-seeking behaviors (see Study 4). Desire for interpersonal value </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 4</head><p>The primary goal of this study is to assess the predictive validity of friendship promiscuity. Study 3 showed that wide friendship network preference was associated with extraversion, sociosexuality, and more satisfaction with friendships.</p><p>In contrast, desire for friendship intimacy was associated with lower self-perceived friendship value, neuroticism, and less satisfaction with friendships. Here, we examine whether friendship promiscuity is associated with friend-seeking behavior, controlling for potential confounds identified in Study 3. Moreover, we further examine the discriminant validity of friendship promiscuity against generalized anxiety and fundamental social motives. Finally, we aim to replicate key associations among friendship promiscuity and measures of individual differences, social network characteristics, and quality versus quantity of friendship.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants and measures</head><p>We recruited an undergraduate student sample during Fall 2021 (N = 457, M age = 19.05, SD = 1.88, 65.8% women; parents' household income (1 = Under $15,000, 9 = Over 200,000): M = 6.04, SD = 2.30). Participants first reported their wide network preference (M = 4.27, SD = 1.27, 𝜒 = 0.86), and desire for friendship intimacy (M = 4.59, SD = 1.35, 𝜒 = 0.84), followed by friend-seeking motivation (Are you interested in the possibility of getting in touch with other students who have participated in this study?; 1 = not at all, 7 = very interested; M = 2.96, SD = 1.84, Min = 1, Max = 7), and friend-seeking behaviors (Sharing email: If you would like to share your contact information with other students please enter your email address below; 0 = no email (71.3%), 1 = email provided (28.7%); Writing message:</p><p>Is there anything about yourself that you would like to share with other students who also choose to share their contact information with you?; 0 = no message (84.2%), 1 = message provided (15.8%)). Participants then answered the same measures as in Study 3 2 (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">S12</ref>). Rather than the BFI-2-XS, which showed low internal consistency in Study 3, here participants completed the 44-item BFI Inventory <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(John et al., 1999)</ref>. Additionally, participants completed the Generalized-Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale (𝜒 = 0.91; <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Spitzer et al., 2006)</ref>, revised UCLA Loneliness Scale (𝜒 = 0.95; <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Russell et al., 1980)</ref>, and a portion of the Fundamental Social Motives Inventory <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Neel et al., 2016)</ref>, which measures individual differences in adaptive social goals, including independence (M = 4.43, SD = 1.29, 𝜒 = 0.87), exclusion concern (M = 4.47, SD = 1.48, 𝜒 = 0.90), affiliation (M = 4.75, SD = 1.04, 𝜒 = 0.80), status seeking (M = 4.06, SD = 1.14, 𝜒 = 0.77), and mate seeking (M = 3.94, SD = 1.54, 𝜒 = 0.87).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>How might friendship promiscuity motivate friend-seeking behavior?</head><p>We conducted exploratory analyses to uncover plausible mechanisms by which friendship promiscuity might motivate friend-seeking behaviors. We reasoned that if friendship promiscuity is a feature of the mind that maximizes the size of one's friendship network, then outputs (e.g., friend-seeking behaviors) should be regulated by (a) one's desire for friendship intimacy and preference for a wide friendship network and (b) cues informing one's level of success in attaining the desired outcome. Specifically, we investigated friendship quantity and dissatisfaction with friendship quantity (i.e., I am happy with the number of friends that I have -reversed scored) as candidate cues regulating friend-seeking behaviors.</p><p>Moderation analyses showed that desire for friendship intimacy was associated with higher dissatisfaction with quantity of friends (𝜒 = 0.23, SE = 0.04, p &lt; 0.001, CI 95% [0.14, 0.32]), even when controlling for quality of friends, which was associated with lower dissatisfaction with quantity of friends (𝜒 = -0.26, SE = 0.04, p &lt; 0.001, CI 95% <ref type="bibr">[-0.35, -0.18]</ref>) and moderated the effect of desire for friendship intimacy on dissatisfaction (𝜒 = -0.14, SE = 0.05, p = 0.005), such that desire for friendship intimacy was associated with higher dissatisfaction with quantity of friends for people with less (-1SD) friends (𝜒 = 0.37, SE = 0.06, p &lt; 0.001, CI 95%</p><p>[0.25, 0.49]) but not for people with more (+1SD) friends (𝜒 = 0.09, SE = 0.07, p = 0.20, CI 95% [-0.05, 0.23]) (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2a</ref>).</p><p>Moreover, desire for friendship intimacy (𝜒 = 0.34, SE = 0.14 p = 0.02, OR = 1.41, CI 95% [1.06, 1.84]) and dissatisfaction with quantity of friends (𝜒 = 0.37, SE = 0.12, p = 0.002, OR = 1.45, CI 95% [1.15, 1.82]) were associated with sharing one's email. While we find no main effect of wide network preference on sharing one's email (𝜒 = -0.07, SE = 0.14, p = 0.58), wide network preference moderated the effect of dissatisfaction with quantity of friends on sharing one's email (𝜒 = 0.29, SE = 0.12, p = 0.01), such that dissatisfaction with quantity of friends was associated with sharing one's email for people high (+1SD) on wide network preference (𝜒 = 0.66, SE = 0.18, p &lt; 0.001, OR = 1.93, CI 95% [1.36, 2.72]) but not for people low (-1SD) on wide network preference (𝜒 = 0.08, SE = 0.15, p = 0.61, OR = 1.08, CI 95%</p><p>[0.80, 1.46]) (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2b</ref>). Combined, results suggest that desire for friendship intimacy is associated with greater dissatisfaction with one's quantity of friends, especially among people with few friends. In turn, this greater dissatisfaction is associated with friendseeking behavior, but only for people with moderate-to-high wide friendship network preference. Said differently, among people with moderate-to-high desire for friendship intimacy, only those reporting high friendship quantity reported being satisfied with their number of friends. In turn, those reporting higher satisfaction were less likely to share their email regardless of their wide friendship network preference -presumably because they have already achieved the goal of maximizing friendship network size (see SI S4.2 for tests of this indirect effect).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 5</head><p>Study 4 demonstrated that friendship promiscuity is associated with friendseeking behaviors over and above potential confounds (i.e., extraversion, loneliness, fundamental social motives).

Thus, here, we examine the measurement invariance of friendship promiscuity in a geographically diverse sample of adults.</p><p>Additionally, we further examine discriminant and predictive validity against relational mobility -the extent to which people have opportunities to form new social relationships, as well as the freedom to choose their social partners. This socio-ecological factor varies across cultures, and explains affiliative patterns that allow people to form new relationships with many social partners, such as friendship intimacy and prosociality <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Kito et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Milfont et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Thomson et al., 2018)</ref>. Therefore, we examine whether friendship promiscuity is associated with intimacy -indexed by perceived relationship closeness -and prosocial behavior controlling for relational mobility. We also explored whether relational mobility moderates these effects, such that friendship promiscuity would be more strongly associated with closeness and prosociality when relational mobility is high, because affiliation in such contexts is more likely to result in new relationships. To increase credibility, participants were instructed to enter their own, as well as the targets' email addresses (except for the stranger). In reality, one participant was selected at random to receive the $50 USD prize at the end of the study.</p></div>

However, the scale did not achieve strong invariance, indicating that composites should be centered by country mean (rather than the sample mean), and between-country mean comparisons are not supported (S5.1; Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">S13</ref>).</p></div>

Replicating Studies 3-4, wide network preference (controlling for desire for intimacy) was more strongly correlated with higher friendship quantity (r = 0.24, p &lt; 0.001) than desire for friendship intimacy (controlling for wide network preference; r = -0.09, p = 0.02).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Friendship promiscuity is associated with affiliative tendencies</head><p>Prosociality. Mixed-effects regressions (see SI S5.2 for modelling specifications) showed that wide network preference (𝜒 = 4.34, p &lt; 0.001), and desire for intimacy (𝜒 = 4.10, p &lt; 0.001) were associated with giving more tickets in separate models, but not when included in the same model (p's &gt; 0.06). We therefore averaged them together to create a friendship promiscuity composite (𝜒 = 4.48, SE = 1.02, p &lt; 0.001, CI 95% [2.48, 6.48]). The positive effect of friendship promiscuity holds (𝜒 = 2.69, SE = 1.05, p = 0.01, CI 95% [0.63, 4.75]) controlling for friendship quantity (𝜒 = 0.23, SE = 1.02, p = 0.82, CI 95% [-1.76, 2.23]), relational mobility (𝜒 = -0.91, SE = 0.98, p = 0.35, CI 95% [-2.85, 1.02]), the between-person effect of closeness (𝜒 = 5.80, SE = 1.03, p &lt; 0.001, CI 95% [3.78, 7.83]), and the within-person effect of closeness (𝜒 = 9.95, SE = 0.51, p &lt; 0.001, CI 95% [8.94, 10.96]).</p><p>We then included a friendship promiscuity × relational mobility interaction to the controls model, finding a significant interaction (𝜒 = -2.09, p = 0.02). However, further analyses probing the interaction by each component of relational mobility revealed this interaction was driven by opportunities to meet (𝜒 = -2.94, SE = 0.90, p = 0.001, CI 95% <ref type="bibr">[-4.70, -1.18]</ref>), not freedom to choose relationships (𝜒 = -0.66, SE = 0.90, p = 0.46, CI 95% <ref type="bibr">[-2.44, 1.11]</ref>). The interaction model (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">S17</ref>) improved fit relative to the controls model (Δ𝜒(1) 2 = 10.20, p &lt; 0.01), accounting for 2.72% of the between-person variance, and 29.82% of the within-person variance (ICC = 0.51). In contrast to our expectations, we found that friendship promiscuity was associated with giving more tickets among people perceiving lower (-1SD) opportunities to meet new people (𝜒 = 6.35, SE = 1.51, p &lt; 0.001, CI 95% [3.38, 9.33])</p><p>but not among those perceiving higher (+1SD) opportunities (𝜒 = 0.47, SE = 1.25, p = 0.70, CI 95% [-1.98, 2.93]) (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3a</ref>). Results suggest that, when opportunities to meet new people are scarce, friendship promiscuity could motivate people to place greater effort in affiliation to use the few opportunities they have to form friendships. When opportunities to meet new people are abundant, the cost of finding new friends is low, therefore people may not need to put in as much effort to secure new friendships.</p><p>Relationship closeness.

However, we do not find a friendship promiscuity × relational mobility interaction on closeness for neither the global composite (𝜒 = -0.04, p = 0.38), meeting factor (𝜒 = -0.04, p = 0.32), or choosing factor (𝜒 = -0.03, p = 0.44). Friendship promiscuity (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">S18</ref>) improved fit relative to an intercepts-only model (Δ𝜒(1) 2 = 211, p &lt; 0.001), accounting for 4.80% of the between-person variance and 1.74% of the within-person variance (ICC = 0.51). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Discussion</head><p>The goal of these studies was to investigate the motivations people have for forming friendships as they juggle the trade-off between the number of friends they can sustain and the amount they can invest in each friendship. To this end, we created and validated the Friendship Promiscuity Scale across 5 studies. Factor analyses revealed the underlying two-factor structure. We then demonstrated testretest reliability across a 5-8 week timespan, concurrent, convergent, and discriminant validity across a battery of theoretically relevant measures; and predictive validity as well as cross cultural generalizability, such that friendship promiscuity was associated with friend-seeking behaviors and motivations over and above pertinent controls across geographically diverse samples.</p><p>Our results suggest that friendship promiscuity indexes preferences for having a wide friendship network and desire for intimacy with many friends. While individual differences like sociosexuality index a trade-off between two ends of a spectrum (i.e., quality vs. quantity), the Friendship Promiscuity Scale does not appear to capture this bipolarity -rather, the scale measures unidimensional preferences and motivations for making more friends without sacrificing preference and motivation for investing in friends. This highlights an important facet of friendships, as one can both maintain current friendship while seeking new friendships without violating norms found among committed romantic relationships <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Buss &amp; Schmitt, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Gangestad &amp; Simpson, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Simpson &amp; Gangestad, 1991)</ref>.</p><p>Although the Friendship Promiscuity Scale does not seem to capture a quality vs. quantity trade-off, this does not mean that this trade-off does not exist. For instance, when one's friend directs attention away from us in favor of a rival, people experience friendship jealousy that can trigger both maintenance and dissolution behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Krems et al., 2021)</ref>. Therefore, promiscuously friendly people might, inadvertently, lose investment from current friends when they seek new friendships.</p><p>Notwithstanding, the Friendship Promiscuity Scale offers a reliable tool for measuring preferences and motivations for making many friends across cultures, and for making predictions about friend-seeking, making, and maintenance behaviors that could ultimately reveal the nature of a quality vs. quantity of friendships trade-off.</p><p>The relationships that we observed with the Friendship Promiscuity Scale and theoretically relevant constructs also align with previous research. For example, extraverted <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Pollet et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Zell et al., 2014)</ref> and conscientious people <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Lee et al., 2010)</ref> tend to have larger and more connected support networks, while people higher in neuroticism have smaller networks and fewer close friends <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Harris &amp; Vazire, 2016)</ref>. We also found that wide network preference was positively associated with affiliation, mate-seeking, and status-seeking <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Kenrick et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Neel et al., 2016)</ref>, consistent with the notion that wider networks provide more friends to help individuals reach these goals. Similarly, people with high friendship value are typically preferred by others as friends <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Krems &amp; Conroy-Beam, 2020)</ref>, and we observed that these individuals also reported higher wide friendship network preference .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations and future directions</head><p>One unexpected limitation is that the Friendship Promiscuity Scale does not appear to index a quantity vs. quality of friendship trade-off in the same fashion as other trade-offs. For example, friendship promiscuity was associated with higher perceived intimacy and commitment with friends (Studies 3-4). Similarly, friendship promiscuity was (weakly) associated with more guarding and retention behaviors in a friend-poaching scenario (Study 3; Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">S10</ref>). Therefore, it remains unclear whether people necessarily sacrifice investment in friends when they prefer wider networks, or whether they invest more in affiliation overall, potentially at the expense of other adaptive functions.</p><p>While posing challenges for determining whether people adopt one strategy over the other, this lack of dichotomy highlights an important aspect of friendships.</p><p>Unlike monogamous mating, where costs of investing in many partners can be high (e.g., relationship dissolution) people are not constrained to pursuing only one friend at a time or having to prioritize quality while sacrificing quantity (or viceversa) to the same extent. Future research could investigate the nature of this trade-off using explore-exploit dilemmas where participants must decide between finding new friendships or exploiting existing ones to reveal whether friendship promiscuity predicts a trade-off in exploring over exploiting <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Tsang et al., 2025)</ref>.</p><p>Additionally, investigating ecological factors could reveal when people are more likely to favor one strategy over the other. For example, in resource scarce urban environments, people may prefer to invest in few high quality, over many shallow, friendships <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Adams &amp; Plaut, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Oishi &amp; Kesebir, 2012)</ref>. However, it is worth noting that this association may be reversed in subsistence societies because wider networks allow people to more effectively pool risks <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Cronk &amp; Aktipis, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Jaeggi et al., 2016)</ref> or gain prestige <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Ready &amp; Power, 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Another limitation is that we do not know the long-term implications of friendship promiscuity. For example, people tend to prune their social networks as they age (Bruine de Bruin et al., 2020; English &amp; Carstensen, 2014) However, since we do not have longitudinal data, we cannot examine whether people move from a more promiscuous friendship-making strategy when they are younger to a less promiscuous strategy when they are older. Alternatively, friendship promiscuity might attenuate this pruning effect, with those endorsing a more promiscuous strategy maintaining a wider network even as they age.</p><p>Another important future direction will involve investigating the extent to which friendship promiscuity tracks ideal or actual friendship preferences. While we could not assess if friendship network preferences closely tracked ideal network composition, it is possible that those below their ideal friendship network composition -whether in terms of quantity or intimacy -endorse more promiscuous friendship-making strategies. Indeed, we find that desire for intimacy was associated with friend-seeking behavior for people with higher wide network preference but only if they reported having fewer friends, suggesting desire for intimacy up-regulates friend-seeking behavior when people are below their ideal friendship quantity and down-regulates friend-seeking when above the ideal quantity. However, how promiscuous friendship-making strategies might affect intimacy with one's friends will require investigating both individual and partnerrated perceptions of intimacy</p></div>

Across 5 studies, we outlined the creation of the Friendship Promiscuity Scale -a novel tool for measuring wide friendship network preference and desire for intimacy with many friends -its factor structure, reliability and validity, and friend-seeking motivations and behaviors associated with this new construct in geographically diverse samples. The scale offers a reliable tool for measuring preferences and motivations for making many friends across cultures, and for making predictions about friend-seeking, making, and maintenance behaviors that could ultimately reveal the nature of a quality vs. quantity of friendships trade-off.</p><p>extroversion and network structure in the formation of effective informal support networks.

Participants were compensated with $1.00 for their time. Study 1c. Here we administered the friendship promiscuity scale to 767 psychology undergraduates (M age = 19.24, SD age = 2.74, 53.7% women; 55% White, 5% Black/African American, 18% Hispanic/Latino, 2% Native American, 16% Asian/Asian American, 2% Middle Eastern, 1% "other"; income-related socioeconomic status M = 2.90, SD = 1.0 [1 = Upper class, 5 = Working class]) who received partial course credit for their participation.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 1a</head><p>In addition to the 9 items adapted from the Sociosexual Orientation Inventory, we included the following two items</p><p>: (1) I want to have a lot of different friendships with a lot of different people, even if it means that I don't get to know all of them very well (item 10). This item was developed to capture a central issue in partner choice, that time and resources are limited (Noë and Hammerstein 1994; Noë and Hammerstein 1995). Consequently, investments towards building a large network of friends may come at a cost to an individual's ability to make investments towards any one single individual within an existing network. And (2): How long do you have to know someone before calling that person a friend? (Item 11). We expected that people who score high on friendship promiscuity would require less time/investment from new potential partners to recognize them as friends and that this preference would form part of a promiscuously friendly psychology.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Exploratory factor analyses suggest a 2-factor model</head><p>To investigate alternative solutions, we next ran a principal component analysis. Results and visual inspection of a scree-plot suggested a two-factor solution may best fit the data, with the first component explaining 68.33% of the variance, the second 20.52%, and a third only 3.03% of the variance.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 1b</head><p>We made a number of changes to the scale based on results from Study 1a.</p><p>First, Item 2 (How many of your friendships have only lasted a very short period of time) was removed given its low factor loadings (0.06-0.23). Second, although Item 3 (How often are you friendly to people without really being interested in being friends with them?) also loaded weakly (0.14-0.15), we decided to modify the item to the following: How often do you treat other people as if they were your friend, even when you may not really be interested in being friends with them?. The concern with the previous item was that "friendly" may have been interpreted as simply being agreeable. The modified wording is meant to reflect willingness to maintain rapport with others in order to sustain a larger, albeit more shallow, network of friends.</p><p>Third, Item 6 (I do not want to begin making friends with a person until I am sure that we can have a long-term friendship), was modified to I do not want to begin investing in a friendship with someone new until I am sure that we can have a long-term friendship. This item is intended to reflect willingness (or lack thereof) to invest in new potential friendships even when the risk of them being short-lived is high. Fourth, responses to Item 1 (How many new friends have you made in the past 12 months?) were recorded as an open-ended response, rather than a slider ranging from 0-50, in order not to limit participants in their responses. Lastly, some items were moderately skewed, and thus, the scales were reduced from 9-point to 7-point Likert scales.</p><p>Table S1b. Friendship Promiscuity Descriptives (Study 1b).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The two-factor solution replicated in an older sample of participants</head><p>Considering the changes we made to the scale, we began these analyses by running another principal component analysis. Results and visual inspection of a scree-plot suggest a one or two-factor solution may fit the data best, with the first component accounting for 78.44% of the variance, the second for 6.93%, and a third only 3.79% of the variance.

Items 6 and 11 were reversedscored. The Friendship Promiscuity scale (version 3) is a two-dimensional construct In this study, responses to Item 1 (How many new friends have you made in the past 12 months?) ranged from 0 to 200, exhibiting much higher levels of variance (696.38) compared to other items, which ranged from 1.49 to 2.94. As a result, confirmatory factor analyses using the raw values of Item 1 yielded a nonpositive definite Hessian matrix. To reduce the variance in Item 1, we divided responses by 10. A one-factor CFA fitted the data poorly (𝜒 2 (27) = 216.75, p &lt; 0.001, CFI = 0.72, TLI = 0.62, RMSEA = 0.10, CI 90% [0.09, 0.11], SRMR = 0.07).

Results indicate that two dimensions, one reflecting preference towards maintaining a wide network of friends (e.g., I enjoy making causal friendships with many different people), and a second reflecting chronic yearning towards making new friends (e.g., How often do you imagine yourself trying to be friends with someone you weren't friends with before?) best explains the data.

Moreover, men and women did not differ in their preference for a wide network, reflecting the fact that, despite sex differences in preference for one's friendship's traits (e.g., loyalty vs. instrumental support; <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Ayers et al., 2023</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Ayers et al., , 2024))</ref>), friendships serve important adaptive functions for both men and women <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Williams et al., 2022)</ref>. We also found that preference for a wide network was not associated with relationship status, suggesting this preference is independent of mating motivations.</p><p>Unexpectedly, however, single people interested in dating (compared to partnered people or those uninterested in dating) reported higher longing for making new friends, suggesting this factor is shaped by both affiliation and mating motivations. Here, we examine correlations between sociosexuality and friendship promiscuity to further assess if friendship promiscuity is independent from mating motivations. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Overview of studies 1a-1d</head><p>In Study 1a we tested whether the Friendship Promiscuity scale followed a three-factor solution. Instead, analyses showed that a two-factor model yielded more interpretable results. Based on exploratory factor analyses from Study 1a, in Study 1b we removed and modified items, and ran additional exploratory factor analyses on the modified item list employing an older US sample. In Study 1c we confirmed the two-factor model observed in Studies 1a-1b, however, the scale showed low-construct reliability. In Study 1d, we made additional changes to the scale, showing that this final version of the scale was high on construct reliability, and the two-factor structure of the scale replicated in an international sample of participants.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>Study 1a. We first administered the Friendship Promiscuity scale to a sample of incoming psychology undergraduates at a public university in the US (N = 1868, M age = 19.01, SD age = 2.75, 59.6% male; 53% White, 5% Black/African American, 20% Hispanic/Latino, 2% Native American, 15% Asian/Asian American, 2% Middle Eastern, 1% "other"; income-related socio-economic status M = 2.88, SD = 0.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>S4.2 Additional results</head><p>In addition to our focal analyses, we ran a moderated mediation model using the PROCESS (V4.1) macro model 21 for SPSS V.29, with desire for friendship promiscuity predicting sharing one's email address via higher dissatisfaction with quantity of friends, where number of friends moderated the effect of desire for friendship intimacy on dissatisfaction with quantity of friends, and preference for a wide friendship network moderated the effect of dissatisfaction with quantity of friends on sharing one's email address. All covariates were mean centered and standardized.</p><p>When doing this, we found that the positive indirect effect of desire for friendship intimacy on sharing one's email via dissatisfaction with quantity of friends was conditional on both quantity of friends and preference for a wide λ choosing = 0.88). The only exception was that item 4 (There are few opportunities for these people to form new friendships) did not load onto the meeting factor in Egypt (λ = 0.20, p = 0.078). The metric invariance (i.e., equal factor loadings) model (Δ𝜒(20) 2 = 37.5, p = 0.01), and the scalar invariance (i.e., equal loadings and intercepts) model (Δ𝜒(18) 2 = 67.4, p &lt; 0.001) had worse fit than the configural model.</p></div>
