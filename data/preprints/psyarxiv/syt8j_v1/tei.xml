<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Gender differences in interoceptive awareness-awareness of internal bodily signals such as heartbeat perception-have been suggested, with some findings indicating behaviourally reduced but subjectively enhanced awareness in women, though these findings are still contentious. This study aimed to comprehensively examine gender differences in three aspects of interoceptive awareness: behavioural accuracy, subjective confidence, and relationship between them (i.e., metacognition). We used a modified heartbeat counting task that prohibited estimation strategies and increased the number of trials up to 20. Using data from 74 healthy young adults (39 women and 35 men), we evaluated gender differences and practice effects for each measure via Bayesian linear mixed models, controlling for individual heart rate and trial duration on a trial-by-trial basis. Contrary to previous research, the results revealed no reduced interoceptive accuracy in women; instead, higher interoceptive accuracy score was associated with shorter trial durations and lower heart rates regardless of gender. Moreover, women exhibited underconfidence about their performance, and therefore lower metacognition scores, compared to men. Trial repetitions moderated women's lowered metacognition but did not affect accuracy or confidence. These findings highlight potential physiological and psychological confounding factors in the heartbeat counting task, such as heart rate and reporting style, and emphasize several cautions for studying gender differences in interoceptive awareness.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p>Interoception refers to the processes involved in sensing, integrating, and interpreting internal bodily states. As a fundamental aspect of human cognition, interoceptive awareness-or the subjective experience of interoceptive signals, such as heart contractions or digestive processes-plays a critical role in shaping our emotions, decision-making, and bodily self <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Consequently, individual differences in interoceptive awareness have garnered significant interest in relation to cognitive abilities and mental health conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref>. Recent studies have particularly highlighted the importance of gender 1 differences in interoceptive awareness <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>, as these disparities could potentially explain a range of gender-specific health outcomes and psychopathological manifestations. The present study aims to comprehensively investigate gender differences in cardiac interoceptive awareness, or heartbeat perception, which remains a subject of controversy.</p><p>Previous research has depicted a complex picture regarding gender differences in interoceptive awareness. For example, women tend to exhibit a more sensitive response to experimentally induced pain, interoceptive awareness regarding nociceptive sensations, compared to men <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>. Women's hypersensitivity is related to both pain threshold and intensity reporting <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>,</p><p>but see <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> for a null result. These gender differences may align with the higher incidence of mental health disorders involving alterations in bodily awareness in women <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>. Notably, interoceptive somatic complaints including nausea, headache, and dizziness are more prevalent in women than in men <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. Such manifestations often rely on misinterpretations or amplifications of actual bodily sensations, presumably associated with atypical interoceptive awareness <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref>.</p><p>When considering more neutral interoceptive awareness, rather than affective, it has been discussed if women exhibit reduced behavioural interoceptive accuracy or sensitivity-the perceptual ability to detect one's own interoceptive signals. Some studies have revealed men's superiority in interoceptive accuracy across several bodily signals, including cardiac, respiratory, and gastric sensations in laboratory settings <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, while others have collaterally indicated no gender difference in such ability <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. Two recent meta-analyses revealed a 1 Throughout this paper, we use the term "gender" rather than "sex," except when referring specifically to purely biological or physiological distinctions between sexes. Similarly, we refer to "men" and "women" in general discussions but use "males" and "females" when addressing purely biological or physiological aspects. This distinction reflects the multi-dimensional nature of interoceptive awareness, which integrates psychological factors such as emotional states and individual dispositions alongside physiological processes.</p><p>weak but statistically significant decline in women's cardiac interoceptive accuracy <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31]</ref>, suggesting a gender difference in interoceptive accuracy regarding visceral sensations when averaged across a large population. As outlined, there are conflicting findings regarding gender differences between affective and non-affective interoceptive awareness, leading to speculation that while women are more subjectively attuned to their interoceptive signals when affective, they may also be more prone to misinterpreting them. This dichotomy raises intriguing questions about gender differences in interoceptive metacognition-the metacognitive ability to monitor one's own perceptual skill regarding interoception <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>.</p><p>Notably, gender differences in cardiac interoceptive awareness-the most frequently used paradigm in human interoception research-have not been tested across interoceptive accuracy, subjective confidence in task performance, and metacognitive ability as proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. A multidimensional examination is necessary because previous studies have typically used the heartbeat counting task to investigate individual and gender differences in interoceptive awareness, primarily focusing on its accuracy aspect <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34]</ref>. Recent criticism indicated that this task suffers from estimation bias and knowledge about the number of heartbeats <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36]</ref>. Therefore, in the present study, we employed a modified version of the heartbeat counting task that explicitly prohibits estimation strategies <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37]</ref>. Additionally, we increased the number of trials from typically four or six up to twenty. By doing so, we assessed individual interoceptive accuracy, confidence in performance, and metacognitive ability in a trial-by-trial manner, allowing us to test gender differences in each variable. Increasing the number of trials also enabled us to test the practice effect of heartbeat detection and to rule out changes in individual heart rate as a covariate, which had not been previously considered.</p><p>We primarily hypothesized that women will exhibit lower interoceptive accuracy compared to men, as previous studies have suggested <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31]</ref>. It was also expected that women may demonstrate under-or over-confidence about their interoceptive accuracy as they exhibit subjectively enhanced but behaviourally decreased interoceptive awareness, leading to decreased metacognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. However, null results were also anticipated, as recent findings using the Phase Adjustment Task suggest partial superiority of women in interoceptive accuracy <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, while no gender differences in interoceptive accuracy or metacognition were observed in the respiratory domain <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>A total of 78 healthy volunteers (41 women, 37 men) took part in the experiment. All were undergraduate students at Hokkaido University and were physically and mentally healthy, with no history of diagnosed mental health disorders (e.g., anxiety, depression) or chronic physical conditions (e.g., cardiovascular disease). Participants also confirmed that they were not taking any medications that might affect physiological or psychological functioning. These criteria were implemented to minimise potential confounding factors, as mental and physical health conditions are known to influence interoceptive processes and physiological states <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. They received a 1000 Japanese yen Amazon gift card for their participation in the one-hour experiment. One man could not perceive any heartbeat throughout twenty trials, and was therefore excluded from further analysis. Another man and three women were excluded from our statistical analysis due to noisy physiological recordings in some trials, which made it impossible to calculate their heart rates correctly. Therefore, our final sample consisted of 74 participants (39 women, 35 men), with an average age of 20.16±1.51 years. While results of prior meta-analyses imply larger sample sizes needed (e.g., more than 210) to robustly detect subtle gender differences in interoceptive accuracy <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31]</ref>, our sample size was reasonable to explore medium-to-large effects within the practical and ethical constraints of this study. Specifically, a power analysis indicated that 34 participants per group is sufficient to detect an effect size of d = 0.7 with 80% power and a significance level of α = 0.05. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. This study was carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and its amendments. The Ethics Committee of Hokkaido University approved the experimental protocol.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Heartbeat counting task</head><p>We used the heartbeat counting task to assess participants' interoceptive accuracy (the perceptual ability to detect internal bodily sensations), confidence (subjective confidence in interoceptive accuracy), and metacognition (metacognitive ability regarding their interoceptive accuracy). Pulse oximetry (IWS920, Tokyo Devices) was placed on the left index finger of participants to record each heartbeat. Participants sat in a comfortable chair with their arms on the desk in front of them and were instructed not to lean against a backrest. We asked participants to adjust their posture and the location of the apparatus to avoid feeling a bloodstream or pulse externally (i.e., outside of their body), as such pulsations can be detected in fingertips when using a pulse oximetry, potentially inflating interoceptive accuracy scores <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>. A monitor and mouse were placed on the desk for participants to respond during the task.</p><p>In each trial, participants silently counted the number of heartbeats that occurred in a given duration (15 s, 25 s, 35 s, or 45 s) by focusing on the heartbeat sensations. Immediately after the trial period, they reported the counted number via a visual slider indicating a digit.</p><p>Participants were explicitly instructed to count only the heartbeats they detected for sure and were prohibited from using any strategies unrelated to the internal detection of heartbeats, such as taking their pulse or estimating the number of heartbeats based on time. While these instructions were designed to minimise estimation bias, they relied on participants' self-report and verbal compliance. To address this, we administered a post-task questionnaire to assess whether participants had adhered to the instructions or used estimation strategies. This questionnaire, combined with the explicit instructions, aimed to reduce confounding effects and biases that could inflate heartbeat counting scores, as noted in prior research <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41]</ref>. After reporting the counted number, participants rated their confidence in their performance using a visual slider ranging from 0 ("No perception") to 100 ("Full perception") <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. The confidence rating screen displayed the question "How confident were you?" along with the slider. The instruction to participants was to rate their confidence in terms of the proportion of heartbeats they believed they had accurately perceived during the trial. For example, participants were told to select 100 if they felt they had perceived all the heartbeats in the trial or 50 if they believed they had perceived approximately half, asking them to estimate the number of heartbeats they perceived at this stage. By aligning the confidence scale with participants' subjective perceptions, the task captured the alignment or discrepancy between subjective confidence and behavioural performance.</p><p>Participants completed a total of 20 trials, five trials for each duration, presented in a randomized order. The entire task, including these components and rest periods, typically took 35 to 40 minutes to complete. After every five trials, a rest message was displayed on the screen, instructing participants to take a break. During these breaks, participants were required to remain seated and avoid unnecessary movements or activities to minimise changes in cardiac activity. Breaks lasted as long as needed, and participants could proceed to the next trial by pressing a key when they felt ready. While breaks were mandatory in the sense that participants could not skip directly to the next trial, the duration of the breaks was participant-initiated, ensuring individual readiness while maintaining consistency in the task flow.</p><p>The number of trials was largely increased compared to previous studies to quantify the robust relationship between interoceptive accuracy and confidence (i.e., interoceptive metacognition) while accommodating rest periods to reduce cognitive fatigue <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>. For example, Garfinkel and colleagues originally proposed interoceptive metacognition by calculating Pearson's correlation coefficient between interoceptive accuracy and confidence over six trials <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43]</ref>. This correlation-based method, while influential, is suboptimal due to the high statistical uncertainty and potential bias introduced by such a small sample size. For instance, calculating a correlation coefficient based on six pairs, assuming a medium-to-large population correlation coefficient (ρ = .50), results in a standard error of .43, leading to unreliable estimates. In contrast, we calculated interoceptive metacognition on a trial-by-trial basis, using the difference between interoceptive accuracy and confidence for each trial. This trial-based approach, while novel, improves statistical robustness by leveraging the increased number of trials and provides richer information about metacognitive patterns, specifically distinguishing between underconfidence and overconfidence. Scores above 0 reflect overconfidence, while scores below 0 indicate underconfidence relative to actual heartbeat perception.</p><p>We analyzed the photoplethysmography (PPG) signals using the Heartpy module in Python <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>. First, we checked the completeness of the PPG signals recorded during task trials for each participant. We applied a third-order low-pass filter to the PPG time series for denoising, then scrutinized each trial for erroneous or missing peak detection. The number of heartbeats and heart rate were calculated using the preprocessed PPG time series for each trial of each participant. Thereafter, we calculated interoceptive accuracy, confidence, and metacognition for each participant for each trial, based on the recorded and reported number of heartbeats and subjective confidence in task performance. The formulations with a lowercase i as an identical trial number are as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">𝐼𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑜𝑐𝑒𝑝𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒 𝐴𝑐𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑦 𝑖 = (1 - |𝑅𝑒𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑑𝑒𝑑 𝑁𝑏𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑠 𝑖 -𝑅𝑒𝑝𝑜𝑟𝑡𝑒𝑑 𝑁𝑏𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑠 𝑖 | 𝑅𝑒𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑑𝑒𝑑 𝑁𝑏𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑠 𝑖 ) 𝐼𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑜𝑐𝑒𝑝𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒 𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑓𝑖𝑑𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑒 𝑖 = 1 100 (𝑆𝑢𝑏𝑗𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒 𝑅𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑖 ) 𝐼𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑜𝑐𝑒𝑝𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒 𝑀𝑒𝑡𝑎𝑐𝑜𝑔𝑛𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝑖 = 𝐼𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑜𝑐𝑒𝑝𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒 𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑓𝑖𝑑𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑒 𝑖 -𝐼𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑜𝑐𝑒𝑝𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒 𝐴𝑐𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑦 𝑖</formula><p>Scores of interoceptive accuracy and confidence typically range from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating more accurate heartbeat perception and stronger subjective estimate of one's own performance, respectively. However, the accuracy formula allows for the possibility of negative values if participants report more than twice the actual number of heartbeats, while such cases did not occur in the present study. The difference between them-interoceptive metacognition-could typically range from -1 to 1, where scores above 0 indicate overconfidence and scores below 0 reflect underconfidence relative to actual heartbeat perception. Importantly, while 20 trials may not suffice for certain metacognitive analyses requiring signal detection theory frameworks, it is reasonable for our trial-by-trial approach, which does not rely on these assumptions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Questionnaires</head><p>After completing the heartbeat counting task, participants filled in the Japanese version of the Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness (MAIA) for interoceptive sensibility <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46]</ref>, as well as a questionnaire regarding the strategy used during the heartbeat counting task. The MAIA comprises 32 statements describing daily experiences related to interoception (e.g., "When I am tense, I notice where the tension is located in my body").</p><p>Participants rated the extent to which these statements applied to them on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (never) to 5 (always). Individual dispositions towards bodily awareness were assessed as multidimensional components because the MAIA encompasses eight independent factors (noticing, not distracting, not worrying, attention regulation, emotional awareness, selfregulation, body listening, and trusting). The questionnaire was filled in via an online form, with the order of each statement randomized. A previous study found gender differences in five out of eight MAIA factors (noticing, not worrying, emotional awareness, body listening, and trusting) <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</p><p>We also asked participants to respond from 1 (not at all) to 7 (completely) to the questionnaire, assessing whether they used an estimation strategy during the heartbeat counting task, which has been shown to inflate interoceptive accuracy scores. Two items of the questionnaire were developed for this study (see Supplementary Material), with each item asking, "How did you estimate the number of heartbeats throughout the task?" and "Did you report only the number of heartbeats you perceived for sure?" Data from this questionnaire were missing for 6 male participants due to technical issues with the crowd service we used.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical analyses</head><p>All statistical analyses were conducted using JASP (version 0.18.3). Our primary focus was on examining gender differences in interoceptive awareness, utilizing both behavioral data and questionnaire responses. For the questionnaire data, Bayesian two-sample t-tests were conducted on each factor of the MAIA and items of the original questionnaire. Additionally, Bayesian one-sample t-tests were performed on two key items related to estimation strategies, using a test value of 4 as the midpoint of the 7-point scale. Scores significantly greater than 4</p><p>were interpreted as evidence of estimation bias, a threshold we considered reasonable for assessing adherence to task instructions. We used JASP's default prior (Cauchy distribution with a scale parameter of 0.707) for all Bayesian analyses. Bayes factors (BFs) were used to interpret gender differences: BFs greater than 3 indicated evidence for the alternative hypothesis, and BFs less than 0.33 supported the null hypothesis.</p><p>To investigate predictors of individual differences in interoceptive accuracy, confidence, and metacognition, we employed linear mixed models (LMMs), a flexible and robust statistical approach well-suited for hierarchical data structures, such as repeated measures within individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>. The fixed effects included gender, trial session, trial duration, heart rate during the trial (beats per minute), and the interaction between gender and session. Trial session (1-4) and trial duration (15 s, 25 s, 35 s, and 45 s) were treated as ordered factors. Random intercepts and random slopes for session and duration were included as random effects to account for within-participant variability across trials. This approach ensures that trial-level fluctuations and baseline differences are accurately represented within the hierarchical structure, reducing bias in parameter estimates <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>. Thus, the model specification was as follows:</p><p>𝑀𝑒𝑎𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑒𝑠 ~ 𝐺𝑒𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑟 + 𝑆𝑒𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛 + 𝐺𝑒𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑟: 𝑆𝑒𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛 + 𝐷𝑢𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 + 𝐻𝑒𝑎𝑟𝑡𝑅𝑎𝑡𝑒 + (1 + 𝑆𝑒𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛 + 𝐷𝑢𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛|𝑆𝑢𝑏𝑗𝑒𝑐𝑡)</p><p>Parameters were estimated using Bayesian methods. For the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, a burn-in of 2000 iterations was used, followed by 4000 samples from four chains. The adapt delta was set to 0.9, and the maximum tree depth was restricted to 10. The LMM allowed us to assess factors influencing interoceptive accuracy, confidence, and metacognition on a trial-by-trial basis. Specifically, we calculated four contrasts of interest: the gender difference (men vs. women) and practice effects (first two sessions vs. last two sessions)</p><p>for women, men, and the combined sample. This approach enabled precise quantification of gender differences and practice effects while accounting for confounding variables such as heart rate and trial duration. By incorporating 95% Credible Intervals (CIs) and Highest</p><p>Posterior Density Intervals (HPDIs), we transparently reported the uncertainty of our estimates,</p><p>showing that while substantial uncertainty existed for interoceptive accuracy, confidence and metacognition scores were estimated more reliably. HPDIs were calculated for each contrast to emphasise the most probable parameter values, focusing on regions of highest posterior density.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Group comparisons on the questionnaire data are presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>, indicating no supporting evidence for gender differences in MAIA subscales (BF10s &lt; 0.508) (also see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>).</p><p>Rather, we found supporting evidence for the null hypothesis (BF10s &lt; 0.33), suggesting no gender difference in noticing, not distracting, self-regulation, and body listening, which are contradictory to the results of <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. There was also no gender difference in the use of estimation strategy during the heartbeat counting task (BF10s &lt; 0.303). Importantly, the one sample t-tests revealed that participants did not estimate the number of heartbeats (BF10 = 2.192×10 21 ) and did report only the heartbeats they perceived for sure (BF10 = 1.863×10 12 ), ensuring a successful control for estimation bias by the modified instruction.</p><p>Individual and averaged scores in interoceptive accuracy, confidence, and metacognition are plotted separately for trial session and gender in Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B,</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref>, and 1D. Contrary to previous literature, the current results using Bayesian LMM did not support gender disparity in interoceptive accuracy. However, they did support women's underconfidence in their task performance and decreased metacognition compared to men. Specifically, higher interoceptive accuracy was predicted by the negative linear effect of trial duration (estimate = -0.027, 95%</p><p>Credible Intervals (CI) = [-0.043, -0.010]) and heart rate during trials (estimate = -0.006, 95% CI = [-0.008, -0.004]) (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>). We found no evidence supporting the effect of gender or practice by directly contrasting the marginal means (gender difference: estimate = 0.162, 95% HDPI = [-0.202, 0.552]; practice effect in women: estimate = -0.057, 95% HDPI = [-0.122 , 0.011]; practice effect in men: estimate = -7.500×10 4 , 95% HDPI= [-0.075, 0.066];</p><p>practice effect across groups: estimate = -0.057, 95% HDPI = [-0.154, 0.041]) (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>).</p><p>For interoceptive confidence, only the fixed effect of gender was predictive of data variance (estimate = 0.076, 95% CI = [0.011, 0.143]), while other factors were not (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>). The contrasts of marginal means revealed supportive evidence for a gender difference, with women showing lower confidence ratings compared to men (estimate = 0.429, 95% HDPI = [0.067, 0.812]). No supportive evidence for the practice effect was found in both men and women (practice effect in women: estimate = 0.049, 95% HDPI = [-0.010, 0.114]; practice effect in men: estimate = 0.031, 95% HDPI = [-0.037, 0.097]; practice effect across groups: estimate = 0.079, 95% HDPI = [-0.009, 0.173]) (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref>).</p><p>The last LMM indicated that heart rate during trials, and the linear, quadratic, and cubic effects of the trial session predicted individual differences in interoceptive metacognition (estimate for heart rate = 0.006, 95% CI = [0.004, 0.007]; estimate for the linear effect of session = 0.023, 95% CI = [0.008, 0.039]; estimate for quadratic effect = -0.027, 95% CI = [-0.046, -0.007];</p><p>estimate for quadratic effect = -0.018, 95% CI = [-0.034, -0.002]) (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>). There was a general trend of underconfidence in women compared to men relative to their actual perceptual performance (estimate = 0.248, 95% HDPI = [0.013, 0.513]). Moreover, supportive evidence for the practice effect was found in women (estimate = 0.109, 95% HDPI = [0.056, 0.161]) and across both genders (estimate = 0.143, 95% HDPI = [0.068, 0.221]), suggesting a moderation of the relative underconfidence in women, which was absent in men (estimate = 0.034, 95% HDPI = [-0.021, 0.091]) (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2C</ref>). We exploratory tested if the gender difference remains prominent in the later session, by contrasting men vs. women in session 3 and 4. The result indicated no gender difference in interoceptive metacognition in the later session (estimate = 0.086, 95% HDPI = [-0.035, 0.227]), suggesting a moderation effect of repeating trials in women.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>We investigated gender differences and practice effects in several aspects of interoceptive awareness, including accuracy, confidence, and metacognition, using the heartbeat counting task. Specifically, we increased the number of trials, allowing us to examine gender differences in practice effects on a trial-by-trial basis. Contrary to previous literature, the present Bayesian LMM, which simultaneously modeled the effects of gender, trial repetition, trial duration, and heart rate during trials, did not support the hypothesis of decreased interoceptive accuracy in women. Higher interoceptive accuracy was linearly predicted by shorter trial durations and lower individual heart rates during each trial, suggesting potential confounding factors. Instead, we found a gender difference in confidence and metacognition, with women exhibiting underconfidence in their heartbeat counting performance, resulting in lower interoceptive metacognition scores compared to men. We did not find supportive evidence for practice effects in heartbeat counting on interoceptive accuracy and confidence. However, trial repetition moderated underconfidence relative to actual accuracy in women but not in men.</p><p>This practice effect led to comparable interoceptive metacognition between genders in the later trials.</p><p>First and foremost, our results supported the null hypothesis, indicating no significant gender differences in behavioural interoceptive accuracy after accounting for potential confounds.</p><p>While some researchers have reported this gender difference <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49]</ref>, others have not <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. A recent meta-analysis revealed a small effect size in the heartbeat counting score <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>.</p><p>However, the data used in the meta-analysis likely did not account for potential confounding factors in heartbeat counting, such as heart rate and estimation bias <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36]</ref>, which are critical points regarding gender differences in interoceptive accuracy in the previous literature. Our findings indicate that trial duration and heart rate are precise predictors of interoceptive accuracy, emphasising the importance of addressing these factors to avoid erroneous conclusions about gender differences. Specifically, we observed that a faster heart rate during trials was consistently, albeit weakly, associated with a decrease in interoceptive accuracy, aligning with previous findings <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50]</ref>. Additionally, interoceptive accuracy was negatively associated with trial duration, consistent with reports that prolonged trials exacerbate declines in performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51]</ref>. This attenuation may reflect reduced attentional efficiency over time, a characteristic of heartbeat perception that is critical to consider when designing interoceptive tasks. Biologically, it is well-documented that females have a slightly but consistently faster heart rate compared to males <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>. In the current sample, women's heart rates were slightly higher than men's (women = 75.01±9.55; men = 72.40±10.58), although this difference was not evident (BF10 = 0.41). Therefore, along with our present behavioural results, we argue that the previously reported gender differences in interoceptive accuracy might be spurious, merely reflecting the sex difference in heart rate during the heartbeat counting task, as well as other confounding factors. This argument aligns with recent findings using the Phase Adjustment Task, which, being independent of heart rate, did not reveal a men's advantage in interoceptive accuracy <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>.</p><p>The present LMM revealed that women tended to be underconfident about their heartbeat counting performance and therefore had lower interoceptive metacognition scores compared to men. This consistent underconfidence aligns with broader literature suggesting that women often exhibit lower confidence in their cognitive and perceptual abilities than men, regardless of actual performance levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54]</ref>. Importantly, this finding aligns with the recent finding which revealed women's consistent underconfidence in the Phase Adjustment Task <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. Such gender differences in reporting style may reduce the number of perceived heartbeats reported in the heartbeat counting task, especially in studies where estimation strategies are not explicitly prohibited, potentially resulting in slightly decreased interoceptive accuracy in women in previous research <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. While men's advantage in the heartbeat discrimination task-a method less influenced by heart rate confounding-has been similarly reported, women's tendency toward underconfidence may result in inconsistent response patterns in this task. This, in turn, could lead to a higher occurrence of chance-level performance, a phenomenon observed in approximately half of participants in this task <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. Of note, this underconfidence towards heartbeat perception appears contradictory to clinical observations and psychosomatic literature, which report a higher prevalence of interoceptive symptoms in women and heightened sensitivity to pain stimuli, suggesting greater attention to interoceptive signals compared to men <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref>. We argue that the difference between the present findings and these clinical observations lies in the affective context of the interoceptive signals.</p><p>Specifically, women may exhibit heightened behavioural and subjective sensitivity to interoceptive signals associated with discomfort or negative affect (e.g., pain, palpitations, and gastrointestinal complaints), but not to affectively neutral signals such as resting heartbeats.</p><p>Based on our comprehensive examination, we argue that the previously reported decline in women's interoceptive accuracy might be explained by differences in heart rate and a tendency towards underconfidence. This necessitates distinguishing between affective interoceptive awareness, such as pain and somatic complaints, and neutral interoceptive awareness, such as heartbeat perception in lab studies. Although such discussions might sound trivial, they help reconcile the apparent discrepancy between reduced interoceptive accuracy and enhanced emotional awareness in women. For example, Prentice and colleagues struggled to explain this dichotomy by emphasizing the role of interoceptive accuracy in emotional awareness <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">55]</ref>.</p><p>When interoceptive accuracy is considered separately from the affective aspect of interoceptive awareness and noting the absence of gender differences, the story becomes clearer. That is, women possess comparable perceptual abilities regarding internal sensations but exhibit underconfidence compared to men, while being more sensitive to the subjective and affective aspects of interoceptive awareness. If so, future investigations into gender differences in interoceptive awareness should focus on psychological, social, and developmental factors, rather than perceptual ability <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref>.</p><p>The strength of the present study lies in the multidimensional investigation of interoceptive accuracy, confidence, and metacognition in a trial-by-trial manner using the modified instruction of the heartbeat counting task. This approach allowed us to model gender differences and practice effects simultaneously using Bayesian LMMs, while controlling for confounding variables such as heart rate, trial duration, and estimation bias. Some readers might suspect that trial repetition could result in participant fatigue and cognitive loss. However, evidence from a previous study revealed that 20 to 30 trial repetitions did not affect performance, as shown in the present results, while 60 trials can reduce participant concentration <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>. The heartbeat counting task has faced recent criticisms regarding its validity <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41]</ref>. While we acknowledge its limitations, such as the reliance on verbal compliance and the inability to capture the exact timing of heartbeat perception, we believe the task retains several strengths. It allows tracking of heartbeat perception with minimal interference from exteroceptive cues, provides sensitivity to large individual differences, and demonstrates reasonable test-retest reliability in prior research <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">60]</ref>. In the present study, we addressed known limitations by implementing strict instructions to minimise estimation strategies and administering a post-task questionnaire, which indicated minimal reliance on estimation.</p><p>Additionally, by explicitly quantifying the uncertainty of each predictor, the Bayesian LMM approach provided clear and interpretable results even within the limitations of our sample size, strengthening our findings regarding gender differences and potential confounding factors in interoceptive awareness. Still, we acknowledge the absence of a behavioural control task as a limitation, as compliance with the instructions cannot be independently verified. One remaining issue with the heartbeat counting task is its inability to capture the exact timing of heartbeat perception, which might differ between men and women. Therefore, other tasks that can assess perceptual timing relative to actual sensations, such as the heartbeat tapping task <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref>, might be administered to further investigate gender differences in interoceptive awareness.</p><p>While no single task can perfectly measure interoceptive accuracy, we believe that the heartbeat counting task, when used carefully and critically as in this study, continues to provide meaningful insights into interoceptive processes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>We did not find evidence supporting gender disparity in interoceptive accuracy in the heartbeat counting task. Our results revealed that a faster heart rate during the task reduces interoceptive accuracy regardless of gender. Additionally, we found that women tend to exhibit underconfidence in their task performance compared to men.</p><p>These findings suggest that previously reported decreases in women's interoceptive accuracy might be spurious, potentially reflecting physiological differences between men and women, as well as differences in their reporting styles. Our study highlights the importance of controlling for confounding factors such as heart rate and trial duration when investigating individual differences in interoceptive awareness using the heartbeat counting task. Future research should focus on psychological, social, and developmental factors to better understand gender differences in interoceptive awareness, particularly in relation to the affective aspects.   defined: gender differences (men vs. women) over four trial sessions (W&lt;M); practice effects (latter two sessions vs. initial two sessions) in women (W), in men (M), and in both women and men (W&amp;M). Each parameter was estimated by Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling. The models included trial duration, heart rate, and the interaction between gender and session as fixed effects, with random intercepts and random slopes for each variable modeled as random effects. A) All 95% credible intervals for contrasted estimates of marginal means in interoceptive accuracy contained zero, indicating no gender difference or practice effect in either men or women. B) The 95% credible intervals for gender differences did not contain zero, suggesting general underconfidence in women. C) The 95% credible intervals for gender differences, practice effects in women, and practice effects in the whole sample did not contain zero, though the lower limit of gender difference was close to zero (0.013).</p></div>
