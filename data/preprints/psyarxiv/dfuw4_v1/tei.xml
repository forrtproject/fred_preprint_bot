However, the social impacts of using synchrony and AI decision agents in video interviews have not been investigated. Drawing on media richness theory and social interface theory, this study employed a novel experimental design to compare human ratings and job applicants' response behaviours between the SVI and AVI settings and compare job applicants' fairness perception between the AVI setting and the AVI setting using an AI decision agent (AVI-AI). The results from 180 observations revealed that 1) first impression and physical appearance significantly affected structured interview ratings regardless of whether the video interview was synchronous; 2) compared with SVIs, AVIs lessened the primacy effect on physical appearance and initial impression among human raters; 3) job applicants had indistinguishable fairness perceptions regarding synchrony (SVI vs. AVI) and decision agent (human vs. AI); and 4) applicants exhibited less favourability towards AVIs than towards SVIs.</p><p>Findings from this experimental comparison, including recommendations for practice and future research on human resource selection, technology education, and social computing, are</p></div>

AVIs allow pre-hire interviewing to occur any time and anywhere in the world, and employers can use AVIs to interview an unlimited number of job candidates and record their answers automatically (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Brenner, Ortner, &amp; Fay, 2016)</ref>. In addition, AVIs enable employers or recruiters to fastscreen or skip certain candidates <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Torres &amp; Gregory, 2018)</ref>. With regard to AI-based decision agents <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Ötting &amp; Maier, 2018)</ref>, predictive models can be built to short-list candidates when human evaluators of video interviews are in demand (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Rasipuram, Rao, &amp; Jayagopi, 2016)</ref>.</p><p>While both AVIs and AI-based decision agents have attracted increasing attention and are used in employment screening <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Rao, Rasipuram, Das, &amp; Jayagopi, 2017)</ref>, AI video interview solutions represent a promising alternative that combines the advantages of both (e.g., <ref type="bibr">HireVue, 2018)</ref>. AI involves "intelligent systems that act and reason as humans in a specific domain" <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Martı ńez-Miranda &amp; Aldea, 2005)</ref>. AI video interviews integrate the functions of both AVIs and AI and use a combination of visual and audio recognition techniques in tandem with machine learning to determine which applicants most resemble the ideal candidate (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Celiktutan &amp; Gunes, 2017)</ref>. In addition to screening multiple applicants at once, AI video interview software can match the right candidates with the right positions by auto-assessing the candidates' verbal <ref type="bibr">Suen, H.

To increase the availability of personnel resources, this cutting-edge technology has emerged and begun to displace traditional long-distance telephone interviews and conference interviews <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Torres &amp; Mejia, 2017)</ref>. However, the use of different video interview modalities (synchronous vs. asynchronous) and different decision agents (human vs. AI) may elicit different responses from both interviewers and job applicants (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Haan, Ongena, Vannieuwenhuyze, &amp; De Glopper, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Ötting &amp; Maier, 2018)</ref>; <ref type="bibr">Straus, Miles, and Laurie (2001)</ref> referred to these as unintended social impacts.</p><p>As with a variety of technology applications in employment interviews, there is a gap between the use of different video interviews for job candidate screening and research on the effects of these technologies <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Naim, Tanveer, Gildea, &amp; Hoque, 2018)</ref>. Although they may include the same interview questions, different interview modes lead to different reactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Zhang, Kuchinke, Woud, Velten, &amp; Margraf, 2017)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Langer, König, and Krause (2017)</ref> examined applicant reactions and interviewer ratings for both AVIs and SVIs and suggested that future studies should investigate how applicant reactions to and interviewer ratings of humanrated interviews and automatically rated interviews differ.</p><p>The present study investigated the synchrony effect by comparing human interviewer ratings and applicants' attitudes between the AVI and SVI settings. This study also investigated the AI decision agent effect by comparing applicants' responses between the AVI and AVI-AI settings. One focus of our study was how synchrony affects human ratings of applicants' <ref type="bibr">Suen, H. Y., Chen, M. Y. C., &amp; Lu, S. H. (2019)</ref>. Does the use of synchrony and artificial intelligence in video interviews affect interview ratings and applicant attitudes?

Past research has found that initial impressions and applicants' physical appearance affect interviewer ratings regardless of interview structure and mode (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Nestler &amp; Back, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Torres &amp; Gregory, 2018)</ref>. However, these studies were based solely on either video recordings or face-to-face interviews. To the best of our knowledge, no study has attempted to compare the effect of initial impression and physical appearance on interview ratings between the SVI and AVI settings. Furthermore, this study examined applicant reactions to different video interview modalities and decision agents because applicant perceptions influence not only applicants' perceived organizational attractiveness but also their intentions to accept the job, recommend the organization to others, or withdraw from the selection process <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Guchait, Ruetzler, Taylor, &amp; Toldi, 2014)</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">The synchrony effect on interview ratings</head><p>According to social information processing theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Walther, 2011)</ref>, in a computer-mediated environment (such as video interviews), a stranger (such as an interviewer or rater) observes and interprets the explicit or implicit cues exhibited by others and makes inferences regarding their characteristics in a span of a few minutes. The cues or attributes, such as physical appearance, are commonly used by interviewers to make inferences about an interviewee with whom they have no acquaintance <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Nestler &amp; Back, 2013)</ref>. Interviewers also utilize cues to form an initial impression and consider it along with physical appearance to determine their interview ratings <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(DeGroot &amp; Motowidlo, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Swider, Barrick, &amp; Harris, 2016)</ref>; however, most initial impressions do not predict job performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Eisenkraft, 2013)</ref>.</p><p>According to the lens model <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Brunswik, 1956)</ref>, when an observer has a more positive perception of a target's observable cues (e.g., appearance or initial impression), the observer will render a more positive judgement (e.g., interview rating) of the target in a consistent manner during an actual interaction or when viewing video clips <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Nestler &amp; Back, 2013)</ref>. Empirical studies have also shown that initial impressions and physical appearance influence interviewer ratings more strongly than professional factors in any interview media and structural format <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Swider et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Torres &amp; Gregory, 2018)</ref>. Therefore, we argue that the synchrony effect (SVI vs. AVI) will not influence the interviewer's judgement regarding the relationship between an applicant's initial impression / appearance and his or her qualifications in video interviews. Thus, we propose the following two hypotheses: H1: An interviewer's initial impressions of an applicant will be positively correlated with interview rating regardless of whether the video interview is synchronous.</p><p>H2: An applicant's physical appearance will be positively correlated with interview rating regardless of whether the video interview is synchronous. <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Straus et al. (2001)</ref> found that different types of job interview modalities influence interviewers' evaluations differently. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Daft and Lengel's (1986)</ref> media richness theory, types of media differ from one another in terms of "information richness". A medium is said to possess high information richness if it has a broad range of criteria. There are four criteria that contribute to information richness <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Apers &amp; Derous, 2017</ref>): (a) the capacity for immediate feedback between the sender and receiver in an interview process; (b) the number of cues and signals that can be transmitted through the medium; (c) the level of personalization, which is the ability to convey a sense of personal focus; and (d) language variety regarding whether the medium allows for the use of simple language versus complex language.</p><p>Suen, H. Y., Chen, M. Y. C., &amp; Lu, S. H. (2019). Does the use of synchrony and artificial intelligence in video interviews affect interview ratings and applicant attitudes? Computers in Human Behavior, 98, 93-101. <ref type="url" target="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2019.04.012">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2019.04.012</ref> 6</p><p>When we applied media richness theory in the context of this study, we found that SVIs exhibited more information richness than AVIs for the following reasons: (a) Asynchronous interviews offer low capacity for immediate feedback, as they involve one-way asynchronous interactions rather than two-way synchronous interactions (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Torres &amp; Mejia, 2017)</ref>. (b) In the synchronous setting, an interviewee can interact with an interviewer, and there are more opportunities to observe both verbal and nonverbal cues provided by the interviewee (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Langer et al., 2017)</ref>. (c) Compared with AVI settings, in SVI settings, interviewers have more opportunities to utilize different personal communication styles tailored to different interviewees (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Janghorban, Roudsari, &amp; Taghipour, 2014)</ref>, although employers can customize the look and information for targets in AVI settings. (d) Both interviewers and interviewees are better able to understand and decipher ambiguous or complex messages in SVI settings than in AVI settings (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Hassell &amp; Cotton, 2017)</ref>. Based on the above, compared to AVI, SVI leads to more personal interaction, which may lead to a greater media richness effect. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Chapman and Webster (2001)</ref> found that scoring of job applicants is determined by the information richness of the interview modality because information richness affects how human interviewers judge an interviewee's attributes and their post-interview impression by controlling initial impression. However, the greater the richness of information in the interview modality is, the greater the number of non-valid cues that are compatible with the interviewers' initial evaluation, such as physical appearance and initial impression, will be used by interviewers to form selection decisions during the interview. This phenomenon is called the impressional primacy effect (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Florea, Valcea, Hamdani, &amp; Dougherty, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Springbett, 1958)</ref>. That is, people opt for evaluations that confirm their existing beliefs <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Lord, Ross, &amp; Lepper, 1979)</ref>. In other words, information from the initial evaluation will be weighted more heavily in the interview rating in SVIs than in AVIs. In accordance with media richness theory and the impressional primacy effect, we argue that synchrony affects the relationships between applicant physical appearance and both initial impression and interview rating. Accordingly, the third and fourth hypotheses are proposed: H3: Synchrony moderates the influence of applicants' initial impression on interview score.</p><p>H4: Synchrony moderates the influence of applicants' appearance rating on interview score.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Synchrony effect on applicant reactions</head><p>According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Long's (2001)</ref> social interface theory, when the computer interface is more akin to a human, it can facilitate human-computer interaction as well as human-human interaction.</p><p>Therefore, respondents tend to treat computer interfaces like social actors in video-enhanced surveys <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Gerich, 2012)</ref>, and user responses become more similar to socially desirable responses compared to face-to-face interviews <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Haan et al., 2017)</ref>. According to media richness theory, although employment selection procedures requiring face-to-face interaction are more difficult to replace through technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Stone, Deadrick, Lukaszewski, &amp; Johnson, 2015)</ref>, given sufficient interaction between interviewees and interviewers, video interviews can achieve a similar level of intimacy to that of face-to-face interviews <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Shin, Liu, Jang, &amp; Bente, 2017)</ref>. In the context of video interviewing, synchrony influences applicants' reactions to the interviewers and the interview process <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(McCarthy et al., 2017)</ref>. Applicants are more likely to evaluate the selection tool as favourable; that is, they will have a positive attitude after using the tools when they experience humanization during the selection process <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Guchait et al., 2014)</ref>. Therefore, applicants are more likely to perceive the interview as less favourable in AVI settings than in SVI settings because they interact with a real person behind the screen in an SVI, while they interact with a machine in an AVI (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Langer et al., 2017</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Gilliland's (1993)</ref> applicant reaction model shows that applicants will perceive more procedural justice when they have more opportunity to respond to interview questions immediately, can engage in two-way communication, and are treated with warmth and respect.</p><p>Since there are fewer opportunities to respond, provide immediate feedback and engage in human interaction in an AVI than in an SVI <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Honkaniemi, Tolvanen, &amp; Feldt, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Langer et al., 2017)</ref>, applicants tend to view the interview procedure as unfair when conducted via asynchronous media <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Blacksmith, Willford, &amp; Behrend, 2016)</ref>. Therefore, we propose the following hypotheses: H5: Applicants will perceive AVIs less favourably than SVIs. H6: Applicants will perceive AVIs to be less fair than SVIs.</p></div>

However, machine learning can also reproduce human biases if the developers of such algorithms do not pay close attention to the data and do not adequately train and validate their algorithms (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Caliskan, Bryson, &amp; Narayanan, 2017)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Ötting and Maier (2018)</ref> argued that AI decision agents may influence employee attitudes, such as procedural justice perceptions, because the decision procedure involves less transparent algorithms with less reciprocation behaviour.

As issues could occur during data collection in the experiment (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Langer et al., 2017)</ref>, we continued solicitation until our sample consisted of 180 Chinese members from the organization, while the sponsor committed to referring suitable applicants' profiles to specific employer(s) based on the <ref type="bibr">Suen, H.

The difference between the AVI and SVI groups was synchrony, while the difference between the AVI and AVI-AI groups was the decision agent (human vs. AI). The 180 applicants were randomly allocated to one of three experimental groups, and the order was counterbalanced within each group as shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.2">Raters</head><p>A total of 6 real recruiters agreed to participate in the study as raters of the candidates.

The average age of the raters was 40 years, and they had 10 to 15 years of employment selection experience. The raters were compensated with a voucher equivalent to USD100 for their participation in this experiment. The six raters were randomly assigned by gender to rate the interview performance of 10 applicants in each experimental group; thus, each rater evaluated a total of 30 applicants from the AVI-AI, AVI and SVI settings. Each group had one male and one female rater, and each applicant had one rater.</p></div>

In the first stage, three HR professionals at a senior management level (of the 180 applicants and 6 raters) with employment selection experience in the AVI-AI, AVI and SVI settings were invited to participate in a pilot study to ensure that the study questionnaires and hypotheses were appropriate and significant.</p><p>The sponsor organization posted a web page that was accessible to its members and that contained a job description (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) for hiring 2-3 HR managers for its affiliated company located in Shenzhen, Guangdong, China. Interested members submitted their resumes to the researchers, and the researchers screened the resumes based on the job description. Then, a total of 180 qualified applicants received a brief explanation of the study procedure and signed a consent form via email. As promised, the organization referred 30 suitable candidates to the employer based on the applicants' interview performance. The employer invited appropriate candidates for formal face-to-face interviews at its discretion.</p><p>Prior to the onset of the experiment, the six raters attended a 2-hour frame-of-reference training session <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Roch, Woehr, Mishra, &amp; Kieszczynska, 2012)</ref> to review the experimental procedures and to learn how to operate the equipment for each interview setting. Before beginning the formal interviews, all of the applicants participated in one practice trial (time unlimited) using the media according to the online instructions.</p><p>To eliminate the impacts of resumes on interview ratings due to expectation bias (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Torres &amp; Gregory, 2018)</ref>, we did not disclose the applicants' resume information to the raters in this study. In the SVI and AVI settings, the raters were asked to evaluate their initial impression of each applicant and the applicant's physical appearance after the applicant answered the first interview question; the raters also provided an interview score for each answer. Upon completing the interviews, all applicants were asked to answer online questionnaires regarding their feelings of favourability and perceived fairness regarding their respective interview setting. </p></div>

All questions were behaviourally orientated to assess the applicants' communication skills based on the HRDA's (2018) structured interview questions, as shown in Table <ref type="table">2</ref>. This approach was adopted because communication skills can be easily analysed and compared by both asynchronous and synchronous video media (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Rasipuram et al., 2016)</ref> and because communication skills were essential to the job description (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</p><p>Table 2.

In the AVI settings, the raters watched the video recordings and rated the applicants' communication skills for each question. In the SVI setting, the raters evaluated the applicants' communication skills directly during the live video interview. A rating was made after the applicant finished answering each question, and each answer was evaluated using a 5-point rating scale, as shown in </p></div>

Therefore, prior to scoring the first interview answer for each applicant, each rater provided ratings of his or her initial impression of the applicant's suitability, which were used to examine H1 and H3. This measure consisted of four items rated on the 5-point scale (from 1 strongly disagree to 5 strongly agree) previously used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Swider et al.

The correlation matrix showed that applicants exhibited higher favourability towards the interview process when they received higher appearance ratings and had higher interview motivation (Mean=3.75; SD=0.89); therefore, it is possible that appearance rating and interview motivation slightly influenced perceived fairness. Furthermore, the applicants had greater numbers of video interview experiences (Mean=1.40; SD=1.12) in synchronous mode (SVI) than in asynchronous mode (AVI) or asynchronous mode plus AI-based decision agent (AVI-AI), and the applicants reported higher favourability towards the interview process in SVI than in AVI or AVI-AI.</p><p>Prior to testing the hypotheses, we used chi-square tests and ANOVAs to examine the differences in the control variables, including gender, age, education, interview motivation, and video interview experience among the three experimental groups.

This result indicated that applicant initial impression and applicant appearance rating had stronger effects on interview score in the SVI setting than in the AVI setting. This result suggests that synchrony may have moderated the influence of applicants' initial impression or appearance rating on interview score. To test whether synchrony (Z) moderated the relationship between initial impression (X1)</p><p>and interview score (Y1) or that between applicant appearance rating (X2) and interview score (Y2), we performed two linear regressions. X1, Z, and X1*Z or X2, Z, and X2*Z were included as the independent variables, education level was included as a control variable, and Y1 or Y2</p><p>was the dependent variable. A dummy independent variable was created for the SVI group (Z [2,1]), and an ordinal independent variable was used for education level (bachelor's [0]; master's</p><p>[1]; doctorate <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>). All the variables were standardized before running the regression models.</p><p>As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_13">7</ref>, education level was entered as a control variable in the two separate regression models, but it did not have a significant impact on interview score. The results of the first regression model for Model 1 indicated that interview scores could be predicted by initial impression ratings, and the applicants' average interview scores were better or worse in the SVI condition than in the AVI condition when their initial impression was better or worse, respectively. In other words, the applicants' initial impressions had a stronger effect on interview scores in the SVI condition than in the AVI condition. The results of Model 2 indicated that an applicant's interview score could be predicted by his or her appearance rating. However, there was no significant interaction effect of appearance rating and synchrony on interview score.</p><p>Therefore, H3 was fully supported, and H4 was partially supported. We used MANCOVAs to test H5 and H6. We examined whether synchrony (the independent/fixed variable) explained statistically significant amounts of the variances in applicant favourability towards the interview process and perceived fairness (dependent variables) while controlling for education level (a covariate). The results showed that synchrony significantly affected the dependent variables, F(2, 116) = 40.511, p&lt;.001, Wilks' λ= .589, while education level also impacted the dependent variables, F(2, 116) = 4.157, p&lt;.001, Wilks' λ= .933.</p><p>We found that synchrony had a statistically significant effect on applicant favourability towards the interview process [F(1, 117) = 75.259; p &lt; .001; ηp2 = .391] but not perceived fairness [F(1, 117) = .497; p = .482; ηp2 = .004]. Education level did not have a significant impact on either favourability towards the interview process (p = .067) or perceived fairness (p = .219). These findings suggested that the applicants perceived SVIs more favourably than AVIs. However, the applicants' perception of procedural fairness did not differ between the SVI and AVI conditions.</p><p>Therefore, H5 was supported, but H6 was not.</p><p>To test H7, a one-way ANCOVA was used to compare the means for perceived fairness between the AVI (3.454) and AVI-AI (3.515) conditions with the inclusion of education level as a covariate. The results showed that the decision agent (human vs. AI) did not have a significant effect on perceived fairness [F(1, 117) = .276; p = .600; ηp2 = .002] and that education level did not have a significant effect on perceived fairness [F(1, 117) = .104; p = .748; ηp2 = .001]. The results indicated that the applicants did not perceive differences in procedural fairness between the AVI and AVI-AI conditions. In other words, the AI decision agent used in the AVI setting did not influence perceived fairness. Therefore, H7 was not supported.</p></div>

Although the advantages of AVIs are clear (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Torres &amp; Gregory, 2018)</ref>, the unintended social impacts caused by asynchrony and the use of AI-based decision agents in AVIs have not been addressed to the best of our knowledge. This study employed an experimental design to examine the effects of synchrony and decision agent by comparing interview ratings and applicant attitudes between the SVI and AVI settings and comparing applicants' perceptions of fairness between the AVI and AVI-AI settings.</p><p>Regarding interview ratings, this study proved that despite the use of a structured behavioural interview setting, a candidate's first impression and physical appearance are advantageous for human ratings regardless of whether video interviews are synchronous or asynchronous (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Swider et al., 2016)</ref>. In addition, in synchronous interviews, the impacts of initial impression and physical appearance rating on interview score are greater when their values are more extreme (either positive or negative). Thus, compared with the synchronous mode, the asynchronous mode can decrease the impressional primacy effect when evaluating a candidate's competencies via video interview.</p><p>Regarding applicant perceptions, the applicants reported less favourability towards asynchronous interviews, consistent with <ref type="bibr">Langer et al.'s (2017)</ref> findings. Compared to synchronous interview modes that involve human interviewers, asynchronous-based interviews are disliked by many applicants because the applicants must answer questions and watch themselves answering during non-human interactions (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Langer et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p>In contrast to <ref type="bibr">Langer et al.'s (2017)</ref> findings, perceived procedural justice was not found to be lower for AVI settings than for SVI settings or for AVI-AI settings than for AVI settings.</p><p>One possible explanation may be that the applicants' fairness perceptions reflected computersare-social-actors theory (CASA; <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Nass &amp; Moon, 2000)</ref>, in which applicants perceive computers to be as trustworthy as humans; therefore, neither synchrony nor the AI decision agent was sufficiently salient to influence the applicants' perceptions of procedural justice (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Ötting &amp; Maier, 2018)</ref>. Another possibility may be that perceived procedural justice in the current study was evoked by different interview questions or through the use of different items to capture procedural justice.</p><p>Taken together, the results of our study have several implications for practitioners: 1)</p><p>Since the validity of a video interview can be impaired by the interviewer's initial impression of the applicant <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Swider et al., 2016)</ref>, asynchronous-based interviewing can be used to decrease the impressional primacy effect and bias, which significantly influences selection decisions by interviewers <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Florea et al., 2019)</ref>. 2) Automatic asynchronous video interviews plus AI decision agent may avoid the procedural justice issue, and this interview modality should be considered as a potential alternative to synchronous-based interviews conducted by human interviewers, which entail higher costs and greater restriction regarding scheduling <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Torres &amp; Gregory, 2018)</ref>. 3)</p><p>Although there is no justice concern, employers or recruiters should be aware of the disadvantages of using asynchronous interview platforms due to the lower level of human interaction, which may cause withdrawal behaviours in applicants (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Langer et al., 2017)</ref>. 4) As AVIs using AI decision agents are being adopted by an increasing number of organizations, industrial educators or institutes should carefully consider user training for both interviewees and interviewers in this new context.</p><p>This study also offers contributions to research: 1) While most of the video interviewing research over the years has adopted a research survey perspective (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Haan et al., 2017)</ref>, this study extended and combined media richness theory and social interface theory to explore the impacts of different features of video interviews-synchrony and AI decision agent-on employment selection. 2) To respond to the research need for clarifying how new technologies affect user reactions (McCarthy et al., 2017), this study employed a novel experimental design to compare how both applicants' and raters' reactions are affected by whether video interviews are Suen, H.

However, our results do not indicate that synchrony influenced the applicants' perception of fairness. Additionally, our participants did not respond differently in terms of fairness perception to the AVI-AI and AVI settings, even though they were told that the AVI-AI would involve an evaluation of their verbal and nonverbal cues during the interview in addition to the criteria that are generally evaluated by human interviewers <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Nguyen, Frauendorfer, Mast, &amp; Gatica-Perez, 2014)</ref>. Future research on social computing or humancomputer interaction could examine other applicant or rater behaviours that are affected by AI interventions.</p><p>Some limitations of this study should be noted. 1) To conduct authentic video interviews, we adopted an HR job posting from a specific company, which might have screened out some types of applicants through self-selection for person-organization fit <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Chapman, Uggerslev, Carroll, Piasentin, &amp; Jones, 2005)</ref>, thus possibly introducing sample selection bias. 2) To control for possible race effects (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Finkelstein et al., 2007</ref>) and to answer the call for more international research, this study exclusively involved Chinese respondents, but this approach limits the generalizability of the study results to other culture contexts. Future research could expand to more populations in different countries. 3) To eliminate contamination due to resumes in this experiment (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Torres &amp; Gregory, 2018)</ref>, we did not allow the raters to review the applicants' resumes before the interviews.
