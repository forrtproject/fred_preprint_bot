			<abstract>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Objective: Blended Care (BC), the integration of Internet-based interventions into psychotherapy (PT), is thought of as a promising approach to enhance PT's effectiveness and efficiency. This randomized controlled trial aimed to investigate the usage, implementation, and effectiveness of BC with transdiagnostic online modules compared to PT in routine care.</p><p>Method: Psychotherapists in routine care recruited 1159 patients who were randomized to BC or PT. Outcomes included self-reported anxiety, depression, satisfaction with life and level of functioning, as well as therapist-rated severity and changes. Outcomes were measured at baseline, 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and 6 months. We examined whether BC and PT groups changed differently over time using linear mixed models. We also investigated differences in sessions and terminations and report usage metrics of the BC platform.</p><p>Results: Contrary to our hypotheses, we did not find differences between BC and PT in outcomes, including anxiety, depression, satisfaction with life, level of functioning, therapistrated severity / changes, and satisfaction with treatment at 6-months post-randomization (all p &gt; 0.05). BC and PT did not differ in the number of sessions or terminations. Regarding usage of the BC platform, 534 patients (91.6%) received at least one online chapter, with M = 7.26 (SD = 7.01) online chapters assigned on average.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions:</head><p>In real-world applications of BC, therapists have considerable flexibility in integrating IBIs with sessions. Our findings suggest that the benefits observed in more controlled BC settings may not fully translate to routine care, possibly due to variations in implementation and adherence to BC.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Increasing the Effectiveness of Psychotherapy in Routine Care through Transdiagnostic</head><p>Online Modules? Randomized Controlled Trial Investigating Blended Care Mental disorders are highly prevalent, with comorbidity being the rule rather than the exception <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Jacobi et al., 2014)</ref>. Mental disorders significantly impact the quality of life, social functioning, and even physical health <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Arias et al., 2022)</ref>. At the same time, less than 25% of patients with a mental disorder seek professional help <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Heinig et al., 2021)</ref>. For those who do, the average waiting time to start PT in German outpatient care is approximately five months, due to the current demand for PT exceeding available treatment capacities <ref type="bibr">(Bundespsychotherapeutenkammer, 2011)</ref>. Integrating Internet-based interventions (IBI) into routine psychotherapeutic treatment ("BC") has the potential to alleviate the strain on the mental healthcare system. By IBIs assuming some treatment responsibilities, such as providing psychoeducation, interactive therapeutic exercises, and symptom monitoring, IBIs may free up psychotherapeutic resources and expand the reach of mental health support. While the evidence for the efficacy of standalone IBI is relatively sound, BC as a research field is only emerging. A first systematic review found that BC may boost the effects of PT and increase cost-effectiveness and adherence rates <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Erbe et al., 2017)</ref>. Given the heterogeneous possibilities of blending IBIs and PT and the dynamic research activity on BC in recent years, it is worthwhile to nuance these findings with more recent empirical evidence. The vast majority of studies have investigated BC with a disorder-specific focus in the context of depression. Studies investigating the additional benefit of using an IBI as an add-on to traditional PT without integrating the IBI into the sessions show small to medium between-group effects in favor of BC <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Berger et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Schuster et al., 2020)</ref>. More integrated BC setups with a higher degree of blend between face-to-face therapy and IBIs show comparable effects between BC and PT <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Kemmeren et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Kooistra et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Mathiasen et al., 2022)</ref>. Most frequently, the BC setup is manualized and involves alternating sessions between patients working on the IBI by themselves and a therapy session with a psychotherapist. The comparable effectiveness suggests that integrating IBIs into therapy can optimize mental health care delivery, offering individuals the same level of therapeutic benefits, often with fewer sessions. A recent pilot study in depressed patients investigated an integrated, modular BC setup to PT with an equal number of PT sessions between both groups and found indications that BC may be superior in reducing symptoms of depression and anxiety with small effects, albeit the study was underpowered <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Kalde et al., 2023)</ref>. Another recent study in a transdiagnostic sample of outpatients indicated that an emotion regulation-focused IBI added to PT shows comparable effects to PT alone <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bielinski et al., 2023)</ref>.</p><p>Outside of study contexts, the uptake of BC in routine care is still limited, which may be overcome by adapting the intervention to routine care: For one, by involving patients and therapists in the development and implementation process, and secondly, by enabling psychotherapists to flexibly use the online materials and tailor the blended treatment to each patient's specific needs <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Titzler et al., 2018)</ref>. For Germany specifically, it may also require the BC intervention to be applicable for different therapeutic approaches beyond CBT, as a large proportion of psychotherapists in routine care are not CBT-based. To address these implementation barriers, we developed a transdiagnostic, transtheoretical, and modular BC intervention called TONI that addresses shared mechanisms and symptoms across the whole spectrum of mental health and applies a common language of PT <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Behr et al., 2024)</ref>.</p><p>This study aimed to investigate the usage, implementation, and effectiveness of BC with TONI compared to regular face-to-face PT in routine care in Germany. We expected BC with TONI to be superior in alleviating anxiety and depression to routine PT with a small effect.</p><p>Beyond that, we analyzed the differences between BC and PT in secondary outcomes, including level of functioning, satisfaction with life, number of sessions, and therapist-rated symptom distress and changes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method Trial Design</head><p>In a parallel-group, two-arm randomized controlled superiority trial conducted in routine care in Germany, this study aims to assess the comparative effectiveness of BC to PT. We reported the study procedure in detail in the study protocol <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Schaeuffele et al., 2022)</ref> The study was preregistered (DRKS00028536) and approved by the ethics committee of Psychologische Hochschule Berlin (EK202121).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure and Participants</head><p>All psychotherapists, irrespective of psychotherapeutic approach, participating in routine PT within the public health insurance system in Germany with internet access in their practice were eligible to participate. Psychotherapists enrolled their patients into the trial according to these inclusion criteria: Patients were over 18 years old, had internet access, had sufficient German language skills, and were able to read and write. There were no exclusion criteria based on diagnoses or symptom severity due to the naturalistic nature of the trial. Patients needed to be enrolled during the initial consultation sessions with a therapist that are used to establish diagnosis and rapport before applying for coverage through their public health insurance.</p><p>Patients and therapists provided electronic informed consent before participating.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Randomization</head><p>We implemented randomization at the patient level and thus chose block randomization to ensure that psychotherapists treat patients of both groups. After patients provided their consent and baseline data, the TONI platform automatically randomly allocated patients to either BC or routine PT in a 1:1 ratio applying a pre-specified, concealed randomization algorithm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Interventions</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Routine PT</head><p>All patients received routine PT. Psychotherapists were either psychologists or physicians who underwent post-graduate training in PT and had a license to practice as psychotherapists.</p><p>Psychotherapists could be licensed in CBT, psychodynamic (including psychoanalysis), systemic therapy, or a combination. Routine PT comprises heterogeneous treatment lengths and procedures. Due to the naturalistic nature of this trial, additional (mental) healthcare utilization was not limited.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>BC (Routine PT and TONI)</head><p>In the BC group, psychotherapists could use TONI in addition to routine PT. TONI is a comprehensive digital toolkit that includes twelve transdiagnostic and transtheoretical modules (see Table <ref type="table">1</ref>), as well as a range of self-monitoring tools. Psychotherapists could individualize BC by selecting and ordering specific modules or chapters and by implementing TONI flexibly into the therapy process. Due to the naturalistic structure of the trial, we did not instruct psychotherapists to apply a specific implementation of TONI, i.e., they could choose the frequency, duration, and format of TONI. In addition, patients could request access to modules.</p><p>To allow for a high blend of sessions and the IBI, psychotherapists were able to view patients' entries in the modules' record forms. Patients were free to share additional TONI components, like symptom monitoring. Psychotherapists could enable messaging to allow for written communication with their patients through the platform.</p><p>Table 1.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Outcomes</head><p>All outcomes were assessed at baseline, 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and 6 months post-randomization, unless otherwise specified.</p><p>Primary outcome. The primary outcome was self-reported anxiety and depression, assessed with the GAD-7 and PHQ-8. The Patient Health Questionnaire-8 (PHQ-8) is an eightitem tool for depressive symptoms <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Gräfe et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Kroenke et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Kroenke &amp; Spitzer, 2002)</ref> that omits the suicidal ideation item from the PHQ-9. Participants rate their emotional well-being over the past two weeks on a 4-point scale (0 = "not at all" to 3 = "nearly every day").</p><p>Scores range from 0 to 24, with higher scores indicating more severe depression. The PHQ-8 is internally reliable (α = .88) and valid in clinical and non-clinical settings <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Wu et al., 2020)</ref>. The Generalized Anxiety Disorder Screener (GAD-7) is a seven-item measure of general anxiety <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Löwe et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Spitzer et al., 2006)</ref>. Participants rate anxiety symptoms over the past two weeks on a 4-point scale (0 = "not at all" to 3 = "nearly every day"). The GAD-7 is unidimensional and internally reliable (α = .89).</p><p>Secondary outcome. Secondary self-reported outcomes included satisfaction with life (SWLS) and level of functioning (AQoL-8D). The Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS) measures overall life satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Diener et al., 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Glaesmer et al., 2011)</ref>. Participants rate five items on a 7-point Likert scale (1 = "strongly disagree" to 7 = "strongly agree"). Scores range from 5 to 35, with higher scores indicating greater satisfaction. The SWLS is internally reliable (α = .92; <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Glaesmer et al., 2011)</ref>). The Assessment of Quality of Life (AQoL-8D) is a 35-item instrument assessing overall quality of life <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Richardson et al., 2014)</ref> . It covers eight domains: independent living, pain, senses, mental health, happiness, coping, relationships, and self-worth. The AQoL-8D is internally reliable (α = .80; <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Richardson et al., 2014)</ref>). We also measured satisfaction with treatment at 6-months post-treatment with an adaptation of the CSQ <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Attkisson &amp; Zwick, 1982;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Schmidt et al., 1989)</ref>. Comprising eight items, it measures various aspects of patient contentment, such as overall satisfaction, perceived benefits, and willingness to recommend the treatment to others. The CSQ has demonstrated good reliability (α = .92).</p><p>Therapist ratings. Therapists rated symptom distress with the Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI). The CGI evaluates illness severity and improvement over time <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Berk et al., 2008)</ref>. It includes two components: CGI-S rates current severity on a seven-point scale from "normal" to "among the most extremely ill patients." CGI-I rates improvement or deterioration from "very much improved" to "very much worse." and was accordingly not measured at baseline. Both scales are reliable (α = .71; <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Berk et al., 2008)</ref>). Therapists also provided information on the number of sessions at 6-months. Since TONI was intended for use during active PT, they were also asked to indicate on the platform or during the 6-month assessment whether therapy had concluded. If so, they were prompted to indicate whether the PT ended prematurely and who initiated the termination.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample size</head><p>We hypothesized that BC would be superior to routine PT, with an incremental effect of d = 0.2. 400 patients per group are needed to detect this effect at 6-months post-randomization in an RCT with a t-test and alpha set to 0.05 (two-sided). The nesting of patients in therapists was taken into account by considering therapists' effects: An assumed average caseload of 5 new patients per year and an intraclass correlation of 0.05 <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Schiefele et al., 2017)</ref> result in a design effect of 1.2 [design effect = 1 + (nC -1) × ICC = 1 + (5 -1) × 0.05 = 1.20 ]. In addition, a dropout rate of 20% was assumed. This results in a sample size of at least (400 × design effect × missing values = 400 × 1.2 × 1.2) 1152 patients (~ 231 psychotherapists) to detect the assumed effect of d = 0.2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical Analyses</head><p>All analyses were performed using R 4.4.1 (R Core Team, 2013). For the primary analyses, we included data from all randomized patients (intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis) and conducted the analyses blindly with respect to the intervention group label. Analyses on the usage of TONI were conducted separately once the main analyses were completed. The data, analysis procedure, and code for all analyses is provided on OSF <ref type="url" target="https://osf.io/5cn37/?view_only=c6e736a45cb14ea7ba0b99b466e15d70">https://osf.io/5cn37/?view_only=c6e736a45cb14ea7ba0b99b466e15d70</ref> [note: this is a viewonly link created for peer-review; we will make the project publicly available on OSF and provide the doi upon acceptance of this manuscript].</p><p>Before analyzing the data, we multiply imputed the missing values of the primary and secondary outcomes using predictive mean matching in the mice package for R (van Buuren &amp; Groothuis-Oudshoorn, 2011). In the performed imputation, the multilevel structure of the data was taken into account with the patient ID as the cluster variable. The variables used for the imputation can be divided into two main groups. The first group consists of questionnaires measuring clinically relevant variables. The full overview of the battery is available at the OSF.</p><p>We used patients' questionnaire data for imputation, with the exception of the WAI-SR questionnaire, where therapists' data was used. Regarding the item-level data imputation, we used item-level data to impute other items from the same scale or subscale, but only scale-or subscale-level data to impute items from other scales or subscales to avoid collinearity issues.</p><p>Regarding the scale-or subscale-level data imputation, scale and subscale scores were passively imputed. The second group of variables used for imputation consists of certain demographic and medical characteristics of the patients and of study-related variables: patient age, gender, location, socioeconomic status, employment status, relationship status, education, distance, preferred and applied PT method, existence of previous diseases, family history of diseases, medication, therapy termination, whether the patient experiences discrimination and whether they attended therapy. The variables were chosen on a theoretical basis, with the exception of diseases, for which we found significant correlation with the outcomes. We imputed 30 values for each missing value. We used predictive mean matching as the imputation method, both for the time point-and patient-level variables. The imputation procedure converged normally with 𝑅 " &lt; 1.1. Imputation was performed using Freie Universität Berlin's High Performance Cluster <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bennett et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Although we randomized patients to intervention groups, we tested for group differences in all baseline variables. Variables with group differences of at least a small effect size were controlled for in the subsequent analyses. For evaluating the effectiveness of blended versus routine PT, we first conducted linear multilevel regression using the lme4 package <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bates et al., 2014)</ref>. We conducted a separate analysis for every primary and secondary outcome. The predictors included in the multilevel models were timepoint, study group and their interaction.</p><p>We also included education level as a covariate, as we found group differences in this variable between the two study groups. We fitted a random intercept model with a random intercept for every patient. We assessed assumptions of the multilevel models by checking diagnostic plots of residuals versus fitted values, distribution of the residuals, and the distribution of the random intercepts. No significant deviations from the model assumptions was detected. The plots pertaining to the assumption tests can be found in the supplementary materials. The results were pooled across imputations. Secondly, we calculated the proportion of patients who achieved reliable change based on the data. Reliable change was determined based on PHQ-8 (change of six points or more) and GAD-7 scores (change of four points or more) <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Porter et al., 2024)</ref>. For the significance tests, we applied the multivariate t-distribution correction <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Kotz &amp; Nadarajah, 2004)</ref>.</p></div>

Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> shows baseline characteristics for patients randomized to BC vs. PT. Participants were mostly female, in their mid-thirties, in a relationship, educated, and employed. A total of 39.54% lived in a rural area, and 32.01% were on medication. Additionally, 42.02% reported at least one health issue, and 47.89% had undergone PT in the past. The most common diagnoses were affective, anxiety, and adjustment disorders, with half of the sample having at least one comorbid diagnosis. There were significant differences with at least small effect size between BC and routine PT regarding education, which we subsequently controlled for in statistical analyses (see Table <ref type="table">5</ref>). There were no considerable or significant differences in baseline values of the outcomes between the two groups (Table <ref type="table">4</ref> and 5). Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> depicts therapist characteristics. Most therapists were licensed in CBT (82.68%), followed by psychodynamic therapy (19.55%). On average, therapists included M = 6.23 patients (SD = 4.60; range: 1-32).   </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>This study investigated the effects of BC in a naturalistic setting and compared its effects to routine PT. Contrary to our hypotheses, we did not find differences between BC and PT in outcomes, including anxiety, depression, satisfaction with life, level of functioning, therapistrated severity / changes and satisfaction with treatment. We also did not find a reduced number of therapeutic sessions or differences in therapy termination.</p><p>We hypothesized that integrating TONI, a transdiagnostic and transtheoretical modular digital intervention, would enhance the effects of PT in routine outpatient care. This assumption was grounded on (1) initial evidence suggesting that BC can improve PT effectiveness, as indicated by the first systematic review on the topic <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Erbe et al., 2017)</ref>, (2) the ability for therapists to outsource certain materials, such as psychoeducation, to TONI while adapting faceto-face sessions flexibly to patient needs, (3) the potentially higher therapy dosage and (4) the empowerment patients may receive by working on additional digital material between sessions.</p><p>Our findings are in line with more recent studies on BC for depression and anxiety, suggesting comparable clinical effects between BC and PT <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bielinski et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Kemmeren et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Kooistra et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Mathiasen et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Nakao et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Romijn et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>Studies indicating small to moderate between-group effect sizes in favor of BC, offered the online component as an adjunctive tool to usual care rather than an integrated blended treatment protocol <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Berger et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Schuster et al., 2020)</ref>. While integrated BC setups usually involve alternating sessions with online components and thus reduce the number of sessions while maintaining effectiveness <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Kemmeren et al., 2023)</ref>, we did not find any indication that BC reduces the number of sessions. In routine care in Germany, therapists have little incentive to reduce the number of sessions, as their compensation is session-based. They thus might not have implemented BC to the full extent, resulting in a very comparable dosage of treatment across both study groups.</p><p>With TONI, we encouraged a personalized and flexible use of online modules. Usage data showed that the first three modules (Values &amp; Goals, Development, Mindfulness) were assigned most often. This could reflect a particularly good fit for this content and the digital format as well as a broad applicability across patients and therapeutic schools <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Behr et al., 2024)</ref>.</p><p>It could, however, also reflect an inability or reluctance of psychotherapists to make individual choices for their patients, with the first three modules being a safe and convenient choice for all of their patients. In BC, as an emerging field, nearly all therapists are novices with no to very limited experience in how to integrate digital tools in their PT. Psychotherapists repeatedly identified this lack of knowledge and confidence as a barrier to implementing BC in qualitative studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Dech et al., 2022)</ref>. Their high caseload and the limited scope of the study (on average, therapists enrolled six patients in the study which were then randomized to the two groups) may also discourage transformative changes to their practice. The limited research on BC seems to show more robust results for additive designs, where the online material works independently of the face-to-face therapists, compared to integrative designs. While qualification and confidence in using digital tools will likely increase in the future, it still seems plausible that not all therapists want to actively engage with online materials. Future studies should investigate additive vs. integrative BC setups. Future studies may also focus on investigating the rationale and motivation of therapists to include online material in their therapy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Strengths and Limitations</head><p>We developed and tested a flexible, modular, and transtheoretical BC tool that allows psychotherapists of all orientations to integrate digital components across the whole spectrum of mental health. Main strengths of the trial are the naturalistic setting as well as the transdiagnostic application and evaluation. As such it offers evidence for implementation in practice for a broad clientele. Other strengths include the trial's sufficient power to detect small differences, statistical analyses based on masked data, the use of self-as well as therapist-rated measures, and the open science principles adopted, including sharing data and code. The integration of all therapeutic orientations as well as all diagnoses mirrors routine practice and increases external validity. However, there are still limitations to the generalizability of our findings: Despite extensive efforts to recruit therapists from diverse orientations, most therapists were CBT therapists. The largest proportion of patients was diagnosed by their therapist with an affective disorder, followed by anxiety and adjustment disorders. The study team did not conduct additional clinical interviews to corroborate diagnoses, and the diagnostic status at 6-month randomization is unknown. Psychotherapists were responsible for recruiting their patients, which might have constrained the scope of patient recruitment. While qualitative interviews with psychotherapists in our study indicated that they did not restrict patient inclusion into the trial <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Jordan et al., 2024)</ref> this approach may still limit generalizability. Randomization to treatment allowed for a causal interpretation of the results. We found some small imbalances between groups in baseline demographic variables, which we accounted for by subsequently controlling for these variables in the analyses. To deal with systematic dropout, we collected a large number of possible variables that may explain the missing data mechanism and controlled for it via multiple imputation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>BC holds the potential to increase therapy effectiveness and reduce therapist burden. Our findings suggest that the benefits observed in more controlled BC settings may not fully translate to routine care, potentially due to variations in implementation and adherence.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.

There was no significant group difference in the number of sessions (t(914.29) = 0.57, p = 0.566). For 25.26% (n = 147) patients in BC and 26.22% (n = 151) patients in PT, therapists indicated that treatment was terminated during the six-month study period. In BC, for 67.35 % (n = 99) patients it ended earlier than planned and for 32.65% (n = 48) it was terminated as planned. In conventional PT, it ended earlier than planned for 59.60 % (n = 90) of patients and for 40.40 % (n = 61) it ended as planned. There was no significant difference in termination rates between study groups (χ²(1) = 1.61, p = 0.205). Treatment satisfaction was high in both groups, with a mean CSQ score (maximum of 32 points) of 27.2 (SD = 3.98) in BC and 26.9 (SD = 4.38) in routine PT.
