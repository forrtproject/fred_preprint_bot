<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This study investigates the behavioral and neural correlates of implicit and automatic gender stereotyping at the intersection of language and face processing, focusing on the bidirectional flow of gender-stereotypical information and previously observed asymmetries in stereotype processing. We recorded response times (RTs) and Event-Related Potentials (ERPs) to a target face (male, female) preceded by stereotypically associated words (e.g., conducente "driver", badante "caregiver"), or to stereotypically associated target words preceded by a face (male, female). Participants performed a gender categorization task on target faces and a lexical decision task on target words/non-words. RTs showed typical priming effects for target faces, but an asymmetrical priming effect for target words: faster responses to stereotypically female words preceded by a gender-congruent face, whereas faster responses to stereotypically male words preceded by a gender-incongruent face. ERPs showed a gender stereotype asymmetry for target faces and only partially for target words. Female faces elicited a larger P300 and LPP when preceded by stereotypically gender-incongruent than -congruent prime words; male faces elicited a larger N400 when preceded by stereotypically gender-incongruent than -congruent prime words. Similarly, stereotypically male words elicited a larger P300 when preceded by a genderincongruent than congruent face. Our findings reveal robust neural asymmetries in gender stereotype processing, extending beyond language, underscoring the need to treat female-and male-related biases as distinct cognitive phenomena in both future research and intervention.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Are women in male roles perceived the same as men in female roles? Growing neural evidence suggests asymmetrical processing of gender stereotypes. Studies employing event-related potentials (ERPs) to investigate the electrophysiological correlates of language-based gender stereotyping, have revealed distinct neural responses to violations of male and female stereotypes. The violation of femalerelated stereotypes by male agents elicited an N400 incongruence effect <ref type="bibr">(Proverbio et al., 2018 in men;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Siyanova-Chanturia et al., 2012</ref>; but see <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Weinstein et al., 2025</ref> for a congruency effect), whereas the violation of male-related stereotypes by female agents elicited a P600 effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Irmen et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Proverbio et al., 2018 in men;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Su et al., 2016)</ref>. Studies that reported no asymmetry may have conflated male-and female-related stereotypes, highlighting the need to examine them as distinct phenomena.</p><p>This pattern suggests that male-and female-related stereotypes engage different cognitive mechanisms occurring at different timing. The N400 effect -a centro-parietal negative-going deflection occurring around 400 ms-could index the difficulty of accessing or retrieving the meaning of single words, or of integrating the meaning of a word in sentence contexts <ref type="bibr">(Hagoort et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Kutas et al., 2006)</ref>. The P600, and related late positivities (e.g., P300, LPP), could index integration difficulties requiring a reanalysis and repair <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Niharika &amp; Prema Rao, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Osterhout &amp; Holcomb, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">1995)</ref> and context updating <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Donchin, 1981)</ref>. Stereotype asymmetries may arise from the unmarked, generic use of the male gender (e.g., uomo "man," referring to both men and women), or from the unequal pace at which men and women have entered-or sought to enter-gender-atypical roles. While women are increasingly taking on roles traditionally held by men <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Diekman &amp; Eagly, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr">World Bank, 2023)</ref>, men rarely access roles traditionally held by women <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(England, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Goldin, 2006)</ref>.</p><p>Our recent study <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Serafini &amp; Pesciarelli, 2025</ref>) demonstrated this neural asymmetry in face processing, thereby extending prior findings beyond language. Faces are far more salient and socially relevant than words, they convey gender cues rapidly ( ͂ 200 ms e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Ito &amp; Urland, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Mouchetant-Rostaing et al., 2000)</ref> and can automatically activate stereotypes <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Ito &amp; Tomelleri, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Volpert-Esmond et al., 2017)</ref>. In addition, pictures access semantic meaning more directly than words, and social category activation is thought to be stronger through person perception <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Macrae &amp; Bodenhausen, 2000)</ref>. These properties make them ecological and suitable for the investigation of automatic and implicit stereotyping. In our study, we recorded ERPs as Italian-speaking participants categorized by gender feminine and masculine Italian third-person singular pronouns (i.e., lui "he", lei "she"), and female and male faces, primed by stereotypically associated or grammatically marked female or male words. We found a gender asymmetry for the processing of faces primed by gender stereotypical words, consistent with the previously reported one: the priming effect was on the N400 for violations of the female stereotype by male faces (e.g., badante "caregiver" -male face), whereas on the P300/LPP for violations of the male stereotype by female faces (e.g., falegname "carpenter"-female face). We did not find the typical ERP priming effects for pronouns, suggesting stronger stereotyping for faces than words (for a detailed explanation see <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Serafini &amp; Pesciarelli, 2025)</ref>.</p><p>The present study aimed to (i) replicate this face-related asymmetry and (ii) examine the reverse priming direction: stereotypically associated words primed by gender-conveying faces. The dynamic interactive theory of person construal <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Freeman &amp; Ambady, 2011)</ref> allows for stereotype activation to affect category activation (e.g., gender), so that our previous findings could be ascribed to the top-down influence of activated gender stereotypes on perception. However, traditional models <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Brewer, 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Fiske &amp; Neuberg, 1990)</ref> view stereotype activation as a bottom-up process, from member perception to stereotype activation: perceiving a woman would automatically activate the female stereotype, so that stereotypic traits (e.g., "housewife," "caregiver") can become highly accessible. Presenting a face followed by a stereotypically associated word allows us to test this pathway by examining how the brain responds to violations in the attribution of gender-stereotyped information to members of stereotyped groups.</p><p>In ERP language research, the order in which gender-related and stereotypical information is presented appears to influence sentence processing but not priming effects. In sentence comprehension studies, the N400 effect typically emerges when counter-stereotypical information must be integrated within a pre-activated gender category (e.g., "Li's son is a nurse") <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Kreiner et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Molinaro et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Weinstein et al., 2025;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Du &amp; Zhang, 2023)</ref>, whereas the P600 effect when stereotypical information inform gender inferences, such as during anaphoric resolution (e.g., "the doctor prepared herself for the operation") <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Canal et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Kreiner et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Irmen et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Osterhout et al., 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Su et al., 2016)</ref>. Exceptions to this pattern are the findings by <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Weinstein et al. (2025)</ref> who contrarily reported an LPP effect when stereotypically associated words followed gender-conveying words, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Proverbio et al. (2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">2018)</ref>, in which the critical word was not fixed, but could be either the gender-revealing or the stereotype-conveying word. Gender stereotype asymmetries have been reported for both orders on the N400 <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Grant et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Proverbio et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Weinstein et al., 2025)</ref> and P600 <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Irmen et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Su et al., 2016</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">, Proverbio et al., 2018)</ref>. Notably, to our knowledge, only one sentence processing study <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Kreiner et al., 2009)</ref> directly compared both presentation orders within the same experiment, consistently finding a P600 when gender had to be inferred from the stereotypically associated word (e.g., "The minister left London after reminding herself about the letter"), and an early negativity in the N400 time window when it did not ("After reminding herself about the letter, the minister left London").</p><p>In contrast, priming paradigms with word pairs tend to elicit N400 effects for gender stereotype violations regardless of the direction of the priming, whether gender-conveying words follow stereotypically associated words (e.g., Driver -She) <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Pesciarelli et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Siyanova-Chanturia et al., 2012)</ref>, or stereotypically associated words followed gender-conveying words (e.g., Men-Nurturing) <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Wang et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">White et al., 2009)</ref>. Asymmetries have been so far reported only in the former case <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Siyanova-Chanturia et al., 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Critically, no ERP study to date has directly compared both presentation orders within the same priming experiment in the context of gender stereotype processing. In our recent study combining words and faces within a priming paradigm <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Serafini &amp; Pesciarelli, 2025)</ref>, we observed more complex ERP effects, including a P300/LPP effect, suggesting that priming effects may be more nuanced than previously assumed. The greater complexity could be due to the use of faces or to the separate analysis of female and male targets. Faces have been shown to elicit both N400-and P300-like effects when preceded by stereotypical verbal or visual information <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Rodríguez-Gómez et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Sato et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Serafini &amp; Pesciarelli, 2025)</ref> and an N400-like when they prime stereotypical targets <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Zhang et al., 2018)</ref>, although asymmetries have only been reported when faces follow stereotype-conveying stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Rodríguez-Gómez et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Serafini &amp; Pesciarelli, 2025)</ref>.</p><p>The present study presents a replicated condition <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Serafini and Pesciarelli, 2025)</ref> and a novel condition. In the replicated condition, face targets (male, female) were preceded by stereotypical words (e.g., conducente "driver", badante "caregiver"). In the novel condition, the order was reversed: stereotypical word targets were preceded by faces. Italian speaking participants performed a gender categorization task on target faces, and a lexical decision task on target words/non-words. This design allows us to directly compare ERP effects across both presentation orders and examine whether the observed asymmetries and late positive effects are maintained when the sequence of information is inverted. These tasks focus on implicit processing without explicitly referencing gender-stereotype associations. We expected to replicate the face-related asymmetry: an N400 effect for violations of female stereotypes by male faces, and an P300/LPP effect for violations of male stereotypes by female faces. For word targets, we predicted the inverse pattern: an N400 effect when expectations of malerelated information were violated by female-stereotypical words, and a P300/LPP effect when expectations of female-related information were violated by male-stereotypical words. This prediction is based on the reported inverted stereotypical asymmetries found when stereotypical information needed to be integrated into a preactivated gender category <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Weinstein et al., 2025)</ref>. The effects might be stronger for words due to a more ecological priming order, or stronger for faces due to greater use of stereotypical information when gender can be inferred, or to the more implicit nature of the lexical decision task <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(White et al., 2018)</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Participants</head><p>Thirty-eight native Italian speakers participated in the experiment (20 women<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">foot_0</ref> , age range = 18 -43 yrs, M = 21.29 yrs, SD = 4.37 yrs). Participants were undergraduate students from the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Italy, and researchers' acquaintances. Five female participants were excluded from all analyses due to low accuracy (&lt; 90% overall in the face or word condition). The final sample consisted of 33 participants (15 women, two ambidextrous, age range = 18 -43 yrs, M = 21.67 yrs, SD = 4.57 yrs). All participants had normal or corrected-to-normal vision, but one color blind, and they declared no history of neurological disorders. The final sample coincided with the sample size of our previous study <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Serafini &amp; Pesciarelli, 2025)</ref> and is in line with previous literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Siyanova-Chanturia et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Pesciarelli et al., 2019)</ref>.</p><p>The experiment was approved by the local Ethical Committee (Comitato Etico dell'Area Vasta Emilia Nord-Italy) and it was run in accordance with the "Italian Association of Psychology" (AIP) Ethical Guidelines (Codice Etico: <ref type="url" target="www.aipass.org/node/11560">www.aipass.org/node/11560</ref>) and the Declaration of Helsinki. Participants provided written informed consent prior to participation, and university students received course credits.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Stimuli</head><p>Word stimuli were the same used in our previous works <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Siyanova-Chanturia et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Pesciarelli et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Serafini &amp; Pesciarelli, 2025)</ref>. They consisted of 90 Italian bi-gender words conveying occupation, individual characteristics, or roles. Thirty were stereotypically female and 30 stereotypically male words (e.g., insegnante "teacher", conducente "driver", respectively); 30 were stereotypically neutral words, serving as fillers (e.g., conoscente "acquaintance"). Stereotypically female and male words received equally high evaluations of gender-oriented stereotypicality (see details in <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Siyanova-Chanturia et al., 2012)</ref>. Fillers served to prevent participants from noticing the presence of the gender stereotypical words. All words ended either with -e or consonant, to avoid a gender-to-ending consistency typical of the Italian language (-a ending being typically feminine, -o ending being typically masculine). Ninety non-word stimuli were generated from gender-marked words previously rated as stereotypically neutral (see <ref type="bibr">Siyanova-Chanturia et al., 2012 for details)</ref>. For words shorter than seven letters, one letter was replaced; for words longer than eight letters, two letters were replaced (e.g., ripasote, from riposato "rested"). All non-words were constrained to end in -e to reflect the most common word ending and to prevent participants from relying on sub-lexical strategies during the lexical decision task. Non-words were matched to words in length.</p><p>Face stimuli were the same used in our previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Serafini &amp; Pesciarelli, 2025</ref>) and consisted of one female and one male face exemplar, selected from the Chicago Face Database <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Ma et al., 2015)</ref>. The two exemplars resulted highly prototypical of the female and male gender categories (see details in <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Serafini &amp; Pesciarelli, 2025</ref>) (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</p><p>When faces appeared in the target position, each stereotypical prime word was paired with either a female or male face, resulting in two stereotypically congruent conditions (pugile "boxer"male face, colf "maid" -female face) and two stereotypically incongruent conditions (pugile "boxer"female face, colf "maid" -male face). When words appeared in the target position, each prime face was paired with a stereotypically male or female word, resulting in two stereotypically congruent conditions (male face -pugile "boxer", female face -colf "maid") and two stereotypically incongruent conditions (male face -colf "maid," female face -pugile "boxer" ). Thus, each stereotypical word appeared four times throughout the whole experiment, twice in the prime position and twice in the target position.</p><p>Each condition consisted of 30 trials, for a total of 240 experimental trials.</p><p>Each filler word was also paired with both the male and female face, and appeared both in the target position (ospite "guest" -male face, ospite "guest" -female face), and in the prime position (male face -ospite "guest", female face -ospite "guest"). Each filler condition consisted of 30 trials, for a total of 120 filler trials. Additionally, the male and female prime faces were paired with non-words, creating two non-word conditions (male face -matore, female face -matore). Each non-word condition consisted of 90 trials, for a total of 180 trials. In total, participants completed 540 trials.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Design and procedure</head><p>Participants were comfortably seated in a darkened, electrically shielded and sound-attenuated room. An example of the experimental procedure is illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. the target (sequence on the left), and the other in which the word is the target (sequence on the right).</p><p>In the first condition, the prime is a stereotypically associated word and the target is a face, which could be either gender-congruent (insegnante "teacher"-female face; conducente "driver"-male face) or gender-incongruent (insegnante "teacher"-male face; conducente "driver"-female face). In the second condition, the prime is a face and the target is a stereotypically associated word, which could be either gender-congruent (female face -insegnante "teacher"; male face -conducente "driver") or genderincongruent (male face -insegnante "teacher"; female face -conducente "driver"). Displayed are the two face exemplars used in the experiment, together with two sample words from the stimulus set.</p><p>The procedure was adapted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Serafini and Pesciarelli (2025)</ref>. In the center of the monitor, a fixation cross (+) appeared until the participant's response (note, in Serafini &amp; Pesciarelli, it appeared for 500ms). Next, a blank screen appeared for 500ms, then the prime word or face was displayed on the screen for 300ms, followed by a blank screen for 200ms. Subsequently, the target word (stereotypically male or female) or face (male or female) appeared and remained on the screen until the participant's response. A blank screen of 1000ms followed each trial. Participants were instructed to decide, as quickly and as accurately as possible, whether the letter string was a word or a non-word (lexical decision task), or whether the face was male or female (gender categorization task). Participants responded by pressing one of two keys, counterbalanced (left, right) across participants, using their right and left indices.</p><p>Trials were organized in six blocks, three consecutive with target faces and three consecutive with target words/non-words, counterbalanced across participants. Blocks with target faces contained 60 trials each: 30 with female target faces, 30 with male target faces. Blocks with target words contained 120 trials each: 40 with stereotypical target words, 20 with filler target words, and 60 with target non-words. Repetitions of the same word appeared in different blocks and the blocks' order was counterbalanced across participants. Prime-target pairs were randomized within each block prior to presentation.</p><p>Before the experiment, participants completed two training sessions, one consisting of 12 prime-target pairs with word/non-word targets, and one consisting of six prime-target pairs with face targets. All conditions appeared once, with different stimuli than those used in the experimental session.</p><p>After the experiment, to measure individual stereotypical gender attitudes participants completed the Bem Sex Role Inventory (BSRI) <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Gaudreau, 1977)</ref> and the Ambivalence Sexism Inventory (ASI) <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Glick &amp; Fiske, 1996)</ref> (see "Supplementary material" for analyses of these questionnaires).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">EEG recording and analysis</head><p>EEG was recorded using the same system, setup and settings as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Serafini and Pesciarelli (2025)</ref> (see full details in the "Supplementary Material" of <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Serafini &amp; Pesciarelli, 2025)</ref>. In sum, EEG signal was recorded at a sampling rate of 1000Hz with an ActiCHamp Plus (BrainProducts) system from 64 active electrodes (ActiCap Slim, BrainProducts). EEG signal was downsampled to 500Hz, re-referenced to the average mastoid activity, and band-pass filtered from 0.01 to 80Hz. Compromised channels were interpolated, and EEG signal was corrected for ocular and motion artifacts. A maximum of 3 channels were interpolated per participant (i.e., 4.69% of all channels). Continuous EEG signal was segmented from -200 to 800ms epochs time-locked to the target onset (instead of till 1000ms, as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Serafini &amp; Pesciarelli, 2025)</ref>, and 200-ms-baseline corrected. Epochs associated with correct responses were averaged across 8 conditions (mean number of epochs per condition = 28.27, SD = 0.56, range = 27.58-28.94). Lost data due to artifacts or incorrect responses was equal to 5.78% (SD = 2.76%). We adopted a data-driven approach to leverage the rich spatiotemporal information of the EEG signal, providing a comprehensive perspective on the observed effects. Specifically, we conducted mass univariate analyses in Brainstorm <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Tadel et al., 2011)</ref>, using cluster-based permutation tests to correct for multiple comparisons <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Maris and Oostenveld, 2007)</ref>, via the implemented FieldTrip function <ref type="bibr">(Oostenvelt et al., 2011)</ref>.</p><p>To keep consistency with our previous study and the literature, we complemented the datadriven analyses with conventional ERP analyses performed on a priori defined time windows and electrodes (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Groppe et al., 2011)</ref>. For target face onset, based on visual inspection of aggregated grand-averaged ERP waveforms and in line with previous literature (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Pesciarelli et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Serafini &amp; Pesciarelli, 2025;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Siyanova-Chanturia et al., 2012)</ref>, the following components were identified at frontal (F3, Fz, F4), central (C3, Cz, C4) and parietal (P3, Pz, P4) scalp sites: N200 from 170 to 250ms after target onset; N400 from 250 to 400ms after target onset; P300 from 300 to 500ms after target onset; LPP from 600 to 800ms after target onset. For target word onset, based on visual inspection of aggregated grandaveraged ERP waveforms and in line with previous literature (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Pesciarelli et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Serafini &amp; Pesciarelli, 2025)</ref>, the following components were identified at the same scalp sites: N400 from 250 to 450ms after target onset; P300 from 450 to 650ms after target onset. For each ERP component, amplitude was measured as mean activity within the respective time window.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.">Statistical analyses</head><p>Statistical analyses were performed in JASP (Version 0.17.2.1; JASP Team, 2022). Behavioral analyses were conducted only on trials with response latencies within ± 2SD from each mean (rejected trials were on average 0.04%). Considering that face targets and word targets result in very different response and ERP latencies, we did not perform an omnibus ANOVA including the factor Target Type (face, word) but performed separate ANOVAs for face and word targets. The mean RTs of correct responses per condition and the mean ERP amplitudes of correct trials were submitted to repeatedmeasure ANOVAs with the within-subject factors Congruency (congruent, incongruent) and Target Gender (male, female). Longitude (anterior, central, posterior) and Latitude (left, midline, right) were additional within-subject factors only for ERP analyses. The levels corresponded to the mean activity of F3, Fz, F4 (Anterior), C3, Cz, C4 (Central), P3, Pz, P4 (Posterior), F3, C3, P3 (Left), Fz, Cz, Pz (Midline) and F4, C4, P4 (Right). When Target Gender significantly interacted with Congruency, indicating a different priming effect depending on target gender (as predicted from our previous findings), separate ANOVAs for female and male targets were performed with the within-subject factor Prime Gender (male, female) and, for the EEG side, Latitude and Longitude. We also conducted the same ANOVAs, including the between-subject factor Participant Gender (women, men), and, exclusively for the behavioral analyses, Task Order (target face first, target word first). Degrees of freedom were adjusted according to the Greenhouse-Geisser method; only corrected significance levels are reported. The level of significance testing was p = .05. Main effects and interactions that do not involve priming effects (i.e., not involving the effect of Congruency or Prime Gender for the ANOVAs separated for target gender) are not central to the research question and are therefore not reported. Hit rates were not analyzed due to ceiling effect, with all conditions averaging 95-99% correct.</p><p>To perform mass univariate analyses on the EEG signal, individual averages per electrode per condition were imported in Brainstorm. Two-tailed paired t-tests were applied to compare incongruent and congruent conditions for female face target, male face target, stereotypically female word target, and stereotypically male word targets, at all electrode sites within the 200-800 ms post-stimulus time window. Clusters were formed by including adjacent electrodes and time points with t-scores exceeding ±2.36, corresponding to an uncorrected p-value of 0.05 for a single test, without requiring a minimum number of neighboring electrodes below this threshold to form a cluster. The spatial neighborhood for each electrode consisted of 5.4 neighboring electrodes per site on average. T-scores within each cluster were summed to compute a cluster-level t-score. Each cluster was assigned a p-value based on its ranking within the null distribution of the most extreme cluster-level t-scores, generated through 1,000 permutations using a Monte Carlo approximation.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p>The aim of the present study was two-fold: (i) to replicate the neural gender stereotype asymmetry found in our previous word-face priming paradigm <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Serafini &amp; Pesciarelli, 2025)</ref>, (ii) to investigate whether the asymmetry was maintained by inverting the order of the information stream, using a reversed face-word priming paradigm. To our knowledge, the present study represents the first ERP investigation combining both presentation orders within the same priming study in the context of gender stereotypes. We recorded RTs and ERPs while participants categorized by gender female and male faces, primed by stereotypically female or male words (replicated condition), or performed a lexical decision task on stereotypically female and male words and non-words, primed by female and male faces (novel condition). Results revealed the expected ERP gender stereotype asymmetry when faces were targets, and a novel consistent but partial asymmetry when words were targets.</p><p>At both behavioral and neural levels, we successfully replicated our earlier findings concerning gender stereotype priming effects for face targets. Behaviorally, face gender categorization was faster when faces were preceded by gender-congruent primes, echoing established findings from both linguistic priming (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Banaji &amp; Hardin, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Cacciari &amp; Padovani, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Casado et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Pesciarelli et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Siyanova-Chanturia et al., 2012)</ref>, and facial non-priming research (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Becker et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Dzhelyova et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Le Gal &amp; Bruce, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Fitousi, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Zhu et al., 2020)</ref>. The ERP effects also replicated a gender-based asymmetry. Both data-driven and conventional analyses showed that violations of female-related stereotypes by a male face (e.g., badante "caregiver"-male face) elicited an early N400 effect, consistent with the idea of a semantic expectancy violation <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Kutas &amp; Hillyard, 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Kutas &amp; Federmeier, 2011)</ref>, while violations of male-related stereotypes by a female face (e.g., falegname "carpenter"-female face) elicited a later P300/LPP effect, possibly indicating enhanced evaluative processing, or perceived improbability and context updating <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Donchin, 1981;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Duncan-Johnson &amp; Donchin, 1977;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Sutton &amp; Ruchkin, 1984)</ref>. These results again align with previous ERP findings in language-exclusive tasks (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Irmen et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Proverbio et al., 2018 in men;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Siyanova-Chanturia et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Su et al., 2016</ref>; but see <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Weinstein et al., 2025</ref> for a congruence effect), and with Rodríguez-Gómez et al. ( <ref type="formula">2020</ref>)'s study using both words and faces, finding a seemingly more complex processing of female-related gender stereotype as indexed by a various LPP effect.</p><p>While the asymmetry itself replicates our previous results, there were differences in the temporal and topographical properties of the effects. The N400 here exhibited a more centro-parietal distribution, in line with classic semantic processing studies and our previous studies using target pronouns <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Pesciarelli et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Siyanova-Chanturia et al., 2012)</ref>, whereas in the replicated study we observed a more fronto-central distribution. The late positivity, while again present, showed a longer latency (600-750 ms), and a more frontal distribution as compared to the previously observed centroparietally distributed one. The slightly slower response latencies compared to our previous study <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Serafini &amp; Pesciarelli, 2025)</ref> likely reflect the successful reduction of automatic response tendencies due to procedural changes (e.g., reintroducing a spacebar press to start each trial, emphasizing the importance of reading the prime words). They also aligned with those observed in previous priming studies on pronouns <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Cacciari &amp; Padovani, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Pesciarelli et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Siyanova-Chanturia et al., 2012)</ref>.</p><p>It is possible that the more typical response latencies contributed to these ERP patterns, which may reflect a more traditional processing sequence when response automatism is minimized. However, further replication is needed to confirm this interpretation. In this study as compared to the previous, the positive effect appears to reflect an LPP rather than a P300, which can be differently interpreted as enhanced effort and/or attentional engagement during evaluative processing <ref type="bibr">(Hajcak &amp; Foti, 2020)</ref>, possibly indicative of an implicit negative evaluation of female faces presented in male-stereotypical contexts. Overall, the replication reinforced the evidence for a gender stereotype asymmetry in face processing.</p><p>The face-word priming condition represents the novelty of this study. While prior priming studies have investigated the neural correlates of gender stereotyping using faces as targets, no ERP research to date has examined the reverse direction: the neural processing of stereotype-related words primed by congruent or incongruent facial gender cues. At the behavioral level, we found an unexpected gender stereotype asymmetry. Stereotypically female words were categorized faster as belonging to the word category when preceded by gender congruent face primes (e.g., female face-badante "caregiver" vs. male face-badante "caregiver). However, for stereotypically male words an inverse priming effect emerged: faster responses occurred following gender incongruent face primes (e.g., female facefalegname "carpenter" vs. male face-falegname "carpenter"). This reversal is atypical and not easily explained by conventional priming mechanisms (see <ref type="bibr">Habibi &amp; Khurana, 2002, exp.2;</ref><ref type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2019, exp.1, 3</ref> for typical priming effects in similar studies). One interpretation of our findings is that participants may have consciously or unconsciously inferred the study's aims and responded in ways that reflect evolving societal attitudes-namely, greater familiarity or comfort with women in traditionally male roles. This awareness could be justified by the absence of grammatical control conditions, despite the inclusion of filler trials. This interpretation aligns with the one provided for the inverse ERP priming reported by <ref type="bibr">Rodriguez et al. (2020)</ref>, who used a more explicit task. Despite reversed behavioral priming effects have not yet been reported in gender stereotype contexts, behavioral asymmetries have nonetheless emerged, showing more consistent priming when female stereotypes were violated by male referents <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Chalyvidou &amp; Weber, 2025;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Reali et al., 2015)</ref>, or an inhibition of the processing of male pronouns after female stereotypes <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Cacciari &amp; Padovani, 2007)</ref>. The results from our study fits into this literature, overall suggesting heightened sensitivity to violations of female stereotypes.</p><p>An alternative interpretation could lie in the most various behavioral scenarios expected when using a lexical decision task <ref type="bibr">(Kidder et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">White et al., 2018)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">White et al. (2018)</ref> found that priming effects were inconsistent in lexical decision tasks. Similarly, <ref type="bibr">Kidder et al.'s (2017)</ref> meta-analysis showed stronger effects for tasks. These findings suggest that stereotype priming likely relies on both semantic and response associations, as evaluative priming <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Herring et al., 2013)</ref>. In gender categorization, primes activate both meaning and response tendencies, whereas lexical decision tasks engage only semantic processing, likely reducing the effect. Thus, the effect needs further replication, possibly using a more potent task.</p><p>Underlying this atypical behavioral effect, both data driven and conventional ERP analyses showed that stereotypically male words elicited a larger P300 when primed by a gender-incongruent than congruent face (e.g., female face -falegname "carpenter" vs. male face -falegname "carpenter").</p><p>No corresponding ERP effect was found in response to stereotypically female words, condition in which the behavioral priming showed the typical pattern. Thus, our ERP findings on the target words revealed a partial gender stereotype asymmetry. This constitutes a novel finding, extending previous knowledge, by examining for the first time the ERP correlates of the processing of stereotype-conveying words primed by female and male faces. When gender cues preceded stereotyped content, a gender stereotype asymmetry was only reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Weinstein et al. (2025)</ref>. They contrarily found a larger N400 effect for female-related rather than male-related adjectives following male referents (e.g., hombresensible "man-sensitive" vs. hombre-fuerte, "man -strong") -but no such effect for the female referent. As for Weinstein et al., who found the N400 effect (i.e., a negativity) in response to the female-related adjective, we also found an apparently reversed effect (i.e., more positive for male targets) as compared to the one we found on target faces. We argue that it could reflects the same mechanism as for the reversed order: lower perceived probability of ascribing stereotypically male attributes to women than to men, as for the interpretation of a P300 <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Donchin, 1981;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Duncan-Johnson &amp; Donchin, 1977;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Sutton &amp; Ruchkin, 1984)</ref>. Nonetheless, these words could still be responded to faster when primed by incongruent than congruent faces due to a possible awareness of the study's scope.</p><p>Notably, our ERP study investigated both presentation orders within the same priming experiment, which was so far not attempted. We showed that, as the separate literature suggested, the priming paradigm worked similarly irrespective of the order of the information stream <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Pesciarelli et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Siyanova-Chanturia et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Wang et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">White et al., 2009)</ref>, which appear not to be the case for sentence comprehension paradigms that are more sensitive to the information order (see <ref type="bibr">Porkert et al., 2014</ref> for a review). Further, when faces are included and asymmetries are considered, the priming effect in gender stereotype contexts is indeed more nuanced, involving also a positive effect, which so far never showed sensitivity to stereotype violations by stereotype-conveying targets. Also, gender stereotype asymmetries on late positive effects so far only emerged when the target was the gender-conveying word <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Irmen et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Rodríguez-Gómez et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Serafini &amp; Pesciarelli, 2025;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Su et al., 2016</ref><ref type="bibr">, but see Proverbio et al., 2018</ref> with mixed presentation order). While the word-face and face-word conditions are not fully comparable, given that they differ in stimulus variability (e.g., one face vs. multiple words per category) and task implicitness, they revealed a comparable asymmetry in gender stereotype activation. Critically, observing this effect even under less explicitly gender-focused tasks (i.e., a lexical decision task) reinforces the view that such biases operate automatically, beyond conscious intention or task demands, a claim further supported by our masked priming findings <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Pesciarelli et al., 2019)</ref>.</p><p>To conclude, this study provides compelling evidence for neural gender stereotype asymmetries, which consistently emerge beyond language processing, across replications, and regardless of the order of information presentation-strongly suggesting that female-and male-related stereotypes operate through different cognitive mechanisms. This evidence has significant implications for how we study, understand, and ultimately intervene in gender bias, highlighting the need to consider female-and male-related stereotypes as distinct phenomena.</p></div>
