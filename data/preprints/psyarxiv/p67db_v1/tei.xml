<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Large Language Models can transform individuals' mental health descriptions into scores that correlate with rating scales approaching theoretical upper limits. However, such analyses have combined word-and text-responses with little known about their differences. We develop response formats ranging from closed-ended to open-ended: 1) select words from lists, write 2) descriptive words, 3) phrases, or 4) texts. Participants answered questions about their depression/worry using the response formats and related rating scales. Language responses were transformed into word embeddings and trained to rating scales. We compare the validity (concurrent, incremental, face, discriminant, and external validity) and reliability (prospective sample and test-retest reliability) of the response formats. Using the Sequential Evaluation with Model Pre-registration design, machine-learning models were trained on a development dataset (N=963), and then pre-registered before tested on a prospective sample (N=145). The pre-registered models demonstrate strong validity and reliability, yielding high accuracy in the prospective sample (r=.60-.79). Additionally, the models demonstrated external validity to self-reported sick-leave/healthcare visits, where the text-format yielded the strongest correlations (being higher/equal to rating scales for 9 of 12 cases). The overall high validity and reliability across formats suggest the possibility of choosing formats according to clinical needs.</p></div>

AI-based language analyses have successfully been used in research for psychological assessments of, for example, personality (converging with rating scales; <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Cutler, &amp; Condon, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Kwantes et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Schwartz et al., 2013)</ref>, depression (from medical records, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Eichstaedt et al., 2018, and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Vaci et al., 2020</ref>; assessed with rating scales in <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Matero et al., 2021)</ref>, and anxiety (assessed with rating scales, <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Rutowski et al., 2020)</ref>. The types of language that have been used for computational language assessments have ranged from social media texts (e.g., from Facebook <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[Marengo et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Park et al., 2015]</ref> and Twitter <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[Coppersmith et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Eichstaedt et al., 2015]</ref>), audio recordings of everyday conversations <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Gumus et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Sun et al., 2020)</ref>, and open-ended responses to prompted questions (O.N.E. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Kjell et al., 2019)</ref>. The latter approach recently yielded the highest accuracy in converging with rating scales, where respondents described their state of mind with descriptive words and text responses (O.N. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">E Kjell et al., 2022)</ref>. Combining responses of different formats (words and text responses) across different construct questions (responses about harmony in life and satisfaction with life) was used to assess well-being rating scales with an accuracy (r = .85, N = 608) approaching the rating scales' own reliability (r = .71-.84, N = 608), which is considered a theoretical upper limit of assessment accuracy (O.N.E. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Kjell et al., 2022)</ref>.</p><p>The overall aim of this study is to develop and evaluate open-ended response formats for assessing mental states, with a focus on enhancing clinical utility. Mental health assessments are critical for effective diagnosis, treatment planning, and monitoring progress <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Hunsley &amp; Mash, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Shen et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Stahnke, 2021)</ref>. Current methods, such as rating scales, are limited in their ability to comprehensively capture the complexity of patients' unique subjective experiences <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Fried, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Kjell et al., 2024)</ref>, which can lead to missed nuances and suboptimal treatment outcomes. To address these challenges, this study develops and evaluates different response formats ranging from closed to more open, including 1) selecting descriptive words from pre-defined word lists (the select words format) and writing their own, 2) descriptive words (the write words format), 3) descriptive phrases (the write phrases format), or 4) descriptive texts (the write texts format).</p><p>The focus is on the two most common mental health conditions: depression and anxiety/worry, where self-reported subjective and behavioral experiences (e.g., low mood, worry, sleep disturbances) are key symptoms. Our selection of response formats offer varying levels of openness to describe relevant experiences, enabling a tailored approach to assessment that can potentially balance the need for brevity with the richness of open-ended responses. By exploring these formats, this study aims to provide clinicians and researchers with tools that can achieve high accuracy and reliability as well as offer more comprehensive insights into patients' mental health experiences.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Current Clinical Assessment Practices and Limitations</head><p>Current clinical practices primarily rely on a combination of closed-ended rating scales and unstructured clinical interviews to assess mental health problems. In an international survey of clinicians from the US (N = 148), the UK (N = 162), the Netherlands (N = 105), and Sweden (N = 127), revealed that clinicians working with mental health assessments primarily use unstructured clinical interviews (83%) and rating scales (83%), followed by semi-structured interviews (65%) and structured interviews (40%; <ref type="bibr">Navandi et al., in preparation)</ref>. The survey also highlighted that mental health assessments require a significant investment of clinicians' time, with a median reported assessment time of 60 minutes, underscoring the time-intensive nature of current practices.</p><p>Unstructured interviews allow clinicians to explore patients' mental health in a more open-ended and conversational manner. However, these interviews are often time-intensive, require significant clinical expertise, and their reliability can vary widely <ref type="bibr">(Regier, et al., 2013)</ref>. Semi-structured and structured interviews offer greater standardisation and reliability, but they remain time-consuming and may still rely on the clinician's interpretation for nuanced responses <ref type="bibr">(Hoffman et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Lundqvist et al., 2022)</ref>. The validity of clinical judgment is also compromised by cognitive biases and factors that increase susceptibility to errors, such as clinician fatigue <ref type="bibr">(Bowes et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Saposnik et al., 2016)</ref>.</p><p>The quantification of psychological assessments has typically been achieved using closed-ended rating scales-based on questions or statements coupled with a limited set of pre-defined, categorical, or rating scale-based response formats (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Likert, 1932</ref>). The closed-ended format provides consistency through predefined questions and response options, which are easy to administer. However, the closed-ended format of rating scales inherently limits the comprehensiveness and nuance of the information they can capture, often reducing patients' complex mental health experiences into closed-ended, forced-choice responses <ref type="bibr">(Kjell et al., 2024)</ref>. This closed-ended format restricts respondents from fully expressing their unique symptoms and experiences <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Kjell et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Pennebaker &amp; Beall, 1986)</ref>. Moreover, the closed-ended format comes with the risk that the scale developers potentially miss important aspects to capture a diagnosis or psychological construct <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Fried et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Kjell, 2011)</ref>.</p><p>These limitations emphasise the need for more open-ended assessment methods that are also reliable in capturing the subjective and multifaceted nature of mental health problems. Open-ended language-based assessments offer a promising alternative, leveraging natural language responses to enable individuals to describe their unique experiences while producing reliable measurements with high accuracy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Natural Language as the Foundation of Psychological Assessments</head><p>Language is at the core of the communication between patients and clinicians in clinical settings, playing a key role in assessment, treatment as well as evaluation of progress <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Cruz &amp; Pincus, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Greenberg &amp; Pascual-Leone, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Levinson &amp; Holler, 2014</ref>). An open-ended approach using natural language as a foundation for quantitatively assessing mental states has many potential benefits. First, natural language is the natural way of communicating complex psychological states of mind (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Tausczik &amp; Pennebaker, 2010)</ref>. Second, natural language comprises great measurement characteristics, including high range, resolution, dimensionality, and openness (O.N.E. <ref type="bibr">Kjell et al., 2024)</ref>. The range in language facilitates the description of extremes (e.g., despondent and euphoric). The resolution in language enables descriptions of detailed nuances <ref type="bibr">(e.g., despondent, sad, happy, euphoric)</ref>. The multi-dimensionality of language facilitates capturing complex states that vary in more than one-dimension (e.g., both valence and arousal). The openness of language affords the option to create personal responses, which is very difficult to capture exhaustively with predefined alternatives.</p><p>Third, the openness of language can enhance the content validity of mental health assessments by capturing a broader and more comprehensive representation of clinical constructs (e.g., depressive disorders). In contrast, the omission of important response alternatives in closed-ended methods can undermine construct validity by failing to account for the full breadth and complexity of the targeted disorder. For example, mental pain is commonly reported as a significant aspect of depression. To identify symptoms that matter most to patients, <ref type="bibr">Chevance et al. (2020)</ref> asked participants to describe "the most difficult aspect of depression to live with or endure." They found that "mental pain" was the most frequently mentioned symptom. Yet, it is notably absent from the DSM-5 criteria and the closed-ended rating scales commonly used to assess depression, including those in this study. In previous studies using language-based assessments, descriptive words such as "painful" emerged as significantly related to high depression <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Kjell et al., 2021)</ref>. This highlights the limitations of predefined response categories and the potential of open-ended responses in capturing the comprehensive spectrum of patients' experiences.</p><p>Fourth, language-based responses also carry more information than closed-ended responses. Based on the information theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Shannon, 1948)</ref>, research has shown that natural language-based responses carry 4.8 times more information than closed-ended rating scales (O.N.E. <ref type="bibr">Kjell et al., 2024)</ref>, offering richer data. These favourable measurement characteristics indicate that using language-based responses has the potential to improve mental health assessments. This study focuses on comparing the characteristics of different response formats.</p><p>Different response formats may differ in multiple relevant dimensions for assessment, such as the type and amount of information they capture, the assessment accuracy they produce, the way responses can be visualised, and the time taken for patients to complete them. Additionally, asking respondents to answer the same question using different response formats may encourage more thorough answers, as each format may elicit different perspectives and capture unique information. Such an approach aligns with the cognitive interview theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Willis, 2004)</ref>, which emphasises how different questions can activate diverse cognitive processes, leading to the retrieval and articulation of different facets of an individual's experience, resulting in a more comprehensive answer. Hence, the response formats might complement each other, potentially enhancing the overall accuracy of a mental health assessment when combined (i.e., incremental validity).</p><p>Probed-based computational language assessments, where respondents describe their answers using natural language that is analyzed with AI, have shown promise in assessing psychological constructs with high validity. Computational language assessments where respondents describe their depression, worry, harmony in life, and satisfaction with life using descriptive words have been demonstrated to measure the degree of the constructs (i.e., concurrent validity; O.N.E. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Kjell et al., 2019)</ref>. Computational language assessments have further been shown to describe and differentiate well between similar constructs; for example, statistically significant words describe and differentiate well between depression versus worry, where, when compared with each other, depression is related with theoretically relevant words such as sad, worthless, and lonely, and worry with words such as anxious, nervous, and scared. Hence, these analyses have shown that language-based assessments have high face validity; here, we will examine how well the different response formats describe the different constructs and their face validity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Response Format</head><p>To date, respondents have been asked to answer the questions using descriptive words or descriptive text (O.N. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">E Kjell et al., 2019)</ref>. Initially, the answers were analyzed using a bag-of-words approach called Latent Semantic Analyses <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Landauer &amp; Dumais, 1997)</ref> -where words are represented with a numeric representation that does not take the order and context of a word into account. This bag-of-words technique produced considerably more accurate results with the descriptive words (r = .34-.72, N = 91-852) than with the descriptive text format (r = .19-.49, N = 92-689; O.N.E. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Kjell et al., 2019)</ref>. A re-analysis of the data, with a large language model (based on a technique called transformers; <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Vaswani et al., 2017)</ref> -that takes words' order and context into account -has produced high accuracy for both descriptive words (r = .66 -.79, N = 608; O.N.E. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Kjell et al., 2022)</ref> and descriptive texts (r = .61 -.74, N = 608; O.N.E. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Kjell et al., 2022)</ref>. The research has also demonstrated that combining the two response formats for two different constructs produces even higher accuracies (incremental validity; r = .85, p &lt; .001, N = 608) that rival the rating scales' own reliability as measured with test-retest correlation, corrected item-total correlation average, and inter-item correlation average (r = .71 -.84, N = 608). This accuracy is an essential achievement because the scale's own reliability can be seen as a theoretical upper limit of predicting it. Hence, the large language models have opened up the possibility of using more complex response formats while attaining high measurement accuracy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Large Language Models in Natural Language Processing (NLP)</head><p>Large language models are now the foundation for most state-of-the-art AI-language systems and have been described as a "paradigm shift" <ref type="bibr">(Bommasani et al., 2021, p. 1)</ref>. Large language models can efficiently represent a word's meaning based on the context in which they were used. The context a word is in plays a vital role in determining its meaning. For example, consider how the context changes the meaning of the word play in the previous sentence, as compared with "I play my guitar" versus "I watched a play". This technique has led to increased accuracy in standard Natural Language Processing tasks such as grammatical acceptability <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Warstadt et al., 2019)</ref> and question answering <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Rajpurkar et al., 2018)</ref>. The ability of large language models to more accurately represent language may provide more options for using different response formats. Whereas previous computational language assessments have found the highest assessment accuracy of the write words response format, the advent of large language models that more accurately account for grammar and syntax, including word order, may provide even higher accuracy than those previously achieved.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Depression and Anxiety</head><p>Here, we focus on assessing depression and anxiety for three primary reasons. First, depression and anxiety are highly prevalent in the general population, representing two of the most common mental health conditions globally <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Baxter et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Lรฉpine &amp; Briley, 2011)</ref>. Given their high prevalence, improving assessment methods for these conditions has significant utility. Second, the assessment of depression and anxiety heavily relies on subjective experiences, as these disorders are characterised by internal states such as low mood and worry (e.g., see the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, DSM-5; American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Open-ended language-based assessments provide an opportunity to more comprehensively quantify these subjective experiences. Last, previous research using language-based assessments shows that writing words to describe one's level of depression and anxiety significantly converges with the individual item scores and total scores of corresponding rating scales (K., <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Kjell et al, 2021)</ref>. In this study, we build on these insights to examine whether different response formats can further improve the assessment validity and reliability of depression and anxiety measures.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Research Questions and Hypotheses</head><p>We evaluate the four response formats: 1) the select words, 2) the write words, 3) the write phrases, and 4) the write texts response format according to their:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Validity of models during development i)</head><p>Concurrent (criterion) validity. How well do they converge with rating scale scores? ii)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Concurrent (criterion) validity across sample sizes.</head><p>To what extent does the model accuracy increase with larger training sample sizes? iii)</p><p>Incremental validity. How well do combinations of response formats converge incrementally with rating scales? iv) Face validity. Is the language that is predictive of depression versus anxiety face valid (when depicted in word vizualisations)? v) Discriminant validity. How well do they differentiate between depression and anxiety?</p><p>Validity and reliability of pre-registered models vi) Prospective sample reliability. How accurate (convergence with rating scales) are pre-registered models on data from a new set of participants? This part involved two pre-registered hypotheses stating that the pre-registered models of depression and anxiety/worry yield scores that: a) are positively associated with corresponding rating scale scores, and b) achieve at least a moderate correlation r &gt; .50 for total scores where depression language predicts depression rating scales and worry language predicts worry/anxiety rating scale scores (note that the 99% confidence interval for the lowest correlation in the training set [r = .59] is above .50 [.53 -.64 N = 963]). vii) Test re-test reliability in a prospective sample. How high is the two-week test-retest correlation for the pre-registered models?</p><p>viii) External validity in a prospective sample. How well do the pre-registered models' predictions correlate with a few self-reported behaviors associated with depression and anxiety (e.g., sick leave due to mental health issues)?</p><p>Descriptive characteristics of the response formats ix) Information content. How much information content is captured by each response format?</p><p>x) Time burden. What is the response time for each format?</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methodological Disclosure and Data Accessibility Statement</head><p>We report how we determined our sample size, all data exclusions, all manipulations, and all measures in the study. We make all the research materials, and the anonymised prospective data, publicly available anonymously at the OSF (https://osf.io/syren/?view_only=9eebf3e448b447ae89dd288d3107cb03).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head><p>We use the Sequential Evaluation with Model Pre-registration (SEMP; O.N.E. <ref type="bibr">Kjell et al., 2024)</ref> study design, which aspires to adhere to good scientific practices (i.e., pre-registration) combined with development practices for achieving robust AI model evaluation (e.g., out-of-sample testing). Here, SEMP involves registering models developed in a development set (N = 963) and pre-registering hypotheses before testing them on a new prospective participant set (N = 150).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>The development data: Participants were recruited online using Prolific <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Palan &amp; Schitter, 2018)</ref>   <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Kjell et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">2016)</ref>. In the training set, 7 participants had missing data in the write text response format questions (7 missing for the depression and 3 missing for the worry questions).</p><p>The prospective test data: Participants (N = 150) in the prospective test data were also collected from Prolific in January 2024 (i.e., collected 41 months after the development set). The size was based on finding reliable estimates of the correlations that we were interested in from analyses of the training dataset. Five participants were excluded from the analyses: three did not pass the attention check items, and two did not respond to the write text questions of depression and anxiety<ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">2</ref> . The rest of the participants (N = 145) were further invited to take part in a longitudinal study with two weeks between Time 1 and 2 (T1, T2). At T1, participants had a mean age of 41.6 (SD = 12.6, range = 19 -81) years; 101 female, 43 male, and 1 other. Their reported nationality included 126 from the U.K., 5 from the U.S., and 14 from other countries. At T2, 122 (84.1%) participants returned to answer the same survey again; they have an average age of 42.3 (SD = 12.6; range = 19 -81) years, and 87 identified as female, 34 as male, and 1 as other. All participants in the prospective test data have English as their first language.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Screening Question</head><p>The participants were asked to report whether they had any previous or ongoing diagnosis of MDD, GAD, or other mental health problems (see Supplement Appendix (SA) 1 for details).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Response Format Questions</head><p>The open-ended response format for descriptive words (developed by O.N.E <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Kjell et al., 2019)</ref> was used and adapted for the different response formats. Previous research piloted different question prompts and instructions, finding that this format with a question prompt coupled with instructions to elaborate using open-ended responses works very well <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Kjell et al., 2019)</ref>. An example question of the write phrases and write text formats are exemplified below:</p><p>Over the last 2 weeks, have you been depressed or not?</p><p>Please answer the question by typing 5 descriptive words or phrases below that indicate whether you have been depressed or not. For example, if you have been depressed, then write more and stronger words or phrases describing this, and if you have not been depressed, then write more and stronger words or phrases describing that.</p><p>Write descriptive words or phrases relating to those aspects that are most important and meaningful to you.</p><p>Write one to five words in each box.</p></div>

The list of words in the select words format, comprised the 31 most frequent words participants used to describe their depression (e.g., blue, lonely, tired, hopeful, happy) or worry (e.g., anxious, nervous, worried, calm, peaceful) in previous research (O.N.E. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Kjell et a., 2019</ref>; see SA3 for the lists).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Rating scales</head><p>Several commonly used clinical scales are used to measure depression and anxiety severity, with the aim for the scales to complement each other. The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 for depression (PHQ-9, <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Spitzer et al., 1999)</ref> and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 for anxiety (GAD-7, <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Spitzer et al., 2006)</ref> are closely aligned with the symptoms defined in the DSM manual for Major Depressive Disorder and Generalized Anxiety Disorder, respectively. The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D, <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Radloff, 1977)</ref> complements the PHQ-9 by including some depression-related symptoms not included in the DSM, such as indirectly related interpersonal issues. The Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ, <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Meyer et al., 1990)</ref> complements the GAD-7 by focusing on experiences of worry.</p><p>The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). The PHQ-9 <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Spitzer et al., 1999)</ref> measures major depressive disorder as defined in the DSM-IV. The rating scale comprises nine items addressing symptoms such as "Little interest or pleasure in doing things". The scale uses a four-point scale (0 = Not at all to 3 = Nearly every day). The items refer to experiences from the last two weeks. In the current study, Cronbach's alpha was .95, and MacDonald's hierarchical omega was .84.</p></div>

All participants provided their consent to take part and that their anonymized data could be shared openly. Then, participants are asked whether they previously had been diagnosed with MDD, GAD, or any other mental health problems. After that, the survey had five parts: First, participants answered the three open-ended response formats (i.e., write words, phrases, and texts), which were presented in random order across participants. Second, they answered the select words questions. Third, they filled out the rating scales: the PHQ-9, the CES-D, the GAD-7, and the PSWQ, which were randomized. Last, they reported the demographics and mental health-related sick-leave and healthcare visits. Participants completed the study in a median time of 20.1 (mean = 24.0, SD = 12.8) minutes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analytical methods</head><p>The analyses were conducted in R (R Core Team, 2018) and the text-package (version 1.2.1; O.N.E. <ref type="bibr">Kjell et al., 2023)</ref>. The text-package enables social scientists to access open large language models, and machine learning and natural language processing methods. We employed large language models to convert language responses into word embeddings (i.e., numerical representation). These embeddings were then used as predictors in training regression-based machine-learning techniques to predict scale scores.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pre-trained word embeddings</head><p>We use a large language model called RoBERTa-large <ref type="bibr">(Liu et al., 2019)</ref>, which has been developed from text from Wikipedia and books. The RoBERTa-Large model has demonstrated strong alignment between language-based assessments and a range of psychological constructs, incorporating both self-reports and expert evaluations <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Ganesan et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Matero et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Varadarajan et al., 2024)</ref>. We did not pre-process the text data; however, RoBERTa-large automatically tokenises text using the Byte-Pair Encoding <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Sennrich, 2015)</ref>. RoBERTa-large represents each word (token) across 24 layers, each with 1024 dimensions. Only the second-to-last layer is used here, as empirical research shows that these work well for representing the meaning of words when modeling human-level language tasks such as assessing mental health issues <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Ganesan et al., 2021)</ref>.

Although there are many types of predictive models from statistical learning where embeddings can be applied, recent empirical studies have consistently shown that ridge regression achieves state-of-the-art results when using contextual embeddings <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Ganesan et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Matero et al., 2021</ref>; O.N.E. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Kjell et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr">)</ref>. Tenfold cross-validation was used for model training. The dataset was split into a training set (90%) and a test set (10%). Within the training set, an analysis set was used for developing models with various penalties, and an assessment set was utilized to evaluate these penalties and select the optimal model for the testing set (for details, see O.N.E. <ref type="bibr">Kjell et al., 2023)</ref>. The search grid in the ridge regression covered the range of 10 -16 -10 16 with increases of times 10. The training sets were stratified into groups based on the outcome (y) using 4 bins. Pearson correlation between the observed and language-assessed scores is used to assess the accuracy. Appendix SA5 lists additional R packages involved.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Significance testing the assessment accuracy of models</head><p>To compare the errors of two prediction models, we compute the error for each prediction (i.e., y -), and then use a paired sample t-test to examine whether the errors significantly differ. ๐ฆ</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Standardised difference scores</head><p>To assess a form of discriminant validity of the different response formats, we evaluate their ability to converge with difference scores between rating scales. This is done by training word embeddings to evaluate the difference scores. The difference scores are computed by subtracting one normalized score from another (where the normalisation includes subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation). For example, a positive score from taking the normalized PHQ-9 score minus the normalized GAD-7 score, indicates greater depressive symptoms relative to anxiety symptoms. This method allows us to determine how well the embeddings capture the distinctions (the relative difference) between these related constructs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Diversity index</head><p>To quantify the information in responses, we used Shannon Entropy <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Shannon, 1948)</ref>. This measure is important in machine learning, as it indicates how much information the algorithms have at their disposal to learn from. In this article, we use the Diversity index, which quantifies the entropy or diversity in a set of values or probabilistic events, which is here the possible responses on a rating scale or a word-based response). Mathematically, the Diversity Index is computed as 2 entropy , where entropy is calculated as the Shannon entropy:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">H = -โx p(x) log(p(x))</formula><p>, where p is its probability mass function, and x is a set of values or probabilistic events.</p></div>

Rating scales' reliability can be seen as a theoretical upper limit <ref type="bibr">(Muchinsky, 1996)</ref> for assessment accuracy, which is here measured as the mean of the item-total correlation and the test-retest reliability. The language-based assessments converge with the PHQ-9 with a correlation of .78, which is close to its reliability (r = .79); and converges with the CES-D with a correlation of .83, which is higher than the scales' reliability (r = .78). Further, the language-based assessments converge with the GAD-7 with a correlation of .77, which is .05 lower than its reliability (r = .82), and converge with the PSWQ with a correlation of .74, which is .06 lower than its reliability (r = .80).

In fact, the select format yields significantly lower errors than the write words (t = -5.00, p &lt; .001), phrases (t = -4.11, p &lt; .001), and texts (t = -3.70, p &lt; .001). For worry, select words (r = .67 for GAD-7) and the write words (r = .67) formats performed the most accurately, followed by the write phrases (r = .62) and texts (r = .59) formats. Also, the select words format yields significantly lower errors than the write phrases (t = -3.61, p &lt; .001) and texts (t = -4.37, p &lt; .001) formats, but not than the write words (t = -.57, p = .566) format.</p><p>Notably, the language responses tend to show a consistent specificity across all the response format predictions, so depression language tends to assess depression rating scales more accurately than the anxiety/worry scales, and worry language assess the anxiety/worry rating scales more accurately than the depression rating scales. Notes. N = 963. All correlations were significant at p &lt; .001. PHQ-9 = Patient Health Questionnaire-9 assessing depression; CES-D = The Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D); GAD-7 = Generalized Anxiety Disorder -7; PSWQ = Penn State Worry Questionnaire.

For worry, combining all four formats yields the strongest correlation to the anxiety rating scales (r = .71-.74), whereas for depression, combining only the select words and the write text formats yields a stronger correlation to depression rating scales (r = .77-.81) than using all four formats (r = .76). Further, combining both response formats and construct questions improves the assessment accuracy further, as demonstrated when using all eight response formats, which produces the highest correlations (significance testing the errors for 4 [construct congruent models, where, e.g., depression language predict depression scales] versus 8 response format yields significant differences for the PHQ-9: t = 2.26, p = .024; the CES-D: t = 2.73, p = .006; the GAD-7: t = 4.22, p &lt; .001; and the PSWQ: t = 4.14, p &lt; .001. Significance testing the errors for 4 versus the 2 best formats yield significant differences for the CES-D (t = 2.39, p = .017), the GAD-7 (t = 4.86, p &lt; .001), but not for the PHQ-9 (t = -.98, p = .326) and the PSWQ (t = 1.24, p = .215).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Concurrent validity across sample sizes</head><p>Assessing concurrent validity across sample sizes shows how much data is necessary to achieve reliable and accurate model performance in clinical assessments. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a-d</ref> shows the concurrent accuracy achieved by models trained on different sample sizes. Overall, the models based on the select words format, including the models based on 4 and all 8 response formats, reach a high convergent accuracy at around 100 participants (although with more participants, the accuracy increases and the error bars, of course, reduce). The writing-based formats require some more training examples than the select words format before reaching a more stable performance estimate; after 100 participants, all models are within ยฑ.24 of the performance estimate based on all participants; after 300 participants, all models are within ยฑ.09; after 500 participants, all models are within ยฑ.05; and after 700 participants all models are within ยฑ.03. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Face validity: Visualizations of the language predictive of depression and anxiety</head><p>Plotting statistically significant word responses according to rating scales shows words related to low versus high scores (Figure <ref type="figure">3a-d</ref>). For all word plots, high levels of mental health are described with words such as happy, glad, and blessed -whereas high levels of depression tend to be described with words such as sad and blue, and worry with words such as anxious, worried, and stress. The select words format yields a more constrained descriptive representation (fewer statistically significant words) compared to the more open response formats. It is also noticeable that word plots based on text responses demonstrate more function words. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discriminant validity</head><p>Whereas models based on several response formats tend to yield the strongest correlations to a targeted rating scale (Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">2,</ref><ref type="table" target="#tab_4">3</ref>, S11), the model prediction scores of different rating scales yield extremely strong correlations (Table <ref type="table">4</ref>). For example, the correlations between the predictions of the depression rating scale the PHQ-9, and the predictions of the anxiety rating scale the GAD-7, based on all eight response formats correlate with r = .93, whereas when based on single response formats, the predictions only correlate with r = .51 -.65; this may indicate poor discriminant validity. Hence, using responses from more formats when training the model increases the assessment accuracy, which may be at the cost of discriminant validity.</p><p>Developing models assessing the difference score. Although using multiple response formats appears to yield predictions with lower discriminant validity (i.e., strong inter-correlations), it is possible to create models predicting the normalized difference score between rating scales more accurately with multiple, as compared with single response formats (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">5</ref>; Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">S3</ref>). With all eight formats, it is possible to assess the difference score of the PHQ-9 and the GAD-7 with a correlation of r = .38, whereas only using a single response format for one construct yields accuracies ranging from r = .07 to .20 (single responses in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">S3</ref>).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Test-retest reliability</head><p>The test-retest reliability over two weeks was moderate to strong for the pre-registered models in the prospective dataset (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">7</ref>). The correlation for assessing depression from depression prompts with single formats was r = .66 -.75, and for assessing worry/anxiety from worry prompts was r = .52 -.62, whereas the reliability for the rating scales was all very strong (r = .85 -.89).  <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">S10</ref>.</p><p>External validity in the prospective sample: Pre-registered model assessments correlate with self-reported sick-leave and healthcare visits Most response formats yield assessment scores that are weakly to moderately correlated with clinically relevant external criteria related to mental health, including sick leave over the last three months (r = .18 -.28) and the last year (r = .17 -.29), as well as healthcare visits over the last year (r = .18 -.34; Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">8</ref>). There is a similar pattern for sick-leave and healthcare visits not specifically related to mental health issues (Table <ref type="table">S4</ref>). The write text format tended to yield stronger correlations than select words, write words, and write phrases in all but one instance (although the differences tended to be non-significant); this is even though these latter formats tend to be more accurate in predicting rating scales than the write text response format. Further, language-based predictions of the rating scales based on the write text format tend to show slightly higher correlations with the external criteria than the actual observed scores (e.g., self-reported sick leave due to mental health over the last year yields a correlation of r = .26 with the language-based assessments of CES-D, and only a correlation of r = .23 with the observed CES-D). In short, among the language-based response formats, the write text format tends to yield the strongest (or on par with the strongest) correlation to the mental health-related criteria (22 of 24 cases; Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">8</ref>) and the general health-related criteria (16 of 24, Table <ref type="table">S4</ref>). Compared to the observed rating scales, the language-based assessments exhibit an equal or stronger correlation to the externally related criteria of mental health in 9 of 12 cases (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">8</ref>) and for general health in 11 of 12 cases (Table <ref type="table">S4</ref>).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>The present study evaluated several validity and reliability aspects of language-based response formats ranging from more closed-ended to open-ended, using the Sequential Evaluation with Model Pre-registration (SEMP) design. Overall, the language-based assessments yielded high validity against self-reported rating scales and self-reported external criteria, and moderate to strong reliability, where the different response formats come with different strengths and weaknesses. For example, in the prospective sample, the pre-registered models demonstrated high concurrent validity with depression and worry/anxiety rating scales, which all performed above the pre-registered cut-off. The select words format tended to yield the highest assessment accuracy to rating scales, closely followed by the other formats. These findings align with previous research on the utility of natural language in capturing subjective experiences (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Kjell et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr">K. Kjell et al., 2021)</ref>, emphasizing its potential to complement traditional methods assessing depression/worry in clinical settings. The results demonstrate that both simple, select-based formats and more elaborate, open-ended text responses can achieve high levels of accuracy, highlighting their viability for diverse clinical and research applications, ranging from rapid assessments in time-constrained settings to in-depth evaluations for diagnostic purposes.</p><p>Further, the open-ended response formats showed incremental validity. When combined, they yielded predictive accuracies of rating scales, often approaching the rating scales' own reliability.</p><p>Combining the eight response formats typically exhibited superior performance, followed by four formats, two formats, and lastly, one response format. These findings highlight the value of integrating diverse response types to achieve a more robust assessment of these mental health constructs compared to relying on a single format.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Challenges and possibilities in discriminating constructs</head><p>Language-based assessments based on responses from different construct questions yield lower correlations between depression and anxiety than rating scales (language-based assessments: r = .51-.65, versus rating scales: .64-.85). However, using the same responses (i.e., from the same construct question(s)) for assessing the two different constructs produces scores that correlate very to extremely strongly (mean r = .92, range .88 -.95), indicating poor discriminant validity between depression and anxiety. Hence, although the models with the same language responses as input produce the highest assessment accuracy, it appears to be at the expense of discriminant validity. This is likely due to the shared variance in the data, where using the same language to assess a construct can be compared with attempting to assess two different constructs using the same item responses from one rating scale. Hence, future language-based assessment models should minimise shared variance by assessing distinct constructs through separate questions and responses (as is done in current practices with different rating scales), while exercising caution when using the same language responses for assessing multiple constructs.</p><p>Interestingly, though, it is possible to develop models that differentiate constructs by assessing the standardised difference scores of the rating scales. Hence, research could explore whether these discriminative models can provide insights that enhance treatment planning, such as enabling the offering of more precise and tailored interventions. Improved differentiation has the potential to enable clinicians to better tailor interventions to target the underlying problems. Distinguishing between depression and anxiety is particularly important given their overlapping symptoms and co-occurrence. By identifying distinct language markers for each condition, as highlighted by <ref type="bibr">Stade et al. (2023)</ref>, models can improve diagnostic accuracy and guide targeted therapeutic approaches. Furthermore, distinguishing between constructs can enhance symptom monitoring in longitudinal tracking, potentially allowing for a more precise understanding of symptom changes and ensuring timely and appropriate adjustments to treatment plans.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Converging with external criteria</head><p>The pre-registered models showed external validity to self-reported sick-leave and healthcare visits. A large body of research shows that depression and anxiety are related to sick leave (for a systematic reviews see <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Amiri et al., 2021</ref>; for a longitudinal study see <ref type="bibr">Sandi et al., 2021</ref> and for a clinical trial see <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bjรธrkedal et al., 2023)</ref> and healthcare visits <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Cicek et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Keller et al., 2018)</ref> providing support for the external validity of our measures. Interestingly, the write text format tended to yield the strongest correlations, which were in 9 of 12 cases actually slightly higher or equal to the correlation of observed rating scale scores. Notably, though, all three external validity measures were skewed with a median response of 0 in the current sample. This zero inflation could impact the interpretation of relationships, potentially masking the correlational strength, particularly in the non-zero portion of the sample.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Face validity and the interpretive power of open-ended responses</head><p>The language-based assessments can describe respondents' answers with statistically significant words across dimensions such as low to high rating scale scores. At the individual response level, the face validity of open-ended language can reveal whether a respondent has taken the task seriously (e.g., not entering random characters to fill a text box) and whether they have understood the questions (e.g., using "Yes" or "No" instead of providing descriptive answers). This capacity for nuanced evaluation is particularly advantageous compared to closed-ended formats, where insincere responses or misinterpretations of questions or instructions may be much harder to detect. The potential of evaluating the face validity of language responses could become an important aspect in clinical practice, where it can be more straightforward to identify cases in which an individual has not answered the assessment sincerely and diligently, thereby enabling timely intervention or clarification. These insights are harder to detect in closed-ended responses (although one can look for unusual response patterns).</p><p>At the group level, visualising open-ended language responses provides a unique source for examining the face and content validity of responses. For example, in all four response formats, respondents described their depression with words such as blue, depressed, and emptiness, and their anxiety with words such as nervous, and panic -which is according to the DSM-V criteria ("depressed mood", "diminished interest or pleasure" for major depressive disorder, and "excessive anxiety and worry" and "difficult to control the worry" for generalised anxiety disorder; American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Notably, the more open-ended response formats (i.e., texts, phrases, and words rather than select words) revealed more significant words. Further, the write words and phrases formats tended to contain fewer function words and more content words than the text format. Depending on how important describing individuals' responses is, these aspects may be important to consider.</p><p>Further, as demonstrated in previous research <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Kjell et al., 2021)</ref> and highlighted in our supplementary material, open-ended responses of depression and anxiety frequently include references to "pain," "pains," and "painful" (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">S13</ref>), which tend to be significantly related to higher rating scale scores. This, further underscore the potential of language-based assessments to capture aspects of mental health beyond closed-ended rating scales. Hence, the richer insights provided by more open-ended formats (e.g., texts, phrases, and words) highlight their ability to more comprehensively capture symptoms, which can be valuable in research and clinical settings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Test-retest reliability and sensitivity to change</head><p>The pre-registered models demonstrated moderate to strong test-retest reliability across two weeks, whereas the rating scales' test-retest reliability was very strong. This difference highlights a trade-off between the very strong consistency of closed-ended methods and the higher flexibility of language-based approaches. The lower reliability of language-based assessments might be due to several reasons: First, open-ended language responses have a larger range, openness, and dimensionality than closed-ended rating scale responses (O.N.E. <ref type="bibr">Kjell et al., 2024)</ref>, which enables them to vary more. Second, the very strong test-retest reliability of rating scales might reflect a lack of sensitivity to change, whereas the moderate to strong test-retest of language-based assessments potentially reflects actual changes in depression and anxiety over two weeks; in other words, it could be that language-based assessments may be more equipped to capture changes. While high test-retest reliability is generally desirable as it indicates consistency, there is a point at which it can signal that a mental health assessment is not sensitive enough to detect changes in a person's condition, lacks nuance in capturing the complexity of symptoms, or both. Detecting changes in symptoms is particularly important in both research and clinical practice, especially during the course of therapy, as it informs treatment effectiveness and necessary adjustments. Future research should explore the utility of language-based assessments for repeated, longitudinal evaluations in clinical settings to determine their sensitivity and practicality in capturing meaningful symptom changes over time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Optimizing sample sizes for model accuracy</head><p>Understanding how model accuracy evolves with increasing training data size helps inform decisions about the minimum number of participants needed to develop robust assessments, while also showing whether current models perform as well as possible given the training sample size. Our results show clear differences in the data requirements for achieving good performance across response formats. This information can optimise resource allocation while ensuring the validity of assessment outcomes. Our results show that models based on the select words format achieve high accuracy with as few as 100 participants, while the writing-based formats require more examples to reach stable performance. As the number of participants increases beyond 500 to 700, all models begin to stabilize, with minimal further improvement in accuracy. This flattening suggests that increasing the sample size beyond this point would not substantially enhance model performance. This plateau indicates that some response formats, such as the select words format, are more efficient for training models on smaller datasets, making them particularly suitable for studies with limited resources. This insight can guide future resource allocation, allowing researchers to prioritize formats that achieve robust performance with fewer participants.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Balancing response time and information content</head><p>The response formats vary in response time. More open response formats require more time whilst having the highest ecological validity (i.e., being how we normally communicate complex psychological experiences). This trade-off between brevity and richness is an important consideration for tailoring assessments to specific contexts. The use of brief assessments is increasingly favored in various research settings; for example, in extensive online surveys where participants may lack the endurance for lengthy assessments, in longitudinal studies involving repeated measures over time, and in initial screenings aimed at rapidly identifying specific characteristics or conditions prior to admitting participants into a comprehensive study (e.g., see <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Sandy et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p>The diversity index could explain the increased accuracy of combining response formats in assessment. In general, combining response formats yields higher self-information (a higher diversity index) -and combining more response formats yields higher assessment accuracy. However, whereas the select words format yields the strongest assessment accuracy, it has the lowest diversity index. This might be explained by how the words were selected to be the most frequent answers from a previous study (O.N.E. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Kjell et al., 2019)</ref>. So, the information seems to have been optimized to capture the variance in the rating scale -but it might not be as good in other related outcomes, such as what is seen in their correlation to external criteria, including self-reported sick-leave and health visits; this requires further research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Clinical relevance and applications in practice</head><p>Considering that language comprises higher range, resolution, dimensionality, openness and information content than rating scales (O.N.E. <ref type="bibr">Kjell et al., 2024)</ref>, it has the potential to be more accurate in converging with important clinically relevant behaviours (i.e. external validity), and thus capturing more variance with signs and symptoms. Effectively getting this information extracted with standardised tools is still an ongoing effort, and particularly few works have explored different natural language response formats.</p><p>The results from our study indicate that language-based assessments can provide accurate severity scores for depression and anxiety as well as clinically meaningful descriptions. The severity scores from language-based assessments moderately to strongly converge with rating scales, and the write text format showed similar or even higher external validity compared to self-reports for the criterion variables. However, the write text format is also the most time-intensive. Its use may therefore be more suitable in contexts where a comprehensive understanding of the patient's mental health is essential, such as during intake or diagnostic evaluations. Conversely, faster formats like select or write descriptive words are more practical in time-constrained settings or when frequent repeated assessments are required.</p><p>Beyond the severity scores, the open-ended response formats also comprise an individual's unique descriptions of symptoms (e.g., I feel overwhelmed) and experiences (e.g., I'm avoiding talking to others because my emotions are unpredictable and I worry that the mask might slip). These descriptions can be presented to clinicians to support them in reaching a thorough understanding of a patient's condition during, for example, screening, intake or follow-up. The descriptions can also help clinicians identify specific areas or topics to explore in therapy, such as addressing expressed emotions, or concerns. By providing a detailed and personalized picture of a patient's mental state, these insights can guide the planning of therapy sessions, ensuring that the topics addressed are tailored to the patient's unique experiences and needs. Hence, language-based assessments can support person-centered care by providing comprehensive, person-centered insights into their mental health, aligning with the aim of prioritizing individuals' values, needs and preferences in care planning (American Geriatrics Society Expert Panel, 2015). Additionally, in the course of treatment, these descriptions can be shared with patients to help them reflect on and better understand the trajectory of their mental health <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Folkersma et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Morris et al., 2010)</ref>. The potential therapeutic utility of this approach warrants further research.</p><p>The different characteristics of the response formats further increase the clinical relevance of language-based assessments by offering different clinical applications. In clinical situations with time constraints, clinicians might prioritise faster response formats, such as the select or write descriptive words formats, where respondents complete the former faster than the corresponding rating scales. In situations where accuracy and a thorough understanding of the patients are crucial, combining response formats, such as using the select words and the write text formats.</p><p>The select words format offers a quick and accurate option, and combining it with the write text format provides incremental validity and a deeper, more personal assessment, with higher chance of uncovering unique complex experiences. Further, when differentiating between mental illnesses is essential, it is important to use different language questions in the assessments (like one uses different rating scales to assess depression versus anxiety) or use a model trained to yield a difference score.</p><p>Language-based assessments support and align with the digital transformation of healthcare <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Warraich et al., 2018)</ref>. Patients could, for example, be invited online to complete a survey where they openly describe their mental health before a meeting, which will not take time from the clinician's work, and it can allow the clinician to prepare the session by reviewing both a severity score and a personal description of the patient's unique experiences and symptoms. Additionally, language-based assessment can be clinically valuable in app-based interventions <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bakker et al., 2016)</ref>, where patients gain insights into their longitudinal time. Such insights may empower patients to better understand their unique experiences and mental health patterns and progress, fostering engagement and self-management. Further, the time spent on describing one's mental health can potentially be seen as a type of expressive writing intervention in itself, leading to improved health (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Lepore, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Lepore et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Pennebaker &amp; Beall., 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Smyth, 1998)</ref>; however, to what extent this is the case for our specific open-ended measures requires future research. Future studies could investigate whether the therapeutic effects of expressive writing extend to these open-ended formats, enhancing their dual value as both assessment tools and interventions. Future research could also aim to disentangle this potential effect when evaluating therapeutic interventions, as it is important to distinguish the benefits derived specifically from the intervention itself versus those potentially arising from the act of completing the open-ended assessment.</p><p>Lastly, evaluating and visualising the language patterns driving language-based assessment models-such as through word figures-can provide valuable insights into how AI interprets and assesses depression or anxiety severity from language. These insights can be particularly valuable in clinical settings, such as diagnostic evaluations, where understanding the linguistic markers of mental health can support clinicians in identifying key symptoms. Additionally, in research contexts, these visualisations can help elucidate the psychological mechanisms underlying these disorders, providing a deeper understanding of the relationship between language use and mental health.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations and Directions for Future Research</head><p>Language-based assessments, like rating scales, are not objective truths of psychological constructs. Like research developing stronger rating scales, our work evaluates approaches to using language-based assessments that meet more criteria of validity and reliability to get closer to latent true scores. However, more extensive evaluations are available and should be done to further establish their validity and reliability such as their ability to converge with best-estimate assessments (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Eijsbroek et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Spitzer, 1983)</ref> as well as construct relevant observable (i.e., not only self-reported) behaviours.</p><p>Our results focus on overall accuracy metrics rather than metrics for individual preferences toward specific response formats. There also could be systematic individual differences, where certain individuals may express themselves better with certain response formats -or situational factors influencing the accuracy of the response formats differently. Future research could, for example, examine whether accuracy errors are related to personality traits, educational level, language skill levels, and so on and whether accuracy errors differ across different settings/contexts. Our work lays a foundation informing which response formats seem to work best on average and thus could be built on for work pursuing personalized response formats</p><p>The study also has methodological limitations.</p><p>The questions enabling open-ended responses were presented before the list of words and closed-ended rating scales. We implemented this order to avoid the predefined word lists and items to influence respondents' open-ended answers. However, one possibility is that the open-ended language responses may have introduced priming effects (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Mohan et al., 2016)</ref> influencing how they answer the rating scale items.</p><p>Hence, this priming effect may overestimate the correlation estimate. Future studies should consider randomising the order of open-ended formats and rating scales to disentangle the effects of question order.</p><p>Moreover, since this study includes only online samples, caution is advised when generalising the findings beyond this population and context. Future studies should include diverse clinical populations to enhance the generalizability and applicability of language-based assessments in clinical settings. For instance, incorporating participants from outpatient and inpatient clinics, as well as individuals from different cultural and socioeconomic backgrounds, could provide deeper insights into the robustness and validity of these assessments. Additionally, longitudinal studies in clinical contexts could help establish their utility for monitoring treatment progress and outcomes. Further, language-based assessments need to be validated in specific populations and contexts as well as follow relevant regulations (e.g., see the AI act <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[Hauglid &amp;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Mahler, 2023, and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Veale &amp;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Zuiderveen Borgesius, 2021]</ref>, and the CE-mark in the EU <ref type="bibr">[European Commission, 2023]</ref>).</p><p>Last, the current large language model was not explicitly trained for mental health assessment tasks; future research could examine whether finetuning the models may increase the assessment accuracy even further. However, fine-tuning large language models typically requires substantial amounts of data. Preliminary results from our merged dataset, encompassing over 15,000 probed language responses from multiple studies, have not yielded significant gains in accuracy. These findings, combined with the high accuracies achieved in the current study, suggest that RoBERTa-large demonstrates strong generalization capabilities to mental health language without fine-tuning it. Future research could also explore whether greater accuracy can be achieved using other large language models and different predictive model frameworks. Box 1 demonstrates R-code, exemplifying how the registered language models can be applied in future research using the text package (O.N.E. <ref type="bibr">Kjell et al., 2023</ref>; see Supplement Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">S6</ref> for a list of pre-registered models available for automatic download). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>The results provide strong evidence demonstrating concurrent, incremental, discriminant, face, and external validity of the different response formats. Using the Sequential Evaluation and Model Pre-registration design, we find that the pre-registered models produce robust prospective sample reliability and test-retest reliability. We show how the response formats differ in, for example, accuracy, visualizations, time burden, and information content. The select response format exhibited superior performance across a range of metrics, including assessment accuracy and response time -however, a list of words is not the natural way of communicating complex psychological phenomena; it produces constrained visualizations and less external validity than text responses. If high accuracy matters, combining the select words and write text formats could be an option. The overall high validity and reliability across the response formats provide the possibility to choose formats according to different research and clinical needs varying in accuracy requirements, time constraints, and response openness.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Information content across response formats</head><p>The response formats differ in the information content they capture (Table <ref type="table">9</ref>). The write phrases format yields the highest information content (Diversity Index = 561.0 for depression and 532.2 for anxiety), whereas the select words format has the lowest (Diversity Index = 23.7 for depression and 26.4 for anxiety). It is noteworthy that the information content of rating scale responses is smaller than that from the responses of open-ended formats (the write words, texts, and phrases formats) but larger than the select words format. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Time burden: The time taken to complete each response format</head><p>The survey design enabled us to measure the response time describing both constructs for each response format. Response times with a Z-score of ยฑ3.29 were set to the value corresponding to that Z-score 4 . The median completion time of the select words format for both depression and worry (Median = 61 sec.) was significantly smaller than the aggregated completion time of the PHQ-9 and the GAD-7 (Median = 85 sec., t = -14.05, p &lt; .001) and the CES-D and PSWQ (Median = 135 sec., t = -36.59, p &lt; .001). The second to fastest natural language response format was the write words (Median = 134 sec.), followed by the write phrases (Median = 159 sec.), and last, the write text format (Median = 243 sec.). The response time for the response formats varies widely, where the write text format, on average, takes more than four times as long as the select words format.</p></div>			</div>
