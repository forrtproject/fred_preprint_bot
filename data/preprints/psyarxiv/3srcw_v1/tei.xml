<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Studies on video games and well-being often rely on self-report measures or data from a single game. Here, we study how 703 US adults' time spent playing for over 140,000 hours across 150 Nintendo Switch games relates to their life satisfaction, affect, depressive symptoms, and general mental well-being. We replicate previous findings that playtime over the past two weeks does not predict well-being, and extend these findings to a wider range of timescales (one hour to one year). Results suggest that relationships, if present, dissipate within two hours of gameplay. Our non-causal findings suggest substantial confounding would be needed to shift a meaningful true effect to the observed null. Although playtime was not related to well-being, players' assessments of the value of game time-so called gaming life fit-was. Results emphasise the importance of defining the gaming population of interest, collecting data from more than one game, and focusing on how players integrate gaming into their lives rather than the amount of time spent.</p></div>

Although there is increasing recognition that not all 18 screentime-or in the case of games, playtime-is created 19 equal <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Orben, 2022)</ref>, it remains a major research focus.

News media suggest time-based limits 37 (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Saveva, 2023)</ref>, often referencing the since-abandoned 2x2 rule from the American Academy of Pediatrics: no screen time for children under two, and no more than two hours per day for children older than two <ref type="bibr">(Blum-Ross &amp; Livingstone, 2018)</ref>. Likewise, the American Psychiatric Association's description of Internet Gaming Disorder characterises pathological engagement with games, in part, as involving '8-10 hours or more per day [and or] least 30 hours per week' (American Psychiatric <ref type="bibr">Association, 2013, p. 796)</ref>. On a larger scale, time-based limits such as Korea's 10-year Youth Protection Revision Act prohibited young people from playing games between 00:00 and 06:00 <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Sang et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p>More recently, China put in place a weekly three-hour limit for under-18s <ref type="bibr">(Feiner &amp; Kharpal, 2021)</ref>.

Given that play takes many forms and happens across many different games, researchers greatly benefit from access to digital trace data-histories of user actions generated when interacting with technologies such as a game or online platform. Digital trace data can provide much greater detail about what, when, and how much people play than is possible in self-report data, which consistently shows substantial discrepancies compared to digital trace data collected by online platforms <ref type="bibr">(Ernala et al., 2020)</ref> and independent researchers <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Parry et al., 2021)</ref> alike.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures</head><p>Participants completed a self-report survey that took on average 22 minutes to complete. The survey included background factors such as demographics and life circumstances, a series of cognitive tasks, as well as self-report measures of time use, and motivations for video game play. We detail those measures we used in this study below but all study data are available at OSF (see supplementary materials).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Video game playtime was measured by collecting a record</head><p>of each player's individual game sessions for all 1st party video games played on a Nintendo Switch. These data were provided by Nintendo of America. Playtime was calculated by summing the duration of all (partial) sessions that occur during a given time period relative to the participant's survey response, based on the logged session start and end times. For ease of interpretation, game play time in all observation periods longer 24 hours is reported as mean minutes of play per day. It is important to note that these data included only telemetry for games published by Nintendo and its close business partners (e.g. The Pokémon Company), but not games made by third party publishers (e.g. Electronic Arts). Nintendo-published games accounted for 63% of all playtime across our sample; the 37% of play data from 3rdparty games is therefore treated as missing. We return to this limitation in the discussion.</p><p>General mental well-being was measured with the WEMWBS <ref type="bibr">(Tennant et al., 2007)</ref>. Players rated 14 statements about how they felt during the past 2 weeks such as "I've been dealing with problems well" and "I've been feeling good about myself" on a 5-point scale from 1 ("none of the time") to 5 ("all of the time"). Scores were calculated by taking the mean of all items.</p><p>Depressive symptoms was measured with the PROMIS Short Form 8a <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Pilkonis et al., 2011)</ref>.

Scores were 246 calculated by taking the mean of all items. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Smallest Effect Size of Interest</head><p>We Note: this method of specifying an SESOI is predicated on a causal interpretation-it implicitly imagines a world where one can intervene on playtime (our predictor) and have an effect of a certain size on mental health (our outcomes). It is very unlikely that our cross-sectional analyses can provide unbiased causal estimates. Instead, our goal is to use associations to place boundaries on the size of a possible effect.</p><p>In other words, if there is no meaningful correlation between 316 playtime and mental health, there is even less likely to be a 317 meaningful causal effect between playtime and mental health.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Exploratory analysis: Moderation by life fit</head><p>Next, we conducted exploratory analyses to investigate what other factors might influence who exhibits positive or negative relations between gaming and well-being. We explored age, gender, and life fit-the perceived harmful or beneficial value of gaming across various life domains outside of play.

While the current study is unlikely to generalize to so-called "hardcore" players who play several hours per day or more and therefore may experience more accumulative effects, our findings align with previous studies of more highly engaged players and add a new subgroup of players to the body of work showing the absence of any meaningful relationship <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Ballou et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr">Larrieu et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Vuorre et al., 2022)</ref>.</p><p>As the field progresses, however, differences in the level of engagement pose major challenges for study sampling and generalisability. Calls for representative samples need to specify the population of reference: should this be the general population (of whom many do not play games), people who play any games at all (of whom many do not play the games for which researchers have data access), people who play the particular game or platform of interest (of whom many may be only minimally engaged), or something else entirely? In the field's quest for more generalizable results, this will be a critical issue.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Timescales</head><p>While we are quick to caution that this is a preliminary finding that should not be relied upon without further validation, our data provide some initial evidence that effects of raw playtime might materialize and fade within a few hourspoint estimates indicated that playtime was more strongly linked with greater well-being in the 1-2 hours prior to survey completion. This finding is compatible with various causal explanations: for example, players who recently played are more likely be in a period of leisure time, which would be expected to generate more positive feelings than in peers doing obligatory activities such as work. However, if researchers do expect to see positive effects of gaming, our data suggest that they may need to search for highly proximal effects directly during and following a play session (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Vuorre et al., 2024)</ref>.</p><p>Should this finding be upheld, it would go a long way towards explaining previous null findings from studies that related well-being to playtime over timescales such as two weeks <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Vuorre et al., 2022)</ref>, one month <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Sibilla et al., 2021</ref><ref type="bibr">), six months (Weinstein et al., 2017)</ref>, and one year <ref type="bibr">(Kowert et al., 2015)</ref>.

(2020) used playtime and in-game behavior to identify subgroups of League of Legends players who had more negative in-game experiences. Johannes et al. (2021) look at playtime in Animal Crossing: New Horizons and PvZ: Battle for Neighborville and found a positive but likely negligible correlation. A follow-up study expanded this to seven games, finding that changes in playtime over the course of 6 weeks were unlikely to affect subsequent well-being (Vuorre et al., 2022). Larrieu et al. (2023) follow high-intensity Rainbow 6: Siege players and find no link between playtime and quality of life across any identified player types. 92 Though informative, this early work has a vital scope lim-93 itation: digital trace data was only available for a single game 94 for each player-participant. It was not possible to know what 95 other games a participant was, or was not, electing to play. 96 Players regularly switch between games over the course of a 97 day or week based on mood, available time, and social con-98 text (Ballou et al., 2024; O'Neill et al., 2016); data collected 99 for one particular game may thus tell us little about overall 100 playtime or its relation to well-being. 101 An important frontier for the field, therefore, is to col-102 lect holistic digital trace data that reflects behavior in not just 103 one game, but all games played (which may include various 104 games on one platform, such as Nintendo Switch or Steam, or 105 all games played across several platforms a player uses). At 106 present, our understanding of even basic phenomena such as 107 the true volume of play in different demographics rely on the 108 same inaccurate self-report data, itself often provided by mar-109 ket research firms using opaque methodologies.

We first distributed a screening questionnaire to 163 7649 participants asking which video game platforms they 164 were active on; of these, 4184 indicated that they played 165 games on Nintendo Switch. 166 We invited these participants to a second survey wherein 167 they retrieved an account identifier from the Nintendo web 168 interface using the events QR code, available at https:// 169 accounts.nintendo.com/qrcode, and they shared these unique 170 identifiers with us.

Participants were 249 prompted with 'Please imagine a ladder with steps numbered 250 from 0 at the bottom to 10 at the top. The top of the ladder 251 represents the best possible life for you, and the bottom of the 252 ladder represents the worst possible life for you. On which 253 step of the ladder would you say you personally feel you stood 254 over the past two weeks?'. Participants responded on a scale 255 from 0 to 10, which was rescaled to 1-5 to match the other 256 well-being measures. 257 Affect was measured with a single item: "How are you 258 feeling right now?" (Killingsworth &amp; Gilbert, 2010). Par-259 ticipants responded using a 100-point visual analogue scale 260 (VAS) with endpoints "Very bad" and "Very good", which 261 we rescaled to 1-5 to match the other well-being measures. 262 Gaming life fit was measured with a draft measure asking 263 players to rate the contribution of gaming to 5 life domains 264 (work/school, social participation, cognitive health, emotion 265 regulation, and daily routines) on a 7-pt bipolar scale from 266 "greatly interfered" to "greatly supported". We took the aver-267 age of these to generate a formative indicator of the degree to 268 which players perceive their gaming to be beneficial or harm-269 ful to other aspects of their lives. This measure has not been 270 used or validated before, and we return to this in the discus-, we fit multiple regression models with playtime 274 over the previous 2 weeks as the primary predictor, all de-275 mographic variables as covariates (age, gender, highest level 276 of education, and employment status), and the corresponding 277 mental health variable as the outcome. For example, for H1a 278 (life satisfaction predicted by the previous 2 weeks of play), 279 the model in R is: 280 {{lm((life satisfaction) ~(playtime in the previous 2 281 weeks) + age + gender + education + employment)}} 282 We apply a similar analysis approach to our exploration of 283 H2 concerning other timescales; we primarily apply multi-284 ple regression with well-being predicted by playtime aggre-285 gated over various time periods and the same covariates, but 286 also explore potential non-linear alternatives and moderation 287 analyses (detailed below). 288 We interpret the playtime coefficient estimates from these 289 models in reference to pre-specified smallest effect sizes of 290 interest (see below): if the 99% confidence interval is fully 291 within the upper and lower equivalence bounds, this provides 292 evidence to reject a practically meaningful association.</figDesc></figure>

Next, we reran the analyses using session durations as calculated by Nintendo, as opposed to the implied duration based on the start and end timestamps; Nintendo's durations are shorter than the implied duration in approximately 10% of sessions due to internal methodology. Data show a similar pattern:</figDesc></figure>

First, we could not analyse teleme-617 try generated when players engaged with third-party titles 618 (i.e. games not published by Nintendo or its closely associ-619 ated companies). As a result, our findings only hold for simi-620 lar Nintendo games (75% of which were rated for everyone or 621 everyone over 10), and it is not possible to rule out the possi-622 bility that third-party games with different content or themes 623 might show a different pattern of effects. Likewise, because 624 we collaborated with Nintendo of America, our sample con-625 sisted only of adults living in the United States, a group that 626 we found to be largely casually involved with first-party Nin-627 tendo games. Games are both global and played by those of 628 all ages, so it is not clear the degree to which our findings 629 do or do not apply to younger players, those who play other 630 games, or those who approach games from different cultural 631 and linguistic backgrounds. Finally, while we have longitudi-632 nal telemetry data, our self-report survey was cross-sectional 633 and this study is one step towards designs using daily diary 634 and experience sampling methods (Aalbers et al., 2021; e.g.,</figDesc></figure>
