<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Survival necessitates a delicate balance between expending effort to obtain resources, and energy conservation. Individual differences in motivation, the tendency to expend effort, play a fundamental role in society, affecting health, education, and economic outcomes. Previous theories explain variations in motivation via dopaminergic function. However, insulin resistance could also alter motivated behaviour by shifting the balance toward energy conservation. In a preregistered experiment, we investigated whether blunted motivational tendencyreduced tendency to exert effort, quantified using economic decision-making models, and previously linked to neuropsychiatric symptoms-is present in type-2 diabetes. We found subjects with type-2 diabetes showed this cognitive signature of blunted motivational tendency, compared to matched non-diabetic controls. Across a large sample with and without diabetes, we found that increasing risk for diabetes linearly predicted blunted motivational tendency. Diabetic patients treated with semaglutide did not show restored motivational tendency. Metabolic ill-health is associated with a shift towards energy conservation, potentially contributing to comorbidity between metabolic disease and mental illness.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Motivation underpins every facet of human behaviour. Higher motivation is associated with beeer outcomes across domains including academic performance, employment status, IQ score and life satisfaction 1 , while reduced motivation (variously termed anhedonia, apathy or avolition) is a key transdiagnostic symptom of neurological and psychiatric conditions including depression, schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease, and stroke 2 . Patients often describe reduced motivation as being among the most negative impacts on their quality of life <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> . Empirical work suggests a neurocognitive mechanism underpins motivational differences: the integration of costs and benefits during decision-making (effort-based decision-making) <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">4</ref> .</p><p>Growing evidence suggests that motivation and metabolic health are closely linked. Metabolic disorders like type-2 diabetes (T2D) are highly comorbid with neuropsychiatric disorders like depression or schizophrenia, and motivational symptoms are postulated to play a mediating role in the relationship <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">5</ref> . An overall shift towards greater energy conservation, manifesting partly as reduced effort expenditure or 'blunted motivational tendency', may constitute a common risk factor across mental and metabolic health. This suggests the existence of an overarching energy regulation phenotype spanning cognitive and physical health disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">6</ref> .</p><p>Motivation depends primarily on dopaminergic signalling in the brain, particularly projections from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) to the ventral striatum via the mesolimbic pathway 2 . In humans, dopamine D2/3 receptor availability has been shown to correlate with motivational tendency, and dopamine agonists may increase motivational tendency <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">7</ref> . Neurons along the mesolimbic pathway also express receptors for insulin. While the effects of insulin on the brain are complex, a main effect seems to be an increase in dopamine release <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">8</ref> . As well as enhancing motivation, striatal dopamine has a number of effects relevant to energy homeostasis, including inhibiting appetite and suppressing endogenous glucose production <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">9</ref> . By extension, insulin insensitivity could potentially disrupt motivation.</p><p>For instance, empirical work suggests the relationship between depression and blunted motivation is mediated by overweight status, possibly due to elevated rates of insulin resistance <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">10</ref> .</p><p>A common, effective treatment for diabetes and obesity is the glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) analogue semaglutide. Semaglutide works by augmenting insulin secretion and regulating appetite, but also affects the brain where, like insulin, it targets dopaminergic neurons in mesolimbic pathways <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">11</ref> .</p><p>It is unclear whether poor metabolic health, like mental and neurological health, is associated with blunted motivational tendency, and whether effective treatments work to ameliorate this blunting. We set out to investigate how a cognitive signature of motivational tendency is affected by metabolic disease and treatment, focussing on T2D and semaglutide. We hypothesised that people with T2D would exhibit blunted motivational tendencies and that this would be restored in patients undergoing semaglutide treatment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>We recruited four study groups, differing in metabolic health and medication status, but matched by age, gender, and physical activity: subjects with T2D taking semaglutide, subjects with T2D not taking semaglutide, non-diabetic control subjects matched on body mass index (BMI), and control subjects with low metabolic risk (including restricting BMI to between 18.5 and 25; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>). Participants completed a gamified effort-based decision-making task online <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">12</ref> , as well as self-report questionnaires targeting general health and neuropsychiatric symptoms (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>).</p><p>Using computational modelling, we quantified subject-level parameters governing participants' effort-based decision-making.</p><p>The four study groups did not differ in age, gender, physical activity, and, for the first three groups, BMI (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). Effort-discounting effects during the task were found in all groups (all p &lt; .001). To obtain subject-level parameter estimates describing participants' effort-based decision-making, we used hierarchical Bayesian modelling to fit six economic decision theory models to the task data (with weakly informative Gaussian priors and Markov-Chain Monte Carlo sampling, implemented in cmdstanr <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">13</ref> ). We checked all models for model convergence and chain mixing, using numeric diagnostics of ESS and split R-hats, and visual  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A cognitive signature of blunted motivational tendency in T2D subjects</head><p>In our preregistered analyses, we found a main effect of group on motivational tendency (F(3, 224) = 5.025, p = .002, h 2 = 0.063), such that non-diabetic, low-BMI controls had the highest drive to exert effort for rewards, and diabetic patients on semaglutide the lowest (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref>). Post-hoc comparisons show the group effect was driven by differences between the T2D group on semaglutide and both the  <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). Furthermore, our results were not driven by differences in neuropsychiatric symptoms -we found no group differences in neuropsychiatric questionnaire scores (apathy: F(3, 224) = 0.555, p = .645; anhedonia: F(3, 224) = 1.212, p = .306, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>An increasing risk for diabetes linearly predicts blunted motivational tendency</head><p>In an exploratory analysis, we tested the relationship between motivational tendency and metabolic risk score across study groups in a generalized linear model.</p><p>Metabolic risk significantly predicted motivational tendency (b = -0.129, t = -2.489, p = .014, h 2 = 0.027), with a higher metabolic risk score predicting a lower motivational tendency parameter. The effect of metabolic risk on motivational tendency remained significant when controlling for antidepressant use (b = -0.109, t = -2.011, p = .046, h 2 =.017).</p><p>In our sample of type-2 diabetic patients on semaglutide injections, time since semaglutide injection did not affect motivational decision-making (within-subjects comparison of one to six days since injection, n = 25: t(24) = 0.237, p = 0.814).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>In this study, we found that type-2 diabetes (T2D) is associated with altered effort-based decision-making. Specifically, participants with T2D exhibited a lower motivational tendency compared to non-diabetic controls. This main result was echoed by our finding that increased risk of diabetes is associated with decreased motivational tendency.</p><p>Our findings align with a broader framework regarding the brain's involvement in energy regulation. In T2D, reduced sensitivity to insulin could be conceptualised as shifting the body's homeostatic set point, favouring energy conservation over expenditure <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">15</ref> . Cognitively, this homeostatic shift corresponds to a shift away from effortful behaviour, potentially owing to alterations in dopamine signalling 2 .</p><p>The cross-sectional nature of this study means we cannot draw any conclusions about whether changes in motivation precede, or are a consequence of, T2D. However, an important implication of our results is the putative existence of a positive feedback loop: decreased motivational tendencies and a behavioural bias towards energy conservation could potentially inhibit behaviours such as physical exercise, leading to weight gain and the continued maintenance or progression of metabolic dysfunction.</p><p>As semaglutide's effects on weight loss are mediated by the brain, and through dopaminergic signalling in particular <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">11</ref> which in turn influences behaviour 2 , we had hypothesized semaglutide would enhance motivation. We were surprised, therefore, to find semaglutide did not significantly affect motivation -in fact, the T2D group on semaglutide had numerically (though not significantly) the lowest motivational tendency across all four groups. We consider two explanations for this result. First, it is possible that despite our group matching approach, sampling differences between T2D subjects on and off semaglutide resulted in systematic differences between the groups. For instance, participants who had been prescribed semaglutide may have had worse glucose control or metabolic health before semaglutide prescription, making them less comparable with our other groups. Note however, that groups were matched carefully on a number of variables including BMI. Alternatively, semaglutide may genuinely have no effect on motivational tendency in T2D. Further work, ideally a randomised controlled trial on the cognitive effects of semaglutide, will be needed to understand its effects on motivation fully.</p><p>Our study results should be seen in light of several limitations, the most important of which is that the cross-sectional nature of our study precludes any assessment of a causal relationship between metabolic health and motivation.</p><p>Longitudinal epidemiological studies suggest that T2D (or poor metabolic health more generally) and depression have a reciprocal relationship: the presence of either condition increases the risk of subsequently developing the other <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">17</ref> . In future, to beeer understand the possible role of altered cognition and motivational tendency in this bi-directional relationship, one could conduct a longitudinal study measuring motivational changes in effort-based decision-making over time and assess how this relates to metabolic health and risk for diabetes. Additionally, studying changes in effort-based decision-making as T2D patients undergo treatment could also offer valuable insights to the causal relationship between T2D and motivation. Our results indicate this is a promising area of study.</p><p>Conducting our study online allowed us to access a much larger and more diverse participant population than we could have obtained in person. However, a corollary of this study setup is that we are unable to obtain physiological measures from our participants, limiting us in our ability to infer underlying biological mechanisms. A laboratory experiment taking quantitative measures of metabolic health, such as insulin sensitivity, would be a useful complement to our current study. Based on the results presented here, we would predict participants with poorer insulin sensitivity to show a corresponding shift in motivational tendency.</p><p>In summary, we have identified a cognitive signature of diabetes, reduced motivational tendency, which may play a part in maintaining or worsening disease progression. The reduced motivational tendency in T2D may result from central insulin insensitivity affecting the dopaminergic reward and motivation pathways.</p><p>This may be part of a broader mechanism of energy regulation, underlying the comorbidity between metabolic disease and mental illness.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental design</head><p>The objective of this study was to investigate whether diabetes and risk of diabetes were associated with changes in effort-based decision-making, and additionally, whether these changes were altered by ongoing treatment with the GLP-1 agonist semaglutide. The design we employed was a between-subjects online experiment, measuring effort-based decision-making with a gamified online task (see below) combined with computational models of decision-making, and additional self-report questionnaires.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pre-registration and open data</head><p>The pre-registration for this study can be found at heps://osf.io/7kmf5. The study was approved by the University of Cambridge Psychology Research Ethics Commieee (PRE.2022.078), and all participants provided informed consent. The analysis code and data are openly available at heps://github.com/smehrhof/semaglutide-study. The effort-expenditure task code is available at heps://github.com/smehrhof/effort-study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Recruitment and data acquisition</head><p>All data was collected on Prolific 18 in the United States and the United Kingdom. All participants provided informed consent through an online form, complying with the University of Cambridge Human Biology Research Ethics Commieee procedures for online studies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study groups with type-2 diabetes</head><p>To identify participants meeting criteria for the study groups of patients with T2D, we implemented a screening procedure. The screening included demographic variables (age, gender, ethnicity, socio-economic status (SES), income, and English proficiency), general health (neurological conditions, mental health/neurodevelopmental conditions, chronic disease, and daily medication), current GLP-1 agonist treatment status, metabolic-related health (current height and weight for BMI calculation, current desire for weight-loss and weight-loss interventions, other current treatments for diabetes), and physical activity using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire -short form (IPAQ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">19</ref> . Prolific prescreeners were used to restrict recruitment to participants with T2D.</p><p>Participants reporting to be on GLP-1 agonist treatment with weekly injections of semaglutide (i.e., Ozempic or Wegovy) for at least 4 weeks fulfilled criteria to be included in the T2D, on semaglutide group and were invited to the main testing. Subjects indicating they are not currently (nor have ever been) on any form of GLP-1 agonist treatment were matched to the T2D, on semaglutide group by age, gender, BMI, and IPAQ. The matched subset was then invited to the main testing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study groups of healthy controls</head><p>To obtain healthy control (HC) groups of subjects without diabetes, we used a pre-existing general population dataset derived from a previous study, which implemented a largely overlapping study procedure <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">12</ref> . Participants without diabetes and off any GLP-1 agonist treatment were identified as possible HC. For the first HC group (HC, BMI matched), we further restricted inclusion to participants with a score below 12 on the Finnish Type-2 Diabetes Risk Score questionnaire (FINDRISC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">20</ref> , indicating slight metabolic risk. HC, BMI matched subjects were matched to the T2D, on semaglutide group by age, gender, IPAQ, and BMI. For the second HC group (HC, low-BMI), inclusion was restricted to participants with a score below 7 on the FINDRISC (low metabolic risk), and a BMI of 18.5 -25. HC, low-BMI subjects were matched to the T2D, on semaglutide group by age, gender, and IPAQ.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study procedure</head><p>The main testing session consisted of three parts: a brief assessment of changes in medication (including diabetes medication and other daily medication) since the screening, an effort-based decision-making task, and a baeery of self-report questionnaires.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Effort-based decision-making task</head><p>We adopted a previously described effort-expenditure task <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">12</ref> to assess effortbased decision-making online. The task starts with a calibration phase in which subjects are prompted to click as fast as they can for ten seconds, repeated across three trials. The average of trials two and three are used as a reference for effort calibration. To familiarize subjects with their individual effort levels, a practice trial of each effort level must be completed. The main task consists of 64 trials, split into four blocks. In each trial, participants decide whether to accept or reject a challenge associated with effort and reward (points won throughout the game). When accepting a challenge, the associated effort level must be completed to obtain the reward. If a challenge is rejected, subjects wait and receive one point. The presentation of effort-reward combinations is made semi-adaptively by randomly interleaved staircases: when a challenge is accepted, the next offer is adjusted by increasing effort or decreasing reward, while the opposite is implemented after challenges are rejected.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Self-report questionnaires</head><p>Subjects completed self-report questionnaires, presented in randomized order. We assessed psychiatric variables using the Snaith-Hamilton Anhedonia Rating Scale (SHAPS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">21</ref> and the Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES) <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">22</ref> . To target circadian rhythm, we included the Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">23</ref> and the Munich Chronotype Questionnaire (MCTQ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">24</ref> . Additionally, we assessed diabetes risk using the FINDRISC <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">20</ref> .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Compliance checks and exclusion criteria</head><p>Participants were excluded at the time of screening when reporting a severe neurological disorder or English proficiency below B2 (i.e., good command/working knowledge).</p><p>No subjects were excluded following our pre-registered task-based exclusion criteria. Four aeention check questions were included in the questionnaires to assess questionnaire adherence. This included two easy questions (e.g., "Please answer 'Not at all'") and two harder questions (e.g., "When I am thirsty, spoiled milk is my drink of choice", expected answer: Definitively false). Participants were excluded when failing at least one easy question, or both harder questions (n = 3).</p><p>Further, we excluded participants reporting conflicting data regarding their health or medication status between the screening and the main study session (n = 19), as well as subjects reporting anthropometric data resulting in a BMI more than two standard deviations above the median (n = 5). Taken together, a total of n = 13 participants on semaglutide and n = 12 participants off semaglutide were excluded from analyses.</p></div>

We investigated main effects of effort-and reward-levels and their interaction, using a mixed-effects analysis of variances (ANOVA) of repeated measures.</p><p>For model-based analyses, we considered a model space of six models, all of which are variations on a standard economic decision-theory model. In brief, rewards (R) are discounted by effort (E), weighted by sensitivity parameters (𝛽 ! and 𝛽 " for reward and effort sensitivity), forming the subjective value (SV) of an action:</p><p>The SV is transformed to an acceptance probability by a softmax function:</p><p>with 𝑝(𝑎𝑐𝑐𝑒𝑝𝑡) for the predicted acceptance probability and 𝛼 for the intercept representing motivational tendency. Models differed from each other in their implemented discounting function (parabolic or linear) and the in-or exclusion of free parameters reward sensitivity (weighting of the reward magnitude during decision making) and motivational tendency (decision tendency towards exerting effort), resulting in a model space of six models (parabolic/linear x with/without reward sensitivity x with/without motivational tendency). See 12 for a validation study of the model space, including parameter recovery and posterior predictive checks and heps://github.com/smehrhof/effort-study/tree/main/code/stan for the model code.</p><p>We took a hierarchical Bayesian approach to model fieing, using weakly informative Gaussian priors for all free parameters, at both the group-and individual-level. Models were fieed in the R Stan interface cmdstanr, using Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling (6000 iterations by four chains, 2000 warm-up samples). The performance of our six models was compared based on out-of-sample predictive accuracy using the leave-one-out cross-validation information criterion (LOOIC; lower values are beeer) and expected log predictive density (ELPD; higher values are beeer).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Group comparisons</head><p>Group comparisons between our four study groups were conducted using one-way ANOVAs, with group status predicting computational parameter estimates and questionnaire scores. To follow up on significant effects, multiple comparisons were conducted.</p></div>
