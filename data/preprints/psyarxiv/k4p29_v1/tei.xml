<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>People's subjective conceptions of truth and honesty have undergone significant changes in recent decades. Parts of society increasingly favour the sincere expression of personal belief, however inaccurate, over verifiable facts. This trend has been accompanied by increasing norm violations by political elites which have been identified as a significant contributor to democratic backsliding. Those two trends highlight the need for a thorough examination of the nexus between norm violations and conceptions of honesty. We present a series of preregistered studies that examined the conditions under which people acquiesce to democratic norm violations and politicians' dishonesty. We find that when participants are asked to take a perspective of honesty that emphasises sincerity over accuracy, which we call "belief-speaking", they are more willing to accept norm violations by politicians than if participants take a perspective that emphasizes accuracy as a criterion for honesty, which we call "fact-speaking". When a fictitious politician is presented as telling untruths, tolerance of norm violations is reduced compared to when the politician is presented as truthful. The findings highlight the need to develop a better understanding of how individuals interpret and respond to political leaders' behaviours, especially within the evolving landscape of perception and the ensuing threats to democratic stability.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Democratic governance is a balancing act between respecting the will of the majority while also protecting minority views. No one is born as a good citizen and no state is born as a democracy-both people and society are in constant flux and democracy cannot be taken for granted. Threats against democracy are manifold, and many countries are currently experiencing democratic backsliding (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Lührmann &amp; Lindberg, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Nord et al., 2024)</ref>. The global rise of autocracy and the extreme right under the banner of "populism" is well-documented (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bauer &amp; Becker, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Levitsky &amp; Way, 2002)</ref> and poses significant challenges to democratic governance and societal stability.</p><p>A defining attribute of right-wing populism is that it considers society to be divided into two implacably opposed camps, namely "the people", who are virtuous and whose will must prevail, and "the elites", who are corrupt and seek to obstruct the will of the people <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bang &amp; Marsh, 2018)</ref>. By rejecting the idea of a plurality of legitimate opinions and, in most cases, concentrating power in the hands of a single leader, right-wing populism erodes the foundations of democracy <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bang &amp; Marsh, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Juon &amp; Bochsler, 2020)</ref>. 1     Right-wing populists present themselves as the true champion of the people, the outsider-on-the-inside, who dares to take on the "elite". The mythical "elite" is redefined as needed for the populist leader to retain their claim to be on the side of the "people"even when they hold power and are the elite, populist leaders will conjure up a shadowy "deep state", intellectuals, public-health officials, the judiciary, or any other presumed or actual opponent as the elite or "enemies of the people" <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bos et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>1 Some (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Tormey, 2018)</ref> argue that there is also left-wing populism which can have beneficial consequences for society through e.g., increased political participation, but this debate is not pertinent to the current paper. Here we focus exclusively on right-wing extremism under the banner of populism, which has been identified as the greatest risk to democracy, at least in Europe <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Svolik et al., 2023)</ref>. This stance has two major consequences. First, the violation of institutional norms, such as those of mutual tolerance, institutional forbearance (i.e., not merely assessing the legality of an action but also its normative acceptability), or judicial independence, becomes a sign of distinction rather than a stigma <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bellolio, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Bucy et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Juon &amp; Bochsler, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Levitsky &amp; Ziblatt, 2018)</ref>. For example, when British Prime Minister Boris Johnson suspended the U.K. Parliament for five weeks in 2019, thus eliminating Parliament's ability to scrutinise the government's Brexit policy, he was cheered on by much of the tabloid media as taking on the "elite" (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Schleiter &amp; Fleming, 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Second, right-wing populists often appeal to the "common sense" of "the people" as a source of truth, rejecting "elitist" notions such as evidence and expertise <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Young et al., 2023)</ref>. The right-wing populist leader dares to do what others do not <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Sorensen, 2023)</ref>. For them, truth-telling based on facts and expertise constitutes a form of control and they instead consider truth as a political endeavor necessitating loyalty to leaders and causes <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Waisbord, 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Democratic norm violations and widespread dishonesty are nearly inescapable consequences of right-wing populism and have been well-documented in the literature (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Farkas, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Kingzette et al., 2021)</ref>. Less is known, however, about why the public would tolerate such assaults on democratic governance. For example, while one might expect that politicians who are pervasive purveyors of misinformation suffer reputational costs, those costs are often not observed in experiments <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Swire et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Swire-Thompson et al., 2020)</ref> or indeed at the ballot box <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(De Figueiredo et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Graham &amp; Svolik, 2020)</ref>.</p><p>To date, one stream of research that seeks to understand public acquiescence to dishonesty and norm violations has focused on the role of people's disgruntlement or disenfranchisement, two principal drivers of endorsement of populist parties <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Drache &amp; Froese, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Fahey et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Obradović et al., 2020)</ref>. In one experiment, lying politicians were found to gather support when at least one constituency saw the political system as flawed or felt excluded by it. By contrast, when the system was perceived to be fair, lying politicians were not tolerated <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Hahl et al., 2018)</ref>. Politicians who lie pervasively may thus be perceived as strong leaders by their supporters; that is, as someone who can solve or win a perceived inter-group conflict <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Laustsen &amp; Petersen, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Petersen, 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Similarly, violation of the norm of civility has been found to be tolerated by people with populist attitudes <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Vargiu et al., 2024)</ref>. Politicians who violate norms are seen as more dominant and prestigious in situations of competition and are rewarded with more support from citizens <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Homan et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Stamkou et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">van Kleef et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>Given the threats that norm violations by political elites pose to democratic stability, understanding public reactions to them is crucial (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Druckman, 2023)</ref>. Previous research has discovered that neither partisanship nor policy agreement with a politician are sufficient in explaining tolerance of undemocratic behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Frederiksen, 2022)</ref>. While partisanship plays a role in explaining such tolerance, it does not fully explain it and it is unknown which types of norm violations are more tolerated than others and whether there are specific preconditions that make norm violations by politicians more tolerable.</p><p>A second stream of research has focused on the role of different ontologies or subjective conceptions of truth and honesty (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Cooper et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Lewandowsky, 2021)</ref>.</p><p>In a right-wing populist logic, the honesty of communication is established more in an actor-based instead of a claim-based framework; there is a greater focus on the authenticity and sincerity of the person making a claim ("he says it how it is") than there is on the truthfulness of the claim itself. The two end points of a continuum from an emphasis on accuracy to reliance on sincerity as markers of honesty have been labeled, respectively, fact-speaking and belief-speaking <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Lasser et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Lewandowsky et al., 2020</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Lewandowsky et al., , 2024))</ref>.</p><p>Fact-speaking focuses on accuracy of claims and tends to make explicit reference to evidence. Belief-speaking, by contrast, focuses on the sincerity and authenticity of the speaker without references to external reality. An exclusive focus on sincerity of the speaker can contribute to the acceptance and further spread of misinformation <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Hahl et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Lasser et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Lewandowsky, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Vargiu &amp; Nai, 2022)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>EVOLUTION OF TRUTH AND IMPLICATIONS FOR DEMOCRACY 6</head><p>We present a series of studies that examined the conditions under which people acquiesce to democratic norm violations and politicians' dishonesty. We approached the problem from the perspective of the different notions of honesty just introduced. We examine the role of personal attributes, such as people's subjective views of what constitutes honesty, as well as the effects of an experimental intervention that encourages people to take a fact-speaking or belief-speaking perspective on honesty.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>We conducted three preregistered studies that involved the same three fully-crossed experimental variables in a between-participants design. We instructed participants to take either a fact-speaking or belief-speaking perspective during the experiment, by presenting a vignette from <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Vargiu and Nai (2022)</ref> describing the perspective of "Sam" (belief-speaking) or "Taylor" (fact-speaking) (see Appendix A for full vignettes). In Experiment 1, to measure participants' preference for sincerity or accuracy, they were asked to respond to the epistemic-preferences section of the Evidence-Intuition Scale (EIS; <ref type="bibr">Abels &amp; Lewandowsky, 2024)</ref> at the beginning of the experiment. Participants were then allocated to the perspective that aligned most with their epistemic preferences, i.e. belief-speaking (sincerity) or fact-speaking (accuracy). In Experiments 2 and 3, the allocation into belief-speaking or fact-speaking was randomized. Utilising the epistemic-preferences items from the EIS allowed us to understand participants' pre-existing views on honesty, which were then reinforced with the presentation of the vignettes. In Experiment 2, these scores were acquired from earlier research that participants had participated in <ref type="bibr">Abels and Lewandowsky (2024)</ref>, and in Experiment 3 the EIS was administered at the end of the experiment to avoid carry-over effects. (Which inevitably entailed the trade-off that the experimental intervention might be altering people's response pattern.)</p><p>After participants read the vignette that assigned or confirmed their perspective, we presented participants with synthetic scenarios that described the actions of a hypothetical politician ("Mr. Smith"). Depending on the experimental condition, the scenarios either presented Mr. Smith as norm abiding or in violation of three democratic norms (by seeking an expansion of his parliamentary power, by being systematically dishonest, and by inciting protests in support of his agenda). Orthogonally, the scenarios presented Mr.</p><p>Smith either as lying or as not lying in specific cases such as the statistical evidence he used to support his agenda. See the online supplementary material for the full scenarios.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> illustrates the common elements of the procedure for all experiments.</p><p>After presentation of the scenario, participants judged the acceptability of the three norm violations (see online supplement for items) and then rated the perceived honesty and likeability of Mr. Smith by responding to questions about 11 different (Experiment 1) personal attributes; accuracy, authenticity, competence, genuineness, sincerity, honesty, truthfulness, prestige, considerateness, warmth, and likeability. In Experiment 1 an Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) was carried out to examine the associations among the 11 judged attributes of Mr. Smith. Attributes were then aggregated into two composite scores representing the two factors "perceived honesty" (consisting of seven items of accuracy, authenticity, competence, genuineness, sincerity, honesty, and truthfulness) and "likeability" (consisting of two items of likeability and warmth). The items for prestige and considerateness were dropped from analyses because of low factor loadings. Those item were not included as items in Experiments 2 and 3 (see "Methods" for full description of EFA). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Effects of perspective</head><p>When participants took a belief-speaking perspective, they generally became more tolerant of norm violations than when they adopted a fact-speaking perspective. Turning first to incitement, Experiments 2 and 3 (but not 1) showed a small and medium effect of perspective, (F (1, 286) = 12.650, p &lt; 0.001, η 2 p = .04, and F (1, 441) = 21.576, p &lt; 0.001, η 2 p = 0.05, respectively. In both cases, belief-speaking raised tolerance for incitement.</p><p>Similarly, belief-speaking increased tolerance for dishonesty across all three studies. In Experiments 1 and 2, the effect was medium-sized, F (1, 230) = 21.120, p &lt; .001, η 2 p = .08</p><p>and F (1, 286) = 14.033, p &lt; 0.001, η 2 p = .05, respectively. In Experiment 3, there was a small main effect of perspective F (1, 441) = 11.898, p &lt; 0.001, η 2 p = 0.03. Finally, belief-speaking also made people more accepting of an expansion of power in all three experiments. In Experiments 1 and 2, the main effect of perspective had a medium effect size; F (1, 230) = 20.099, p &lt; .001, η 2 p = .08 and F (1, 286) = 16.022, p &lt; 0.001, η 2 p = .05, respectively. In Experiment 3, the effect was small F (1, 441) = 21.750, p &lt; 0.001, η 2 p = 0.05.</p><p>In addition, in Experiment 2, perspective interacted with normativity, F (1, 286) = 4.745, p = 0.03, η 2 p = .02, reflecting the fact that when Mr. Smith was violating norms and participant's perspective was that of belief-speaking, they were more tolerant of expansion of power than when the behaviour was norm abiding. This interaction is illustrated in panel a of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>.</p><p>Perspective had a small, significant impact on perceived honesty -a factor score consisting of ratings for accuracy, authenticity, competence, genuineness, sincerity, honesty, and truthfulness -in Experiments 1 F (1, 230) = 7.814, p = 0.00562, η 2 p = 0.03 and 3</p><p>F (1, 441) = 4.850, p = 0.0282, η 2 p = 0.01 indicating that when participants had the perspective of fact-speaking, they viewed Mr. Smith as more honest.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Effects of normativity</head><p>Normativity had no significant effects on incitement, dishonesty, or expansion of power. However, perceived honesty of Mr. Smith was affected by normativity in all studies.</p><p>In Experiment 1 there was a large main effect, F (1, 230) = 36.194, p &lt; 0.001, η 2 p = 0.14, in Experiment 2 there was a small effect F (1, 286) = 8.812, p = 0.00325, η 2 p = .03, and in Experiment 3 it was medium-sized F (1, 441) = 44.669, p &lt; 0.001, η 2 p = 0.09. This indicates that when Mr. Smith was norm abiding, he was perceived as more honest than when he was violating norms. Further to this, as illustrated in panel b of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>, in Experiment 1 there was an interaction between perspective and normativity F (1, 230) = 5.637, p = 0.018, η 2 p = 0.00811, as well as between normativity and truthfulness F (1, 230) = 4.982, p = 0.0266, η 2 p = 0.02, which is illustrated in panel c. These interactions indicate that when a participant's perspective was that of fact-speaking and Mr. Smith was violating norms, his attempts at expanding his power were less tolerated than if a participants' perspective was that of belief-speaking. Further, when Mr. Smith was lying and violating norms, he was perceived as less honest than when he was not lying and behaved normatively.</p><p>In all three experiments there was a medium-sized main effect of normativity on the factor score of likeability, which consisted of attributes likeability and warmth; Experiment F (1, 441) = 6.598, p = 0.0105, η 2 p = 0.01. This consistently shows that when Mr. Smith is lying, participants are less tolerant of his attempts to incite the public. For dishonesty, there were no significant main effects of truthfulness in Experiments 1 or 3 but there was a small main effect in Experiment 2 F (1, 286) = 3.965, p = 0.047, η 2 p = 0.01, which showed that when Mr. Smith was lying, there was a lower tolerance for his dishonesty than when he was not lying. Truthfulness had a significant, small, main effect on expansion of power in Experiment 2 F (1, 286) = 4.091, p = 0.044, η 2 p = 0.01 and Experiment 3</p><p>F (1, 441) = 5.341, p = 0.0213, η 2 p = 0.01, indicating that when Mr. Smith was not lying, his attempts at expansion of power were more tolerable.</p><p>Truthfulness also had a significant, medium-sized, effect on the perceived honesty factor; Experiment 1 F (1, 230) = 20.487, p &lt; 0.001, η 2 p = 0.08, Experiment 2 F (1, 286) = 22.490, p &lt; 0.001, η 2 p = 0.07, and Experiment 3 F (1, 441) = 27.682, p &lt; 0.001, η 2 p = 0.06. This consistently shows that when Mr. Smith was lying, he was perceived as less honest. For the likeability factor in Experiment 2, there was a small main effect of lies F (1, 286) = 9.503, p = 0.00225, η 2 p = 0.03, indicating that when Mr. Smith was lying, he was perceived as less likeable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Exploratory analyses</head><p>To examine the impact of a participants' pre-existing preference for evidence versus intuition, we repeated the preceding analyses using ANCOVAs with the Evidence-Intuition Scale (EIS; Abels &amp; Lewandowsky, 2024) scores as covariates. Here we only report results that differ statistically from those without the covariate. Full results of the two-way ANCOVAs can be found in the online supplement.</p><p>In Experiment 2, inclusion of the covariate led to the emergence of a small interaction between truthfulness and perspective on dishonesty F (1, 259) = 4.331, p = 0.0384, η 2 p = 0.02, and an interaction between truthfulness and expansion of power F (1, 259) = 4.502, p = 0.0348, η 2 p = 0.02. Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref> illustrates the interactions.</p><p>In Experiments 2 and 3, EIS was a significant covariate for expansion of power, F (1, 259) = 7.656, p = 0.00607, η 2 p = 0.03, F (1, 440) = 21.961, p &lt; 0.001, η 2 p = 0.01. In Experiment 3, EIS was also a significant covariate for perceived honesty F (1, 440) = 4.255, p = 0.04, η 2 p = 0.01. Higher scores on the EIS indicated preference for evidence over intuition. Participants who scored higher on the EIS were less likely to tolerate expansion of power or perceive Mr. Smith as honest than those who scored lower and preferred intuition over evidence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>In all three experiments, we consistently found that when participants were asked to take a belief-speaking perspective-that is, when they were asked to view sincerity and authenticity as central components of honesty-people were more likely to tolerate norm violations by political elites. We also found that norm violations have a significant impact on the perceived honesty and likeability of a fictitious political leader; when he is violating norms, he is seen as less honest and likeable. In addition, the identification of specific lies in the scenarios resulted in the politician being viewed as less honest.</p><p>While a participant's EIS score was a significant covariate for the analyses involving expansion of power and perceived honesty in Experiments 2 and 3, across the other dependent variables there was no significant impact of the EIS. This suggests that although pre-existing conceptions of honesty can influence people's assessment of a political leader's behaviour, in our data this impact was small in comparison to the impact of perspective-taking. Thus, our results show that honesty conceptions can be experimentally manipulated, resulting in people being more (or less) tolerant of norm violations by political elites.</p><p>With previous research having identified belief-speaking (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Lasser et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Sorensen &amp; Krämer, 2024)</ref> and norm violations (e.g. Ruth-Lovell &amp; Grahn, 2023) as central aspects of right-wing populism, our research makes important contributions to this.</p><p>Right-wing populists' regular appeals to people's "common sense" (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Young et al., 2023)</ref> can be very powerful when people prefer sincerity over accuracy. Indeed, populist politicians have been characterised as displaying a particular set of behaviours, which ultimately makes them more charismatic <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Nai &amp; Martínez i Coma, 2019)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Young et al. (2023)</ref> has shown that various populist attitudes, such as valuing intuition over evidence and belief in misinformation, occur concurrently and can be mutually reinforcing. Thus, one could argue that it is simply a populist attitude cluster being activated when participants are asked to take a belief-speaking perspective. This would then prime a person to tolerate norm violations as it is a part of the same attitude cluster. However, this relationship is likely to be more complex given the disconnect between political leaders' willingness to break democratic norms and citizens explicit acceptance of these. People in general still value and support democratic norms <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Holliday et al., 2024)</ref>. Moreover, the mechanism of how exactly people become tolerant of norm violations is not particularly relevant from a pragmatic point of view -what matters is the activation of such attitudes itself and the consequences of that. Our data shows for the first time that this preference for belief-speaking can be experimentally manipulated and has drastic flow-on consequences for the acceptance of democratic norm violations. This finding supports the notion that belief-speaking is a fundamental aspect of right-wing populist communication.</p><p>The propensity for belief-speaking to lead to greater tolerance of norm violations has significant implications. Recent analyses of democratic backsliding have identified elite norm violations to be a crucial contributor <ref type="bibr">(Abels et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Druckman, 2023)</ref>. Elite norm violations can occur on a variety of levels, ranging from persistent dishonesty (such as Donald Trump making over 30,000 false or misleading claims during his tenure as president <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[Kessler et al. (2021)</ref>] or political elites sharing misinformation online), to EVOLUTION OF TRUTH AND IMPLICATIONS FOR DEMOCRACY 13 political maneuverings that breach convention or represent a grab for power. Even though there are institutional mechanisms that can address elite norm violations, these often work retroactively and can be slow. For instance, when the suspension of the British parliament by Boris Johnson was ultimately found to be unlawful by the U.K. Supreme Court, it had no notable political consequences for Johnson and most of the media continued to support him <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Schleiter &amp; Fleming, 2020)</ref>. Our results show increased tolerance for such behaviours in people who prefer (or are asked to prefer) belief-speaking over fact-speaking, which can have concerning consequences.</p><p>People who prioritise belief-speaking over fact-speaking (and vice versa) can start to seek the company of those with similar views of the world, leading to formation of echo chambers or even epistemic bubbles that reinforce subjective truths <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Young et al., 2023)</ref>.</p><p>Echo chambers have been found to decrease ambivalence towards political parties, which means that members are likely to have decreased negative views towards their party <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Justwan et al., 2018)</ref>. Although there is some dispute about the existence of echo chambers, recent work has shown high ideological segregation between liberal and conservative audiences on Facebook and other social media platforms <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Cinelli et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">González-Bailón et al., 2023)</ref>. Partisans in echo chambers are less likely to encounter criticisms about their party as well as balanced reporting about other parties, which threatens deliberative processes crucial for democracy <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Garimella et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Hobolt &amp; Tilley, 2023)</ref>. These effects of echo chambers illustrate the need to be exposed to a variety of views and opinions, which can be difficult to achieve in a polarized society <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Axelrod et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>As to why we found no effect of Mr. Smith's normativity on tolerance of norm violations, it is possible that the type of norm violations themselves are not important but the combined societal effects of them are (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Holliday et al., 2024</ref>). People's attitudes towards democratic norms may transcend the specifics of their experiences; people will tolerate hypothetical future violations as much or as little as any actual violations they EVOLUTION OF TRUTH AND IMPLICATIONS FOR DEMOCRACY 14 have already witnessed. In our experiments, participants may have perceived the specific norm violations to be acceptable since the overall societal situation appeared stable.</p><p>Further, it has been discovered that nondemocratic actions can be perceived to be democratic if committed by actors who have risen to power through democratic means <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Hinterleitner &amp; Sager, 2022)</ref>. In our experiments, the politician's rise to power was not questioned, which may have given him legitimacy. Further, the norm violations perhaps</p><p>were not seen as destabilising the democratic system as a whole, since the politician explained that the changes would be for a greater good.</p><p>The impact of truthfulness on tolerance of norm violations on the other hand may be related to the saliency and value of honesty. Although dishonesty is not uncommon in modern societies and can be beneficial for political success <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Ceron &amp; Carrara, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Kurvers et al., 2021)</ref>, tolerance for them is context dependent <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Aycinena et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Eriksson et al., 2021)</ref>. Particularly when honesty is made a salient value, it influences people's assessment of political leaders and makes lies less tolerable <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Croco et al., 2021)</ref>. Thus, it is likely that in our experiment participants were paying more attention to the honesty of a politician and when they were exposed to have lied, tolerance for norm violations was decreased.</p><p>Our results indicate a consistent link between preference for belief-speaking over fact-speaking and tolerance for norm violations. While pre-existing perceptions of honesty can influence people's assessment of a political leader's behaviour, in our data this impact was small in comparison to the impact of perspective-taking. Importantly, our data shows belief-speaking to be a fundamental aspect of tolerance for norm violations -when people's perspectives of honesty are manipulated, their tolerance changes. Taking a belief-speaking perspective made people more tolerant of various norm violations, despite the politician being viewed as less honest in most cases. This finding has significant implications for modern democracies. It suggests that politicians' appeals for authenticity over accuracy can be successful in making people more willing to accept various norm violations and thereby tolerate democratic backsliding. This understanding can help Following this, participants were presented with a scenario developed for this study describing the actions of a hypothetical politician, Mr. Smith, who was always presented as matching participants' perspective of belief-speaking or fact-speaking. In addition, the scenario instantiated two fully-crossed experimental factors, normativity and truthfulness.</p><p>Mr Smith was presented to be either norm abiding or in violation of three democratic norms (dishonesty, incitement, and expansion of power), and orthogonally, as telling the truth or lying. Participants were randomly assigned to a cell of the normativity × truthfulness design. Full scenarios are available in the online supplementary material.</p><p>Participants could spend an unlimited amount of time reading the scenario. After reading the scenario, participants responded to 9 questions about their tolerance for norm violations, with three items for each norm violation (dishonesty, incitement, and expansion of power). All items are available in the online supplement. Participants then responded to 9 questions about the attributes of Mr. Smith (in Experiment 1 there were 11 attributes, which were reduced to 9 items through an exploratory factor analysis).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data processing</head><p>In Experiment 1, a mean of the epistemic belief section ("sincerity" and "accuracy")</p><p>from <ref type="bibr">Abels and Lewandowsky (2024)</ref> was calculated within Qualtrics to assign a participant to the appropriate perspective, either belief-speaking or fact-speaking.</p><p>In Experiment 1, an Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) with maximum likelihood extraction and direct oblimin rotation was carried out to examine the associations among the 11 judged attributes of Mr. Smith. The Kaiser-Olkin Measure of Sampling adequacy (.620) and Bartlett's test of sphericity [x 2 (3) = 379.19, p &lt; .001] indicated that the 11 items had adequate common variance for EFA. The analysis revealed that the data had a two-factor structure consisting of factors "Perceived honesty" which explained 74.4% of variance (factor loadings of the six items were 0.61 to 0.98), and "Likeability", which explained 25.6%(factor loadings of the two items were 0.61 and 0.87). Two items were dropped as they did not significantly contribute to either factor. A two-factor structure was accepted for the remainder of the analyses. Perceived honesty scores were calculated by multiplying the ratings of accuracy, authenticity, competence, genuineness, sincerity, honesty, and truthfulness by their loadings and dividing by the sum of the loadings. The likeability scores were computed analogously by considering warmth and likeability.</p><p>For Experiments 2 and 3 a Confirmatory Factor Analysis (available in the online supplement) was carried out to ascertain the correct factor loadings for computation of the the factor scores. Because 2 items were dropped after the first study, Experiments 2 and 3 only used 9 items to probe attributes of Mr. Smith.</p><p>In all experiments, tolerance of norm violations was calculated by forming the mean across items separately for dishonesty, incitement and expansion of power.
