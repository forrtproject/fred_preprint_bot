<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>disentangling genetic and environmental factors</head><p>As of April 2023, there are 4.80 billion social media users, equivalent to 59.9 % of the global population. Individuals daily spend on average around 2 and a half hours on social media platforms <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Datareportal, 2023)</ref>. Over the last decade, the number of people using social media platforms has been consistently growing. Public and governmental organizations are paying more attention to social media use, and its potential positive and negative effects on individuals, such as their wellbeing and mental health <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Pereira et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Izutsu et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Wellbeing can be broadly categorized as subjective (or hedonic) and psychological (or eudaimonic) wellbeing <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Deci &amp; Ryan, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Ryff, 1989)</ref>. Hedonic wellbeing consists of cognitive and affective evaluations of one's life, whereas eudaimonic wellbeing refers to positive functioning which entails multiple domains such as having positive relations, autonomy, environmental mastery, positive growth, purpose in life, and self-acceptance <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Ryff, 1989)</ref>. Higher levels of wellbeing are associated with a wide range of positive outcomes such as having better social relations, and finances, as well as higher school achievement, altruistic behaviour, and workplace functioning <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Chapman &amp; Guven, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">James et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Maccagnan et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">Okabe-Miyamoto &amp; Lyubomirsky, in press;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Oswald et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Steptoe, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Walsh et al., 2018)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Association between WB/DS and SMU</head><p>In recent years, there has been a strong increase in the number of studies on the association between social media use with wellbeing and anxious-depressive symptoms <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Valkenburg, 2022)</ref>. For instance, multiple meta-review studies, combining results of the meta-analyses, indicated either small to moderate effect sizes or inconsistent results <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Appel et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr">Valkenburg, Beyens, et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr">Valkenburg, Meier, et al., 2022)</ref>. The most recent meta-review included 27 review studies on SMU and WB/ADS published (including 9 metaanalyses and 9 systematic reviews) between 2019 and 2021 <ref type="bibr">(Valkenburg, Beyens, et al., 2022)</ref>. This study reported that six out of seven meta-analyses found effect sizes that ranged from very small to moderate (absolute correlations, r = 0.05-0.17), while one meta-analysis reported mainly null results <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Cunningham et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>Overall, the lack of inconsistent results has been partly attributed to overreliance on cross-sectional research (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Parry et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr">Valkenburg, Beyens et al., 2022)</ref>. As a potential solution to this, multiple studies used longitudinal data sets. For example, a study found small negative associations for WB with retrospectively reported and diary-logged digital screen engagement as a measure of SMU (r = -0.08, and r = -0.02, respectively) <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Orben &amp; Przybylski, 2019)</ref>. Similarly, another longitudinal study investigated ADS and SMU of a group of individuals from 10 to 16 years with 2-year lags. The results indicated null within-person level associations and a few small (between r = 0.04-0.07) associations at the between-person level <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Steinsbekk et al., 2023)</ref>. Other longitudinal studies applied a more person-centric approach by investigating whether the associations differed for each individual. Their results showed that the association between WB/ADS and SMU differs in both direction and magnitude among among individuals over time. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Beyens et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Pouwels et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>It has also been considered whether different ways of assessing social media use could lead to different results <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Hogue &amp; Mills, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Verduyn et al., 2017</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Verduyn et al., , 2022))</ref>. Social media use can be categorised in active social media use (e.g., posting frequency, sending messages) or passive usage measures (e.g., scrolling), in which passive SMU is considered to have a negative influence on wellbeing, whereas active SMU's influence is considered to be less conclusive. For instance, a study using a population sample of Icelandic adolescents (N = 10,563) reported increased passive social media use to be associated with increased anxiety and depressive symptoms, and these effects persisted after controlling for time spent on social media. Another study, in a sample of adults between 18-49 age (N = 702), reported an association between increased passive SMU and negative wellbeing, but reported the opposite results for active SMU <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Escobar-Viera et al., 2018)</ref>. Further, although active and passive SMU distinctions in the assessment of SMU exist, there is no consensus on the usefulness of active versus passive social media usage measures in the field <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Valkenburg, Van Driel, et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Verduyn et al., 2017</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Verduyn et al., , 2022))</ref>.</p><p>Overall, evidence indicated that small associations between WB/ADS and SMU are present. Furthermore, most studies assume the direction of the association to be from increased SMU to decreased WB/increased ADS, yet substantial evidence to claim the direction of causation is missing given the cross-sectional nature of most studies in this field.</p><p>Besides the size and the direction of the associations between WB/ADS and SMU variables, it is crucial to study the underlying sources of the associations between WB/ADS and SMU. In particular, by leveraging genetically informed designs, it can be investigated whether the phenotypic association between two variables is partly due to overlapping genetic factors that influence both WB/ADS and SMU. As an example of a genetically informative design, the classical twin design can be used. Classical twin designs are based on data from monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins, which allow for disentangling the effects of genetic and environmental influences on the observed covariance between WB/ADS and SMU (i.e., <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">De Vries et al., 2021)</ref>. In addition to estimating the underlying sources of covariance, multivariate models provide the opportunity to calculate the genetic and environmental correlations that indicate the overlap in genetic and environmental factors between phenotypes.</p><p>For the relation between WB/ADS and SMU to be partly driven by genetics, it is a prerequisite that each of these traits is heritable. Evidence based on genetically informed designs (e.g., twin studies, molecular genetic studies) indicates individual differences in WB, ADS, and SMU to be partly accounted for by genetic factors. For instance, heritability estimates for WB were 40% to 50% (for a review and meta-analysis see, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bartels, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Nes &amp; Røysamb, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Van De Weijer et al., 2022)</ref>. Similarly, for ADS, twin-based heritability estimates ranging from 49% to 60% were found throughout childhood into adulthood in one study <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Baselmans et al., 2018)</ref>, supported by heritability estimates of 37% found in a metaanalysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Sullivan et al., 2000)</ref> and a recent review study which has mentioned heritability estimates ranging between 30% to 50% <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Kendall et al., 2021)</ref>. Although based on a single study, heritability estimates of 67% and 40% have been reported for SMU, particularly for SMU for communicating with friends and using SMU for contacting family members living in other households, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(York, 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Applying a multivariate approach genetic influence of 46% and 50% was found for the covariance between WB and ADS in two separate studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Baselmans et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Routledge et al., 2016)</ref>. These results indicate that at least close to half of the (negative) phenotypic correlation between WB and ADS was explained by genetic factors (and the remaining covariance was due to unique environmental factors). Furthermore, moderate to strong genetic correlations (r = -0.60/ r = -0.71 ) and environmental correlations (r = -0.48/ r = -0.43) were found. The negative genetic correlation between WB and ADS found in these studies indicated a moderate overlap between the underlying set of genetic factors that positively influence WB, negatively influence ADS, and vice versa. The same logic can be applied to the negative environmental correlations found between WB and ADS: a substantial part of the environmental factors positively associated with WB is the same for ADS but negatively associated with ADS levels.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The present study</head><p>In the present study, we apply a multivariate twin design to disentangle additive genetic and environmental effects (shared and non-shared) to investigate the underlying sources of the observed association between WB/ADS and SMU. Additionally, we calculate genetic and environmental correlations to assess the degree of overlap in the genetic and environmental factors that influence these phenotypes. We use both hedonic and eudaimonic WB measures to capture a complete picture of human well-functioning, and we use a separate ADS measure to assess illbeing (see the recommendations in, <ref type="bibr">Valkenburg, Beyens, et al., 2022)</ref>. To detect social media use from different angles we included the time spent on different social media platforms (SMUt), the frequency of posting on social media (SMUf), and the number of social media accounts individuals have <ref type="bibr">(SMUn)</ref> The phenotypic association between WB and SMU, as well as ADS and SMU, may potentially differ for different sex and age groups, in that younger individuals and females might be more prone to lower wellbeing/higher illbeing associated with more social media use (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Orben et al., 2022)</ref>. Therefore, we included both age and sex as a covariate in our analyses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head><p>The description of the dataset and the planned analyses were preregistered before analysing the dataset. The analysis plan and the (arguments for) deviations from this plan can be found on the Open Science Foundation (OSF) website (https://osf.io/jr4xc/)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample and Participants</head><p>The data used in this study were obtained from the Netherlands Twin Register (NTR; <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Ligthart et al., 2019)</ref> after meeting the requirements posited by the NTR Data Access Committee and obtaining their permission. In total, the sample included 6492 individuals, including 3369 MZ twins (893 complete twin pairs, 1583 incomplete twin pairs) and 3123 DZ twins (445 complete, 2233 incomplete). The mean age in the sample was 35.10 (SD = 14.93, range = 16 -89). The sample consisted of 71% females (n = 4618).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures</head><p>Hedonic wellbeing -Hedonic wellbeing was assessed with the satisfaction with life scale <ref type="bibr">(SWL, Diener et al., 1985)</ref>, the subjective happiness scale (SHS, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Lyubomirsky &amp; Lepper, 1999)</ref>, and a single-item measure of quality of life <ref type="bibr">(QoL, Cantril, 1965)</ref>. The SWL scale consisted of five items and the SHS consisted of four items (the fourth item was reversecoded). Both measures were responded to on a 7-point Likert scale with answer options ranging from strongly disagree to strongly agree. An example item for satisfaction with life scale is: "I am satisfied with my life." An example item for the subjective happiness scale is "Compared with most of my peers, I am less happy than they are." The items were summed to obtain an overall SWL and SHS score.</p><p>The exact item used for QoL consisted of the following two sentences: "Where on the scale would you put your life in general? A score of 10 means the best life you can imagine, and zero means the worst life you can imagine". The participants provided their responses by using a ten-step ladder. In the present sample, the reliability of the SWL and SH scales were 0.87 and 0.89, respectively. Single-item measures for wellbeing (such as Cantril Ladder in this case) are usually found reliable <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Lucas &amp; Brent Donnellan, 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Eudaimonic wellbeing -Eudaimonic wellbeing was assessed by calculating a sum of responses on the Flourishing Scale (FL; <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Diener et al., 2010)</ref>. The scale consists of eight items that could be responded to on a 7-point Likert scale with answer options ranging from strongly disagree to strongly agree. An example item was: "I am engaged and interested in my daily activities." In the present sample, the reliability of the FL scale was 0.90.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Anxious-depressive symptoms -</head><p>The anxious-depressive symptoms score (ADS) was assessed by calculating a sum score based on the 18 items from the Adults Self-Report Anxious-Depressed Syndrome Scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Achenbach &amp; Rescorla, 2003)</ref>. The responses were given on a three-point Likert scale: (1) "Not at all", (2) "somewhat or sometimes", and (3) "very much or so often". An example item was: "I worry about my future". In the present sample, the reliability of the ADS scale was 0.92.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Time spent on different social media platforms (SMUt) -was assessed by calculating the</head><p>sum value of the responses obtained separately for five different social media platforms -Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Twitter, and LinkedIn. The exact item used in this study was: "How much time do you spend on '[PLATFORM NAME]'?". The response options were on a 6-point Likert scale: 1-"never", 2-"less than 30 minutes", 3-"30 to 60 minutes", 4-"1 to 2 hours", 5-"2 to 3 hours", 6-"more than 3 hours".</p><p>The frequency of posting on social media (SMUf) -was measured by a single item: "How often do you post on social media?" The response options were on a 6-point Likert scale: (1) "Never", (2) "once every couple of months", (3) "once every couple of weeks", (4) "weekly", (5) "daily", ( <ref type="formula">6</ref>) "multiple times a day". We merged the categories (5) "daily" and ( <ref type="formula">6</ref>) "multiple times a day" with each other as the responses provided for these categories (149 and 39) were considerably lower than the other categories (which were 1330, 1704, 1081, 396 from "1" to "4", respectively). The new category was labelled as ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>) "daily".</p><p>The number of social media accounts (SMUn) was measured by a single item. The exact item used in this study was: "On how many social media channels do you have an account (e.g., Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn, not Whatsapp)?". The participants were allowed to respond through one of the eight following options: "0", "1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8 or more". We merged the last 2 answer categories ("7", and "8 or more") with the response category "6" given the number of individuals who selected these last two answer categories was noticeably more limited (25 and 87, respectively) than the responses to other categories (which were 361, 810, 1058, 748, 356, 119 from "0" to "6", respectively).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analyses</head><p>Twin models leverage the differences in the degree of relatedness between monozygotic twin pairs (sharing 100% of the segregating genes) and dizygotic twin pairs (sharing on average 50%) to decompose the variance of a phenotype and the covariance between phenotypes in genetic and environmental variance/covariances. Additive genetic variance (A) indicates the proportion of variance that can be explained by the effect of independent alleles on the phenotype. Non-additive genetic variance (D) indicates the proportion of variance explained by interactions between alleles at the same locus (dominance) or between alleles from different loci (epistasis). Environmental variance consists of environmental variance shared by members of the same family (C), and a unique environment component (E) including individual-specific environmental influences and measurement error.</p><p>In the classical twin model, models are not identified when both the C and D variance components are included, therefore a decision has to be made based on observed data and/or results from previous studies. In the observed data, if the cross-twin-cross-trait correlations for MZ twins are more than 2 times the correlations for DZ twins (i.e., rMZ &gt; 2*rDZ), this is an indication of dominant genetic effects, whereas if the opposite is true (i.e., rMZ &lt; 2*rDZ), shared environment effects are more plausible.</p><p>We first estimated phenotypic correlations, twin correlations, and cross-twin crosstrait with a saturated model using the OpenMx package <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Boker et al., 2011)</ref> in R (R Core <ref type="bibr">Team, 2000)</ref>. We treated missing values in our data using the Full Information Maximum Likelihood (FIML) method. In the saturated model, we included all of the eight phenotypic variables, namely the four wellbeing scores, one anxious-depressive symptom score, and the three social media use scores. Age was included as a covariate on means given the presence of age differences in social media use <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Datareportal, 2023)</ref>. The age variable was divided by 100 to facilitate model estimation, which means that the regression coefficients are expressed in centuries. Sex is known to be a potential moderator for explaining the associations between WB/ADS and SMU <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Kelly et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Nesi &amp; Prinstein, 2015)</ref>. However, in the present study, the sample size was too small for testing sex differences; therefore, sex was only included as a covariate on means, similar to age.</p><p>Overall, our analyses were based on two zygosity groups (MZ and DZ twins). First, for each phenotype, we tested in a univariate model whether the assumption of equal means and variances for the oldest and youngest twins and for the MZ and the DZ twins held. All versions of the saturated models, with a unique set of equality constraints on various parameters, were compared to the initial saturated model without any of the constraints. These comparisons were made using the chi-square (χ2) difference test. If the model fit changes significantly by introducing constraints/making the model more parsimonious (by finding significant χ2 difference test results at p &lt; 0.01), this indicates the specifically tested assumption in the constrained model was successfully met. In addition, we utilised the AIC values between the models for comparison for both nested and non-nested models to assess model fit (smaller values indicated better fit). After checking the classical twin model assumptions, we estimated cross-twin cross-trait correlations in an 8-variate saturated model, with sex and age as the covariates on the means.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cholesky model</head><p>Based on the cross-twin cross-trait correlations, we applied a Cholesky decomposition to decompose the phenotypic covariance matrix into genetic and environmental (co)variance components. Following the estimation of the Cholesky model, we proceeded with fitting a series of nested models by fixing the parameters for A and/or C (co)variance components to zero and comparing the log-likelihood values of the restricted models with the non-restricted models. Overall, we tested an ACE, AE, CE, and an E model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Common pathway model</head><p>In addition to the Cholesky model, the genetic and environmental effects can be modelled into common and specific factors in a common pathway (CP) model. More specifically, the CP model allows different phenotypes to be defined as indicators of a single or multiple latent factor(s), for which genetic and environmental variances can be estimated.</p><p>In addition, variance components unique (i.e., independent of the common factor(s)) to each phenotype can be estimated (phenotype-specific/unique effects). In the CP model, a WB and an SMU common factor were specified. The WB factor is comprised of our WB wellbeing indicators and the ADS indicator (negatively weighted). The SMU factor is comprised of the three SMU variables (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>). To make comparisons between the nested models, we used the chi-square difference tests.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>The current study investigated the underlying sources of overlap between wellbeing (WB), anxious-depressive symptoms (ADS), and social media use (SMU) leveraging data from a large population-based twin sample. Consistent with the literature, we found small or no associations between WB/ADS and SMU variables. Social media use was heritable with estimates as high as 72% when measured through time spent daily on social media. The small but statistically significant associations between WB/ADS and SMU seemed to be due to overlapping genetic factors that influence both WB/ADS and SMU. The strong phenotypic relationship between time spent on social media and posting frequency also manifested in their genetic and environmental correlations.</p><p>The phenotypic correlation between SMUt and SMUf (r = 0.64) was primarily driven by additive genetic factors (80%), and the remaining part of the correlation can be explained by non-shared environmental influences. On the contrary, SMUn's phenotypic correlations with SMUt (r = 0.37) and SMUf (r = 0.32) were less strongly influenced by additive genetic factors (63% and 55%, respectively) but more by non-shared environmental influences (about 37% and 45%, respectively).</p><p>We found strong genetic correlation between SMUt and SMUf (r = 0.82), which indicated strong overlap in genetic influences on these SMU variables. On the other hand, SMUn had smaller genetic correlations with SMUt and SMUf (r = 0.48 and 0.42), indicating a smaller overlap with the other two SMU variables. We did not find strong environmental correlations among any of the SMU variables (r = ranging from 0.26 to 0.37) which indicated overlap in environmental influences were limited for these variables. These findings indicate that any intervention or prevention effort to limit the number of social media accounts will likely not generalize to time spent on social media and posting frequency. Alternatively, interventions to limit time spent on social media and posting frequency may have a greater chance of success due to their larger (genetic) overlap with each other, when the aim is to limit (problematic) amounts of social media use.</p><p>We found heritability estimates of 72% for SMUt (CI 95% = between 68% -75%), 32% for SMUn (25% -38%) and 54% for SMUf (50% -59%). Our results resembled the results of the only study on the heritability of SMU, which found a heritability estimate of 40% (6-73%) for using social media to communicate with family members in other households and a heritability estimate of 67% (39-96%) for using social media to communicate with friends <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(York, 2017)</ref>. The present study expands the evidence by finding similar heritability estimates for broader operationalizations of social media use not limited to using social media for specific motivations. We, for example, found individuals in the present study's sample report a wide range of motivations for using social media, such as "to follow the news," or "to be inspired", among others (see Supplementary Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">S4</ref>).</p><p>In general, our findings for the heritability of SMU showed that individuals may have different genetic liabilities which may result in very diverse social media use habits. This information can be utilized to explain differences in social media use both across different individuals but also across different families. Relatedly, the social media usage patterns of parents can be used to better understand the social media use of the children and adolescents. This is because parent and offspring's social media behaviour could be subject to shared genetic influences. Such information from the parents can be particularly useful for setting realistic goals in terms of determining the efficacy of interventions in which the aim is to decrease excessive amount of social media use, also referred to as "addictive social media use" <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Andreassen et al., 2017)</ref>. In addition to this, especially in adolescent target groups, interventions that primarily focus on leveraging within-family-based support to control addictive social media use might be less effective, as familial genetic predisposition might play a role in developing (problematic) patterns of social media use.</p><p>In the present study, 7 out of 15 phenotypic correlations between WB/ADS and SMU were statistically significant, yet very small (rs between 0.03 and 0.10). These results align with meta-review studies for wellbeing and illbeing variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Orben, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Parry et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Valkenburg, 2022)</ref> which have reported similar small or null associations between WB/ADS and SMU, underlining the potentially complex nature of the associations between these variables. Although strong claims are often made on the negative effects of social media use on wellbeing (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Haidt, 2024)</ref>, these are not substantiated in the current study.</p><p>Looking into these associations in more detail, we found that different WB measures manifested different correlations with SMU depending on the specific WB measure. Specifically, flourishing was positively associated with having more social media accounts (SMUn) and spending more time on social media (SMUt). The other WB measures were not related to having more social media accounts. Moreover, the signs of the associations between flourishing and the SMU variables were positive, whereas the other WB variables related to the SMU variables negatively. For instance, higher hedonic wellbeing levels negatively correlated with spending more time on social media (SMUt) and more frequently posting on social media (SMUf).</p><p>As the associations between WB/ADS and SMU variables were very small, they require caution when interpreting them. Nonetheless, it could be speculated that individuals with higher flourishing levels combine the use of more social media channels to utilize the unique advantages or the properties that each platform may offer (for instance, one platform can be better at following work related updates). The same individuals may also spend more time on social media, yet they do not post more frequently. This may indicate that higher flourishing might be associated with a more passive way of engaging with social media as opposed to more active ways such as posting. This is in line with the evidence that adolescents who flourish may spend more time on social media, but do not report themselves as 'oversharing their activities' compared to the general, 'neither flourishing nor languishing' group of users <ref type="bibr">(Law et al., 2019)</ref>. In contrast, lower hedonic wellbeing levels may be related to spending more time on social media and posting more frequently without combining the use of multiple social media platforms. This finding is partly supported by previous evidence suggesting that oversharing on social media and dysfunctional amounts of social media use to be related to lower wellbeing levels in adolescents <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Shabahang et al., 2024)</ref>. Given the small overall correlation pattern, our interpretations of the present results have to be verified by future research.</p><p>The phenotypic correlations between WB/ADS and SMU (which were generally smaller than absolute r = 0.1) that were statistically significant were largely determined by additive genetic factors (between 80-90%). Given the (very) small phenotypic correlations between WB/ADS and SMU the covariance estimates for the genetic and environmental influences should be interpreted with care. We found that both quality of life and ADS had statistically significant genetic correlations with SMUt and SMUf (r = -0.12 and -0.17 for quality of life; r = 0.10 and 0.23 for ADS). No significant environmental correlations were found between WB/ADS and SMU variables. Therefore, although the evidence suggests increased social media use may be related to decreased wellbeing or mood <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Appel et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr">Valkenburg, Beyens, et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr">Valkenburg, Meier, et al., 2022)</ref>, these associations may not be causal but (partly) due to genetic confounding. Overall, any potential intervention aimed to increase wellbeing by the means of decreasing social media use will likely not be very successful due to their small phenotypic correlations. Nevertheless, some individuals may be genetically predisposed to use more social media and at the same predisposed to lower levels of wellbeing and lower levels of depressive symptoms. Therefore, interventions to increase wellbeing through limiting social media use may be more effective for some individuals compared to others due the genetic overlap between the two variables.</p><p>In addition to our Cholesky decomposition, we applied a common pathway model with two latent factors (WB and SMU) to obtain a more overarching view of common and unique influences. No statistically significant genetic correlation was found between the common WB and SMU factors. Potentially, this was due to the common factor model assuming a single genetic correlation estimate between all WB/ADS and SMU variables, muddling significant with non-significant and positive with negative signed genetic correlations at the indicator level.</p><p>In the common pathway model, it was also clear that SMUt and SMUf were more similar to each other than to SMUn, as indicated by larger influences of the common genetic factor. Taken together with the high phenotypic and genetic correlations between SMUt and SMUf, these results may indicate that SMUt cannot be considered a passive SMU measure given its considerable phenotypic and genetic correlation with SMUf (posting frequency), which is clearly an active SMU measure. In addition, SMUn seems to be more distinct from SMUt and SMUf. Since the SMU variables showed different (genetic) associations with each other and with the WB/ADS variables, future studies may want to include different SMU measures because they seem to capture different (genetic) aspects of mental health.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations</head><p>In the present study, we had certain limitations. First, the present sample size did not allow for testing quantitative and qualitative sex differences. However, we included sex as a covariate to account for its influence on mean levels of WB/ADS and SMU. Second, the data from the present study were cross-sectional, making it impossible to make claims regarding the direction of causation between the variables. Fourth, our study employed the classical twin design, which has a series of assumptions (such as not modelling existing geneenvironment correlations) <ref type="bibr">(Derks et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Kendler et al., 1993)</ref>. In the present study, we tested for equal mean and variances between twin siblings, and MZ and DZ twins for each of the phenotypes. However, we did not test for random mating, the equal environment assumption, or whether there were any gene-environment correlations, and gene-environment interactions present in the data. Among these unmodeled potential interplays, geneenvironment interactions and gene-environment correlations can cause the overestimation of A and E variances, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Little, 2013)</ref>. Furthermore, the presence of assortative mating, if not modelled, causes underestimated A and overestimated C variances <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Little, 2013)</ref>. Although we did not test the equal environments assumption, it usually holds for many phenotypes <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Willoughby et al., 2023)</ref>. Fifth, our sample was from the Netherlands; therefore, the heritability estimates found for each phenotype may differ in other cultures, as it was found for other behavioural variables such as personality <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Jang et al., 2006)</ref>. Future research should replicate these findings in samples from other cultures and populations. Lastly, the distribution of the variables ADS and SMUt showed signs of being positively skewed (the lowest scores were the most frequently present in the dataset). As a part of our pre-registered post-hoc analysis plan, we have repeated our main analyses, with the transformed values for ADS and SMUt .The results revealed that our heritability estimates did not significantly change as the confidence intervals between the original and post-hoc heritability estimates overlapped with one another (see Supplementary Table <ref type="table">S5</ref> and<ref type="table">S6</ref>, for the post-hoc estimates).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Concluding remarks</head><p>The present study employed a classical twin design based on a population-based sample to explore the underlying sources of overlap between wellbeing, anxious-depressive symptoms, and social media use. Our results confirmed the small associations between social media use and wellbeing/anxious-depressive symptoms in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Appel et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr">Valkenburg, Beyens, et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr">Valkenburg, Meier, et al., 2022)</ref>, and suggested these associations to be partly driven by overlapping genetic factors. Further, we showed general social media use to be heritable as high as 72%. Given our findings, we encourage researchers and experts to consider more personalized approaches when considering the association between wellbeing and social media use intensity, as well as when understanding the reasons for individuals' use of social media use itself.
