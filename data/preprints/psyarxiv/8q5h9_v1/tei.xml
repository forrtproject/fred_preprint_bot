<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Automated video interviews powered by artificial intelligence (AI) are increasingly being adopted by employers to screen job candidates despite concerns regarding the humanity and transparency of AI. Accordingly, researchers and practitioners advocate overcoming these concerns by refining AI interfaces in terms of tangibility, immediacy, and transparency. However, AI video interviews featuring different interfaces may impact interviewees' tendencies to engage in impression management behaviors (IMs), which can either improve or impair personnel selection validity. This study addressed calls for research to investigate the issues mentioned above by conducting a field study to explore the ways in which AI and AI interfaces affect candidates' IMs in asynchronous video interviews (AVIs). We developed three AVI interfaces and measured real job applicants' self-reported IMs across four experimental treatments. We found that different AI interfaces could increase or decrease candidates' honest IMs and deceptive IMs in different ways. An exploratory analysis also found that candidates' interview anxiety could be mitigated by an AI interface.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>According to Harvard Business Review, up to 86% of employers have adopted automated video interviews powered with artificial intelligence (AI) to screen their job candidates <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Jaser et al., 2022)</ref>. Different from traditional interviews that rely on face-to-face interaction, phone interviews, or synchronous video interviews (SVIs) (e.g., Microsoft Teams, Skype, WebEx, Zoom), such automated video interviews rely on two essential components: asynchronous video interview platforms (AVIs) and AI algorithms.</p><p>AVIs refer to one-way interviews where candidates respond to questions while being recorded on a webcam, which interviewers can review at a later time <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Lukacik et al., 2022)</ref>.</p><p>Additionally, the rise of AI applications has led to the inclusion of AI algorithms in AVIs to aid in hiring recommendations <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Langer et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">2019ab)</ref>. Known as AI-powered AVIs (AI-AVIs), these interviews use a combination of acoustic and image recognition along with machine learning to evaluate candidates' verbal, paraverbal, and nonverbal communication cues. This helps employers screen job applicants during the initial stage of personnel selection <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Hickman et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Su et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>Although the use of AI-AVIs is rising in the post-COVID era <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Kim and Heo, 2022)</ref>, "no humanity" and "no transparency" are concerns about applying this technology in hiring <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Jaser et al., 2022)</ref>. Accordingly, some AI-AVI vendors endow the tools with interfaces of anthropomorphism and transparency (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Glikson and Woolley, 2020)</ref> to diminish concerns. For example, job candidates can see a human-like virtual agent and perceive tangibility in Robot <ref type="bibr">Vera (ai.robotvera.com)</ref>. Job candidates can obtain responses from a chatbot in the same manner as human communication online and can experience immediacy by way of Paradox Olivia <ref type="bibr">Suen, H. Y., &amp; Hung, K.

However, there is still insufficient understanding of how job candidates present themselves differently across AI interfaces in AI-AVI.</p><p>During employment interviews, job seekers aim to present themselves in a favorable light to influence the interviewer's evaluation and increase their chances of receiving a job offer <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Swider et al., 2016)</ref>. This communication strategy is known as impression management <ref type="bibr">(IM)</ref> and can be honest or deceptive, with the latter involving faking or dishonesty <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Amaral et al., 2019)</ref>. While honest IM may enhance selection validity, deceptive IM can introduce bias into hiring decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Bourdage et al., 2018)</ref>. Previous studies have indicated that experienced interviewers struggle to detect and identify interviewees' IM behaviors (IMs), which can distort or inflate interview evaluation <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Roulin et al., 2015)</ref>. This effect holds even in highly structured interviews <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Amaral et al., 2019)</ref>.

Therefore, it is crucial for both scholars and practitioners to determine whether job candidates exhibit different IMs during AI video interviews since these behaviors can significantly affect hiring decisions and introduce biases <ref type="bibr">(Langer et al., 2019a)</ref>, thereby altering employers' selection validity <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Basch et al., 2020)</ref>. As a result, studies on human-AI interactions have called for research on job candidates' self-presentation <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Jalagat and Aquino, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Treem et al., 2020)</ref> and digital personnel selection interviews <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Basch et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr">Nørskov et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Roulin et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>As mentioned, AI-AVI is characterized by AVI, AI, and AI interfaces. AVI involves the automatic software-based interview process (as opposed to SVI, which is conducted by human interviewers via video conference software). AI involves the complete or partial evaluation of interviewee performance using AI algorithms. AI interfaces can have various features, such as tangibility, immediacy, and transparency <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Suen and Hung, 2023)</ref>. This study aims to investigate the effects of AI-AVI on job candidates' IMs, specifically 1) whether job candidates exhibit different honest/deceptive IMs in an AI-based AVI than in a non-AI-based AVI (AI-AVI vs. non-AI-AVI) and 2) whether job candidates exhibit different honest/deceptive IMs across AI interfaces with or without tangibility, immediacy, and transparency in the AI-AVI.</p><p>To address these research questions, the authors created AI interfaces to represent tangibility using a 2-D affinitive avatar designed based on anthropomorphism principles <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">(Waytz et al., 2014)</ref> and uncanny valley theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Mori, 1970)</ref>.

It seeks to discern the effects of AI-AVI on candidates' IMs, particularly examining differences in honest versus deceptive IMs between AI-based and non-AI-based AVIs. The research also evaluates how IMs vary across AI interfaces with features such as tangibility, immediacy, and transparency. Through four experimental studies in real hiring scenarios, the influence of different AI-AVI conditions on candidates' self-reported IMs was assessed.</p><p>As the use of AI-AVI in personnel selection becomes increasingly prevalent, there are growing concerns about its transparency and human touch. While the advantages of AI-AVI are clear, there remains a significant research gap in discerning how candidates' self-presentation shifts across varied AI interfaces. Our study seeks to bridge this gap by delving deep into the intricacies of IMs within AI-AVI, with a particular focus on interfaces defined by tangibility, immediacy, and transparency. Through our rigorous real-world experiments, we aim to elucidate which AI interview interfaces can foster candidates' honest IM behaviors while mitigating deceptive behaviors, thereby enhancing the integrity of the hiring process. <ref type="bibr">Suen, H.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">2 Background and Hypotheses</head><p>In the context of job interviews, candidates often prioritize creating a favorable impression, sometimes even over presenting themselves truthfully, to enhance their chances of being hired <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Hartwell et al., 2019)</ref>. This process, known as IMs, involves conscious or subconscious efforts to control the perceptions others have of them <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Goffman, 1959</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">, Marcus, 2009)</ref>. IMs can be broadly categorized into two types: honest and deceptive. Honest IMs, as identified by <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Bourdage et al. (2018)</ref>, involve genuine self-presentation tactics such as honest self-promotion (showcasing qualifications attractively), honest ingratiation (genuinely complimenting the employer or interviewer), and honest defensiveness (describing actions taken to avert negative outcomes). In contrast, deceptive IMs, as categorized by <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Levashina and Campion (2007)</ref>, involve tactics such as slight image creation (presenting a slightly embellished image), extensive image creation (crafting a completely false image), image protection (omitting negative information), and dishonest ingratiation (pleasing the interviewer irrespective of the actual selection criteria).</p><p>Notably, certain IM tactics, such as honest and dishonest ingratiation, are not applicable in situations where no interviewer is present, such as in AVIs, and were thus excluded from this study.</p><p>The efficacy of honest IMs in forecasting job performance is acknowledged, yet its influence on the hiring process is still a matter of debate <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">(Wilhelmy et al., 2021)</ref>.

Employers can view the recorded responses at any time <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Lukacik et al., 2022)</ref>.

However, if a candidate is unsure about how an AI assesses their interview performance in an AI-AVI environment, honest and deceptive IMs may not differ, as the candidate is unaware of the AI's assessment criteria <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Langer et al., 2020)</ref>. As AI is often perceived as a black box and is challenging for job candidates to understand <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Köchling et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr">Langer et al., 2019b)</ref>, the candidate may not intend to engage in honest or deceptive IMs differently when interacting with an AI-AVI without any associated tangibility, immediacy, or transparency interfaces or when speaking to a void in a non-AI-AVI. Based on this, the following hypotheses are proposed:</p><p>Hypothesis 1-1: Interviewees' honesty IMs do not significantly differ between AI-AVIs without tangibility, immediacy, or transparency and non-AI-AVIs.</p><p>Hypothesis 1-2: Interviewees' deceptive IMs do not significantly differ between AI-AVIs without tangibility, immediacy, or transparency and non-AI-AVIs.</p></div>

Therefore, in automated video interviews, interviewees tend to respond to computer interfaces with humanizing features in the same manner as they would to humans <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Gerich, 2012)</ref>, including both honest and deceptive IMs <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Langer et al., 2020)</ref>. Given the increasing integration of AI in various domains, <ref type="bibr">Shareef et al. Suen, H. Y., &amp; Hung, K. E. (2024)</ref>. Revealing the influence of AI and its interfaces on job candidates' honest and deceptive impression management in asynchronous video interviews. Technological <ref type="bibr">Forecasting and Social Change, 198, 123011.</ref> <ref type="url" target="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.techfore.2023.123011">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.techfore.2023.123011</ref> 9 (2023) underscored the significance of machine autonomy and social interaction in shaping human actions. This underscores the relevance of our research examining the effects of AI interview interfaces on the behaviors of job candidates. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Glikson and Woolley (2020)</ref> suggest that there are various embodiments of AI, including AI-enabled robots, AI-enabled virtual agents, and embedded AI applications. In the context of AI-AVIs, virtual agents (e.g., Vera.ai) and embedded AI (e.g., HireVue.com) are commonly used as commercial solutions to evaluate job candidates and provide hiring decision support <ref type="bibr">(Suen et al., 2019a)</ref>. These AI interfaces may possess human-like features such as tangibility, immediacy, and transparency <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Glikson and Woolley, 2020)</ref>. Tangibility refers to AI's ability to be perceived or touched by audiences and its ability to touch another human <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Liu and London, 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Immediacy behaviors determine the interpersonal closeness perceived by audiences through AI's nonverbal responsiveness and human interaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Kreps and Neuhauser, 2013)</ref>. Transparency involves audiences understanding what and how AI assesses and decides things, as well as the rules and logic behind it <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Hoff and Bashir, 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Drawing from social interface theory, job candidates tend to exhibit both honest and deceptive IMs when interacting with AI-AVIs that emulate human characteristics, such as tangibility and immediacy. This mirrors their behaviors with human interviewers. <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Shareef et al. (2021)</ref> emphasized that users' inclination to embrace a system is heightened when they feel confident in operating it and when the system exudes a sense of social engagement. Analogously, in AI-mediated interviews, the candidates' behaviors are profoundly shaped by their perceptions of the AI interface, with a particular emphasis on its perceived tangibility and immediacy. <ref type="bibr">Suen, H. Y., &amp; Hung, K. E. (2024)</ref>. Revealing the influence of AI and its interfaces on job candidates' honest and deceptive impression management in asynchronous video interviews. Technological <ref type="bibr">Forecasting and Social Change, 198, 123011.</ref> <ref type="url" target="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.techfore.2023.123011">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.techfore.2023.123011</ref> 10 Research has found that interviewees' self-promotion behaviors are desirable because they can influence human interviewers' judgments and yield better interview ratings <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Amaral et al., 2019)</ref>. As a result, interviewees exhibit greater levels of honest IMs when AI interfaces possess human-like features such as tangibility or immediacy compared to when they do not possess such features in AI-AVIs. The following hypotheses are thus postulated: In line with the faking likelihood model in employment interviews <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Levashina and Campion, 2006)</ref>, interviewees are less likely to engage in deceptive IMs when they perceive a higher risk of detection. The introduction of AI in AVIs adds a layer of complexity to this dynamic. Drawing from the concept of 'social presence' as introduced by <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Short, Williams, and Christie (1976)</ref>, certain media can evoke a sense of tangibility and immediacy, making users feel as if they are in the presence of another sentient being. Their work posits that the richer the medium, the higher the social presence, and consequently, the more 'real' the interaction feels. In the context of AI-AVIs, when an AI interface exhibits human-like characteristics, such as tangibility or immediacy, it can significantly enhance the perceived social presence. As a result, interviewees might feel as if they are being observed more closely, even if it is by a machine.

This heightened awareness, coupled with the AI's human-like characteristics, could amplify their perception of being scrutinized, making deceptive IMs seem more transparent and riskier. Consequently, this could lead to a decline in deceptive behaviors during interviews (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Law et al., 2016)</ref>. Thus, we propose the following: Despite AI transparency being required by stakeholders to promote fairness, trust, and legal compliance, intentional opacity may also be required to avoid users gaming AI modeling and rules <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Langer and König, 2023)</ref>.

Many AI-AVI vendors try to overcome these concerns by redesigning and refining their AI interfaces, such as tangibility, immediacy, and transparency.</p><p>However, whether AI interfaces alleviate or aggravate IM is another concern for employment interviews, especially for the types of job interviewees' IMs that may impair selection validity.</p><p>This field study addresses the call for research <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Basch et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Jalagat and Aquino, 2022</ref>;</p><p>Suen, H.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Key Findings and Insights</head><p>Our research reveals that the absence of three human-like interfaces in an AI-AVI does not significantly alter job candidates' IMs compared to a non-AI-AVI. Echoing the observations of <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Bill and Melchers (2023)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Köchling et al. (2022)</ref>, candidates might view AI as distinctly nonhuman, potentially accounting for the minimal behavioral variance observed. When an AI-AVI embodies tangibility through an avatar, there is a notable rise in candidates' honest IMs and a decline in deceptive IMs. This suggests that the AI, when personified, is perceived as a virtual interviewer capable of discerning and evaluating IMs.</p><p>Conversely, when an AI-AVI manifests immediacy via a chatbot, honest IMs amplify, but deceptive IMs remain unchanged. This could be attributed to the AI being seen as a supportive entity or partner, aiding candidates in genuine self-presentation, as opposed to an overseeing entity that might scrutinize deceptive behaviors. Additionally, candidates tend to feel less anxious interacting with an immediate AI, possibly viewing it as a collaborative tool rather than a judgmental overseer.</p><p>Last, when AI-AVI offers transparency through preinterview text explanations, there is a decline in honest IMs and a surge in deceptive IMs. This might stem from candidates' attempts to exploit the system, emphasizing certain criteria while downplaying others, thereby reducing their focus on genuine self-promotion and defensiveness, which may not align with the AI's assessment parameters (such as personality traits in these studies).</p><p>Suen, H.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Academic Implications</head><p>Anchored in the foundational frameworks of job candidates' IMs, the propensity for faking in employment interviews, social interface theory, and AI interface classification, our research carves out distinct academic advancements. First, we augment the existing interviewee performance model <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Huffcutt et al., 2011)</ref>, pinpointing and addressing nuances specific to the automated video interview landscape <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Hickman et al., 2022)</ref>. Moreover, our exploration delves deeply into the factors that drive individuals to engage in deceptive behaviors during interviews, particularly when navigating interactions with AI-driven interview platforms <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Levashina and Campion, 2006)</ref>.</p><p>A standout contribution of our work is the intricate examination of transparency dynamics within AI video interviews. We caution against the unchecked advocacy for AI transparency, positing that it might inadvertently pave the way for candidates to strategize and exploit AI evaluations, thereby diluting the authenticity of the interview outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Langer and König, 2023)</ref>. In doing so, we also heed the academic call to understand the ripple effects of interview transparency on candidate behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Levashina et al., 2014)</ref>.</p><p>In essence, our rigorous empirical approach not only deepens the comprehension of human-AI interplay but also enriches the discourse on IM strategies within the AI-AVI context, extending the narrative on user-centric AI paradigms (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Kim and Im, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Nørskov et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr">Langer et al., 2019b)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Practical Implications</head><p>Suen, H. Y., &amp; Hung, K. E. (2024). Revealing the influence of AI and its interfaces on job candidates' honest and deceptive impression management in asynchronous video interviews. Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 198, 123011. <ref type="url" target="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.techfore.2023.123011">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.techfore.2023.123011</ref> 29 Our research offers indispensable insights that hold significant ramifications for practitioners, especially those involved in automated video interview platforms. First, a pivotal discovery from our study is the neutrality of AI in AVIs concerning candidates' IMs. Regardless of candidates' awareness of AI evaluations, their propensity for honest or deceptive IMs remains</p><p>unchanged. This underscores the robustness of AI-driven processes, ensuring that the integrity of the selection process remains uncompromised.</p><p>Moreover, we present a compelling case for the integration of a 2D cartoon avatar in AI-AVIs. Such a representation not only humanizes the AI but also fosters an environment where candidates are more inclined toward genuine self-presentation, thereby enhancing the overall validity of the selection process.</p><p>Furthermore, our recommendation to incorporate a text-based chatbot augmented with a voice tracking feature is grounded in its potential to amplify candidates' honesty and simultaneously mitigate any interview-related apprehensions. This ensures a more authentic and comfortable interview experience for the candidates.</p><p>Last, while the discourse around AI often leans heavily toward transparency, our findings advocate for a more nuanced approach. Embracing intentional opacity can serve as a deterrent against deceptive behaviors, promoting a more authentic self-presentation. Consequently, we advise against overclarifying AI assessment rules to candidates before an automated video interview, resonating with the established stance against excessive transparency in traditional face-to-face interviews <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(König et al., 2007)</ref>.</p></div>

Revealing the influence of AI and its interfaces on job candidates' honest and deceptive impression management in asynchronous video interviews.</p><p>Technological <ref type="bibr">Forecasting and Social Change, 198, 123011.</ref> <ref type="url" target="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.techfore.2023.123011">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.techfore.2023.123011</ref> </p><p>There are several avenues for future research to address the limitations of this study. First, although we tried to response bias by incorporating a safeguard in the participation invitation <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Powell et al., 2021)</ref>, self-reported IMs might still be susceptible to bias. Future research could employ machine learning models to detect IMs from interviewees' facial expressions rather than relying solely on self-report measures (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Monaro et al., 2022)</ref>.</p><p>Second, our study was conducted in a jurisdiction where the use of AI video interviews in employment selection was not legally restricted. Future research should replicate our experiments in different contexts that have varying laws, levels of user acceptance, and digital maturity for AI-AVIs.</p><p>Last, our findings are constrained by our specific interface designs, which might influence user behaviors differently. Future research could explore crafting varied avatar images or robots with distinct emotional expressions to showcase tangibility (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Nørskov et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Şengün et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Tastemirova et al., 2022)</ref>. They could also use natural language processing (NLP) to create AI chatbots that exude immediacy (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Baabdullah et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Balakrishnan et al., 2022)</ref> or design varied interpretable messages to highlight transparency (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Haque et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">John-Mathews, 2022)</ref>. Furthermore, this study did not explore the interaction effects between different interface attributes. For instance, whether the combination of tangible AI with immediacy has a distinct impact on interviewees' behaviors is a direction worth investigating in future research.</p><p>The emergence of AVIs and AI has significantly impacted how employers screen job candidates, resulting in significant changes personnel selection <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Allal-Chérif et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Gonzalez et al., 2022)</ref>. However, an important issue that arises from this transformation is the impact of automated video interviews on the actual IMs of job candidates.</p><p>The field study provides vital insights into the ways in which AI and its interfaces impact job candidates' IMs in an AVI. The study revealed various impacts of AI tangibility, immediacy, and transparency on candidates' IMs and interview anxiety. As a result, AVI vendors and users may wish to consider redesigning and refining their AI interfaces to enhance personnel selection validity. We are confident that our study will encourage further research into these critical human-AI social interactions, leading to more profound insights into the impact of AI on personnel selection and decision-making.</p><p>Suen, H.
