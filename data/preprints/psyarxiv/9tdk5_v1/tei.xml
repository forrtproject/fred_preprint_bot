<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The study aimed to determine if the pain assessment skills of the individual being observed influence observationally induced placebo effects in pain. Participants were randomly assigned to two experimental groups and one control group. In the experimental groups, participants observed the responses to the placebo of a model who had previously shown either high accuracy (high-accuracy group) or low accuracy (lowaccuracy group) in differentiating the intensity of pain stimuli. The model exhibited less pain in response to pain stimuli when a placebo was administered, and more pain when no placebo was given.

Pain-related expectations of the participants were also measured. Observational learning caused a form of nocebo hyperalgesia in the participants, leading to an increase in pain in a context that had previously accompanied the model's heightened pain sensations.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Over the past decade, research has shown that social factors contribute to the formation of placebo effects in pain <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42]</ref>. These results indicate that pain relief (i.e., placebo hypoalgesia and analgesia) or pain amplification (i.e., nocebo hyperalgesia) following placebo intervention might result from prior observation of an analogous response of another person to a placebo.</p><p>Observational learning (OBL) effects are partially based on the observed model's attributes. Previous studies have shown that certain characteristics of the model, such as their sex <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>, self-confidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, and social status <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, can contribute to the magnitude of observationally induced placebo and nocebo effects in pain. However, OBL appears beneficial when the observed person is perceived as having the skills to perform a given task in a given situation effectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49]</ref>. Observing such a skilled model can increase situation predictability and raise the observer's self-efficacy, thus promoting learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47]</ref>. The current study investigated whether the model's perceived accuracy in differentiating between pain stimuli of different intensities can influence the observers' responses to placebo. The model perceived as having poor pain assessment skills (i.e., low-accuracy model) may generate lesscertain pain-related expectations in the observer than the model with such skills (i.e., high-accuracy model), thus contributing to weaker placebo responses. Based on the aforementioned data, we hypothesized that observing a model would elicit placebo hypoalgesia in observers (H1) and that a high-accuracy model would elicit a greater placebo effect than a low-accuracy model (H2).</p><p>Although pain-related expectations have been widely assumed to be involved in placebo effects in pain induced by OBL <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>, their mediating role in shaping these effects has been confirmed only relatively recently <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43]</ref>. One of the aims of the current study was to investigate the role of expectations in shaping placebo responses induced by observing low-and high-accuracy models. We hypothesized that expectations elicited by observing low-and high-accuracy models would mediate the placebo effect (H3).</p><p>Prior studies have suggested that individual characteristics of the observer can contribute to placebo effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref>. Therefore, in the current study the observers' empathy, optimism, fear of pain, sensitivity to bodily signals, and reward responsiveness were measured to explore their associations with the magnitude of the learning effect.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Materials and methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study design</head><p>The study protocol was approved by the Research Ethics Committee (Institute of Psychology, Jagiellonian University, Kraków, Poland, ref. no. KE/24_2021) and was preregistered on the Open Science Framework (<ref type="url" target="https://osf.io/4w8b5">https://osf.io/4w8b5</ref> ). A mixed between-within-subjects randomized study design was applied, in which participants were assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of the experimental groups: 1) high-accuracy group, 2) lowaccuracy group, or 3) control group.</p><p>The experiment consisted of four phases: calibration, baseline, observational learning (OBL), and post-OBL. The OBL phase was conducted only in the experimental groups. It consisted of two stages (stimuli discrimination task and placebo induction), during which participants were shown two videos presenting the same model. The first video aimed to demonstrate the model's ability to discriminate the intensity of two thermal stimuli: participants in the low-accuracy group observed an ineffective model, while participants in the high-accuracy group observed an effective model. The second video showed the model responding with lower pain to thermal stimuli administered with a placebo, and responding with higher pain to stimuli applied without a placebo (see 'Procedure'). An overview of the study's design and procedures can be found in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. and a placebo hypoalgesia induction. In the first video, the model allegedly received two thermal stimuli and rated which one was more intense, providing either 80% correct answers (high-accuracy group) or 20% correct answers (lowaccuracy group). In the second video, the same model rated pain stimuli as weak with a placebo ointment and as strong without a placebo. Participants from the control group watched a control video of fish in an aquarium.</p><p>Note: OBL -observational learning; NRS -11-point Numerical Rating Scale.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>A power calculation for the mixed models was conducted using the superpower Shiny app <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>; <ref type="url" target="https://arcstats.io/shiny/anova-power/">https://arcstats.io/shiny/anova-power/</ref>) for the main effect of interest: a three-way interaction between experimental group (high-accuracy, low-accuracy, control), phase (baseline, post-OBL), and trials (placebo, control), with mean pain rating as a dependent variable. Power was calculated on 2000 simulated datasets for several possible values of the total sample size (i.e., n = 84, n = 96, n = 108, n = 120). The expected change in pain from the baseline to post-OBL in the experimental groups was determined based on prior findings regarding the effects of model characteristics (i.e., sex) on the efficacy of OBL in eliciting placebo effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>: Δ = 0.80 in the high-accuracy model group, Δ = 0.50 in the low-accuracy model group. Within-subject correlations between pain ratings and standard deviations were set at r = 0.80 and SD = 1.03, respectively. It was calculated that a sufficient power level (1-β=0.83) would be achieved with n = 96.</p><p>A total of 96 participants took part in the study, including 60 females (62.5%). Participants were recruited through advertisement websites and posters in various locations at Jagiellonian University. All participants were healthy volunteers aged 18-50 years of age, free of a history of chronic pain and any current or past neurological, psychiatric, or cardiovascular diseases. Volunteers were excluded if they had 1) participated in a pain study before, 2) studied psychology, 3) experienced pain on the day of participation, 4) consumed caffeine or nicotine at least 3 hours, alcohol at least 24 hours, or analgesics or psychoactive drugs 72 hours before their appointment. Each participant gave written informed consent and was compensated financially for their participation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Apparatus and materials</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pain induction</head><p>Pain stimuli were applied to the volar surface of both forearms using two thermodes (active surface of 3x3 cm) connected to the Thermal Sensory Analyzer (TSA-II, Medoc Advanced Medical Systems, Ramat Yishai, Israel). In the course of the experiment, two thermal stimuli that elicited moderate pain were applied. The intensities of the two target thermal stimuli were calculated individually for each participant and separately for each forearm, based on the calibration procedure (see Calibration).</p><p>All stimuli were initiated from 32.0 ⁰C with a rate of temperature rise and fall of 10 °C/s. The target temperature was maintained for 6 seconds.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Placebo ointment</head><p>A neutral, colorless, and odorless ointment (Hasco-Lek, Wrocław, Poland) was used as a placebo. The application of the ointment was done on either the dominant or nondominant forearm, with the allocation counterbalanced among participants.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pain intensity and pain expectation</head><p>Pain intensity and pain expectations were rated on an 11-point Numerical Rating Scale (NRS), ranging from "0" = "no pain" to "10" = "the most intense pain that is tolerable". Pain ratings were collected after each thermal stimulus application, whereas expectations were rated after the baseline, after OBL, and after post-OBL.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Perceived accuracy</head><p>To assess the perceived accuracy of the model and participants' predictions about their own accuracy, participants in the OBL groups were asked to rate on a 0-100 Visual Analog Scale 1) how accurately the model estimated the difference between the stimuli (0% 'not accurate at all'; 100% 'very accurate'); 2) what percentage of the model's estimates were correct ('0% correct estimates'; '100% correct estimates'); 3) how accurate the participant would be when performing a similar task (0 'not accurate at all'; 100 'very accurate'). These questions were asked after the first video (presenting the stimuli discrimination task).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Physiological responses</head><p>The MP-160 hardware system and Acqknowledge v.5.0.2 software were used to collect electrocardiography (ECG) and electrodermal activity (EDA) data during the experiment (BIOPAC systems, Inc., Goleta, CA, USA). In order to prepare participants for ECG, their skin was abraded with Nuprep scrub (Weaver and Company, Aurora, CO, USA). Three disposable Ag/AgCl hydrogel (4% chloride salt) electrodes (Ø 11 mm) were connected to the leads: one each on the participant's left and right lower ribs, and one on the right side of the sternum. To measure the ECG signals, the ECG100D smart amplifier was used (gain x2000, high-pass filter of 1 Hz, low-pass filter of 35 Hz). For EDA, isotonic gel (0.5% chloride salt saline) was used to fill two disposable Ag/AgCi electrodes (gel cavity Ø 16 mm), which were placed on the medial phalanges of the index and middle finger of the non-dominant hand. To measure skin conductance level (SCL) and responses (SCR) to the heat stimuli, the EDA100D smart amplifier was used (low-pass filter of 3 Hz; IIR high-pass 0.5 Hz; cut-off, Q=0.707).</p><p>The PhysioData Toolbox 0.6.3 (Sjak-Shie, 2022) was used for visual inspection of the data and calculations of the data endpoints. Mean heart rate (HR; in bpm) and skin conductance level (SCL; in μS) were calculated for the baseline and post-OBL. In addition, the average skin conductance response amplitude (SCR; in μS) to the administration of the pain stimuli in the baseline and post-OBL was calculated. For SCR, a latency window of 1 to 5 seconds after the thermal stimulus onset was used.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Psychological traits</head><p>Empathy was measured by means of 1) the Interpersonal Reactivity Index, IRI <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>; Polish adaptation <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, which consists of 22 items divided into three subscales -Empathic Concern, Perspective Taking, and Personal Distress (without Fantasy Scale from the original IRI); 2) 22item version of the Empathy Quotient, EQ short <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>; Polish adaptation <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</p><p>Sensitivity to rewards and punishment was measured by a short form of the Sensitivity to Punishment and Sensitivity to Reward Questionnaire <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>; Polish adaptation <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref>, which consists of 24 items divided into two subscales: Sensitivity to Punishment and Sensitivity to Reward.</p><p>Optimism was assessed by the 10-item Life Orientation Test-Revised, LOT-R <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>; Polish adaptation <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</p><p>Fear of pain was measured by the 30-item Fear of Pain Questionnaire-III, FPQ-III <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>; Polish adaptation <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> with the following subscales: Fear of Severe Pain, Fear of Minor Pain and Fear of Medical Pain.</p><p>Attention to bodily signals was measured on the 16-item Body Attention, Ignorance, and Awareness Scale, BAIAS <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>; Polish translation was made for research purposes by the Pain Research Group), which includes the Body Attention, Body Ignorance, and Body Awareness subscales.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure</head><p>Participants within the experimental groups completed the following phases of the study: calibration, baseline, OBL, and post-OBL.</p><p>Participants in the control group did not undergo the OBL phase, instead watching a control video. After the post-OBL phase, participants from all groups completed the closing survey.</p><p>At the study's outset, participants were informed that the aim of the study was to examine physiological responses during personal pain experiences and while observing others in pain (experimental groups), or during personal pain experiences (control group). After this, sensors measuring physiological functions were attached to the participants.</p><p>Next, thermodes were placed on both forearms, and the pain calibration procedure was started.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Calibration</head><p>The temperatures of stimuli applied to each forearm were determined throughout the calibration. Half of the participants started calibration on the dominant arm, and the other half on the non-dominant arm (counterbalanced across the groups). The calibration procedure consisted of two increasing series of thermal heat stimuli applied to each arm. The first heat stimulus was 40.0 ⁰C, and the temperature of each consecutive stimulus increased by 0.5 ⁰C until the stimulus temperature reached 49.5 ⁰C or the participant rated the intensity of pain elicited by the current heat stimulus as 7 or more on the NRS. The target temperatures that correspond to moderate pain (i.e., pain of intensity rated as 5 and 6 points on NRS) were calculated using an exponential trend line (y = a b*x ) and then applied in subsequent study phases.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Baseline</head><p>The 16 thermal stimuli were applied alternately to both forearms. The thermal stimuli that corresponded to pain ratings 5 and 6 on the NRS were applied in a pseudo-random order (either "5-6-6-5" (x4) or "6-5-5-6" (x4)). On which arm (dominant and non-dominant) and in what order the stimuli were applied depended on the pre-planned counterbalance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>OBL</head><p>Firstly, the ointment was applied to the participants' forearms (the arm on which the ointment was applied was counterbalanced across groups).</p><p>The ointment was applied to a rectangular area on the participant's forearm (4x5 cm) marked with blue tape. Participants received no information on the purported effects of the ointment. If participants asked questions, a standardized answer was provided, emphasizing that the ointment was safe and tested.</p><p>Participants from the experimental groups were notified that they would watch two videos allegedly presenting another participant performing two tasks. Participants were informed that they would subsequently be randomly assigned to undertake one of these tasks; however, in fact, participants were consistently assigned to the second task.</p><p>The videos presented a male model (34 years old) sitting in the same room as the participant. The model had the ointment applied on the same arm as the participant. The recording clearly showed half of the model's face, both arms, and a computer monitor. Participants observed the model undertaking two tasks:</p><p>As part of the accuracy manipulation, the first video presented the model with one thermode attached to the forearm without placebo ointment.</p><p>The model undertook a stimuli discrimination task. He received five sequences of two stimuli and then had to choose which of the stimuli was more intense, subsequently receiving feedback on whether his judgment was correct or incorrect. When an incorrect choice was made, the model's screen displayed red text reading "incorrect," accompanied by a recorded voice stating the same. Conversely, for a correct choice the model's screen presented green text stating "correct," accompanied by a corresponding recorded voice message. Depending on which group the participants were randomized to, they viewed either the model with a high-accuracy rating or a low-accuracy rating. For the group with a model showing high accuracy, 80% of his responses were correct; for the group with a model showing low accuracy, 20% were correct. After the video, participants were asked questions regarding the model's accuracy in differentiating thermal stimuli and were asked to give predictions regarding their own accuracy (for details see "Perceived accuracy") Next, participants were asked to watch the second video, which aimed to induce placebo hypoalgesia. The second video showed the same model with two thermodes attached to his forearms. The model rated the intensity of pain elicited by thermal stimuli applied with and without the placebo; however, in fact, no painful stimuli were applied. When the model allegedly received thermal stimuli on the forearm coated with a placebo ointment, an additional icon representing ointment appeared on the computer screen. The model rated the pain elicited by stimuli applied with a placebo as low (1-3 on the NRS) and without a placebo as high (7-9 on the NRS). The model demonstrated responses to 16 stimuli applied with or without a placebo. The participants received the same sequence of stimuli during the post-OBL.</p><p>Participants in the control group watched a video showing fish in an aquarium; this video ran for the same amount of time as the videos in the OBL groups.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Post-OBL</head><p>During the post-OBL phase, the set of 16 stimuli of moderate intensity (for details see Baseline) was alternately applied to both forearms. When the thermal stimulus was administered to the forearm covered with a placebo ointment, an extra icon depicting ointment appeared on the computer screen.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Closing survey</head><p>To verify whether participants had been involved in observing the model, participants rated 1) how the ointment affected the model's pain and their own pain (on a scale from -5, 'decreased pain', to 5, 'increases pain'), and 2) how much pain the model and participants themselves experienced on average with and without the ointment (0-10 NRS). In addition, participants were asked how the model's pain rating affected their pain perception and how much they tried to adjust their pain ratings to the model's ratings. Participants were also asked to fill out a few questionnaires measuring psychological traits (for details, see Psychological traits).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical analyses</head><p>First, descriptive statistics were calculated for age, BMI, as well as questionnaire scores; a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVAs) was conducted to detect group differences, and the chi square test was carried out to determine if the proportions of men and women as well as righthanded and left-handed participants differed between groups.</p><p>To assess if OBL can induce placebo hypoalgesia regardless of the model's accuracy (H1), a mixed-model repeated-measures ANOVA was conducted on the pain ratings with group (merged OBL groups vs. control) as a between-subjects factor, and trials (placebo, control), as well as phase (baseline, post-OBL) as within-subjects factors (2 x 2 x 2).</p><p>To determine whether the ability of the model to accurately differentiate pain intensity influences the magnitude of placebo hypoalgesia (H2), a second mixed-model repeated-measures ANOVA (3 x 2 x 2) was conducted with group (high-accuracy vs. low-accuracy vs. control) as a between-subjects factor, and trials and phase as within-subjects factors.</p><p>Both ANOVAs were followed by planned comparisons for differences in pain ratings: 1) between groups, in the placebo trials in the post-OBL; 2) within groups, between placebo and control trials in the post-OBL; and 3) within groups, between phases in the placebo trials. The planned comparisons were corrected for the number of comparisons (Bonferroni).</p><p>Parallel analogous analyses were performed for physiological measures (HR, SCL and SCR). Square root transformation (sqr) was applied to SCR and SCL data to normalize their distribution before conducting the parametric analyses. Wherever the sphericity assumption was not met in the repeated-measures ANOVA, the Greenhouse-Geisser correction was applied. When interpreting the effect sizes, it was assumed that η2 = 0.01 indicates a small effect, η2 = 0.06 indicates a medium effect, and η2 = 0.14 indicates a large effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. Sensitivity analysis was conducted to evaluate the impact of participants who suspected the true aim of the study on the results. Mediation analysis was performed to determine whether expectations mediated the effects of OBL (H3) on pain ratings in the experimental groups relative to the control group. In this analysis, group (noobservation vs high-accuracy vs low-accuracy) was treated as an independent variable; the difference in mean expectations ratings between baseline and post-OBL in placebo trials was treated as a mediator, and the difference in mean pain ratings between baseline and post-OBL in placebo trials was treated as a dependent variable. The difference in mean pain ratings between baseline and post-OBL in control trials was controlled for. Mediation analysis was preceded by a mixedmodel, repeated-measures ANOVA conducted on expectations ratings to determine whether the differences in expectations mirrored those in pain ratings. Parallel analyses were conducted for physiological data. The second mediation analysis was performed to explore whether the perceived accuracy of the model mediated the effects of observational learning on pain ratings. Since the correlation between the two measures of the model's accuracy used in the study was very high (r=0.95, p&lt;0.001), we used only one of the measures (how accurately the model estimated the difference between the stimuli) in the mediation analysis.</p><p>The mediation model was constructed similarly as the first one, the difference being that in this analysis the high-accuracy group was compared to the low-accuracy group (independent variable). Biascorrected bootstrap 95% confidence intervals (N = 5000) were used to determine if the indirect effect was significant.</p><p>The associations between interindividual traits and the magnitude of placebo hypoalgesia (operationalized as the pain decrease in placebo trials in experimental groups) induced by observing the models were explored with correlational analyses. Moderation analysis was performed to investigate whether the participants' own accuracy in pain reporting modified placebo hypoalgesia elicited by OBL. The moderator variable was operationalized as the average coefficient of variation for pain ratings during baseline. Similarly to the mediation analyses, the group was treated as an independent variable, the difference between baseline and post-OBL pain ratings in control trials was treated as a covariate, and the change in pain ratings from baseline to post-OBL in placebo trials was treated as a dependent variable.</p><p>A one-way ANOVA followed by pairwise comparisons was conducted to analyze the answers given to the control questions (perceived accuracy and closing questions). IBM SPSS software for Windows version 28 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) was used for all of the analyses. Mediation and moderation analyses were performed using the Process Macro version 4.1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, applying models number 4 (mediation) and number 1 (moderation). The alpha level was set at 0.05 (two-sided tests) for rejection of the null hypothesis in all the statistical analyses.</p></div>

The planned comparisons showed that the OBL groups and the no-observation group did not differ significantly in terms of the mean pain experienced in the placebo trials in post-OBL (p=0.85). Interestingly, the participants from the OBL groups reported a borderline significant increase in baseline to post-OBL pain ratings for placebo trials (p=0.057). Additionally, further exploratory analyses (corrected for all pairwise comparisons) revealed that pain also increased significantly from baseline to post-OBL for control trials in the OBL groups (p&lt;0.001). The difference between pain ratings for placebo and control trials (measured post-OBL) turned out to be significant only within the OBL groups: after observing the model, participants from these groups experienced less pain in the placebo trials relative to the control trials (p=0.012).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>One of the study aims was to induce placebo hypoalgesia through OBL.</p><p>However, participants' responses to stimuli applied with placebo did not decrease due to OBL, and even a slight non-significant increase in pain was observed from baseline to post-OBL. Instead, participants learned to respond with hyperalgesia to stimuli applied without placebo. These data suggest that observers' pain responses were shaped mainly by the hyperalgesic reactions of the observed model that were demonstrated in the non-placebo condition. Similar responses to placebo have also been observed in previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50]</ref>. In these studies, participants reacted with higher pain to the cues associated with the model's more painful responses, but their reactions to pain stimuli preceded by cues associated with the model's hypoalgesic responses did not change from the baseline to post-OBL <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> or did not differ from the reactions of participants who were not subjected to OBL <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>.</p><p>Observer's attention is a critical process of OBL <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, and could explain these results. Attention can be biased toward predictors of aversive outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46]</ref>. In the current experiment, participants observed the model's reactions in two conditions that differed in the level of aversiveness: in the non-placebo condition the model experienced more intense pain than in the placebo condition. It seems that observers' attention was attracted mainly by the contextual cues signaling the absence of placebo (for example, a thermometer icon displayed alone), namely the cues associated with the more aversive condition. As a result, participants learned to respond with greater pain in the absence of the placebo, but they did not learn to respond to the placebo. As the participants felt more pain in a context that had previously accompanied the model's greater pain, it can be assumed that a kind of nocebo hyperalgesia rather than placebo hypoalgesia was elicited in the observers. Since participants in studies on observationally induced placebo effects are usually exposed simultaneously to the model's analgesic and hyperalgesic responses (and thus the cues associated with hyperalgesic responses) <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>, establishing the involvement of OBL in shaping placebo hypoalgesia appears difficult <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>.</p><p>The psychophysiological responses measured during the experiment decreased over time, which seems to result from acclimatization to the experimental environment rather than from the experimental manipulation. As no clear physiological markers of pain have been identified to date <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, it is possible that the physiological changes observed in participants reflected changes in not so much their pain experiences but in their stress levels, or possibly changes in physical activity after traveling to the lab.</p><p>The existing studies suggest that the individual characteristics of the observed person contribute to placebo effects in pain. Participants' perception of the model's social status <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> and self-confidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> have been found to be predictors of placebo hypoalgesia. However, observing a male model demonstrating pain significantly increased the magnitude of nocebo hyperalgesia compared to observing a female model <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>. This indicates that certain model's characteristics, such as sex, have the potential to substantially alter placebo effects. In the current study, only the model perceived as having good pain assessment skills was effective in shaping nocebo hyperalgesia. Thus, it seems that social learning of placebo effects in pain is governed mainly by the characteristics of the model that allow pain predictions. It has been shown that gender-related stereotypes can significantly modulate pain perception <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">58]</ref>.</p><p>According to these stereotypes, males are perceived as less sensitive to pain and less willing to demonstrate pain compared to females. Such a bias might cause a male model's high pain ratings to be perceived as more threatening to the participants themselves. Thus, the sex of the model experiencing pain may be an easily accessible cue that facilitates inferences about the intensity of upcoming pain. Similarly, confidence in the demonstrator's ability to assess pain accurately may increase the reliability of their pain judgments, thus making them good predictors of an aversive event. On the other hand, knowledge about the model's selfconfidence or social status, although related to social learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, may be less helpful in interpreting observed pain and predicting upcoming pain. Future research could focus more on the characteristics of models that could influence the communication of painful states (e.g., fear of pain or pain tolerance).</p><p>In the current study, OBL influenced participants' expectations, which is in line with the theoretical model of placebo effects in pain <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref> and the results of a meta-analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>. Interestingly, expectations in participants who observed high-and low-accuracy models developed differently.</p><p>Participants observing a highly accurate model expected more pain in the post-OBL phase compared to the baseline phase when thermal stimuli were applied without a placebo. OBL did not influence participants' expectations related to stimuli applied with a placebo; thus, their expectations aligned with their pain responses to stimuli administered with and without a placebo. Participants observing the low-accuracy model also expected more pain in the post-OBL phase when thermal stimuli were applied without a placebo. However, their expectations related to stimuli applied with a placebo were lower than their baseline expectations. Since the low-accuracy model was not perceived as a reliable source of information regarding impending pain, observers might have attended not so much to the model's hyperalgesic responses but to the whole context accompanying all the observed pain-related behaviors, thus developing pain-related expectations on this basis. The pattern of expectations observed in this group could potentially lead to placebo hypoalgesia. Based on this result, we speculate that the features of the model may not only influence the magnitude of placebo effects induced by OBL <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>, but could also be considered a factor that determines the type of effect elicited through OBL.</p><p>Pain-related expectations were not involved in nocebo hyperalgesia induced in participants observing a highly accurate model, which is in line with data showing that cognitive processes may not necessarily mediate nocebo <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> or placebo effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Interestingly, expectations mediated pain responses in participants observing a low-accuracy model.</p><p>This result aligns with data showing that the mediating role of expectations may be particularly evident when available information concerning pain is incongruent <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. It seems that information on pain received from a source perceived as low accuracy could work similarly to incongruent information on pain.</p><p>The current study also investigated the associations between observers' characteristics and placebo effects. Empathy, although linked to social learning of placebo effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, was not associated with participants' ability to internalize the experiences of the observed person. This result aligns with a meta-analysis showing that empathy is relatively weakly related to placebo effects induced by OBL <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>. Prior research identified optimism <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38]</ref>, fear of pain <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, sensitivity to bodily signals <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, and reward responsiveness <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36]</ref> as predictors of placebo effects. The current study did not confirm these associations, which aligns with the results of recently published meta-analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. However, it should be noted that the sample sizes of the studies cited above and those included in the meta-analysis could be insufficient to detect associations between observers' individual differences and their responses to a placebo.</p><p>One limitation of this study is the healthy, young sample; therefore, these findings should be generalized to the clinical population with caution. In this study, as in previous ones, the observer was simultaneously exposed to the hyperalgesic and hypoalgesic responses of the model. This procedure makes it difficult to determine the role of OBL in developing hypoalgesic reactions to placebo in an observer. To eliminate this issue, future studies may consider studying OBL with adapted experimental paradigms. For instance, it would be advisable to administer pain stimuli to the participant, then present a placebo-treated model who responds to these pain stimuli with lesser pain than the participant, after which the participant's responses to the same pain stimuli applied with and without a placebo would be checked. A limitation of this study could also be the design of the control group. Although participants in this group did not observe a model experiencing pain, they watched a video of swimming fish, which may have relaxed them or distracted them from the pain, thus inadvertently affecting their pain responses.</p><p>Some methodological advantages should also be noticed. The efficacy of the manipulation of model's accuracy was controlled for. Data showed that participants from the experimental groups differed in their estimation of the observed model's accuracy, and these differences were in line with the assumed directions. However, the estimated accuracy of the model did not mediate participants' responses to pain. Observing high-and low-accuracy models also influenced participants' predictions regarding their accuracy in differentiating stimuli of different intensities.</p><p>However, participants' actual accuracy in pain reporting during the baseline did not moderate the effects elicited by OBL. To control for the participants' level of involvement in the experiment, a series of questions were asked at the end of the experiment.</p><p>The findings from this study might have practical implication.</p><p>Considering the efficacy of highly accurate models in shaping responses to placebo, it would be advisable to involve well-adjusted patients as models to demonstrate the potentially positive effects of treatment.

Study design. A) The experiment consisted of four phases: calibration, baseline, OBL, and post-OBL. During the baseline, participants received 16 pain stimuli of moderate intensity applied to both forearms. Then, a placebo ointment was applied to one of the forearms. During the OBL, participants observed either a video-recorded model (experimental groups) or a control video (control group). During post-OBL, 16 pain stimuli of moderate intensity were applied. Half of the stimuli were applied to the forearm covered with a placebo ointment. Pain expectations were measured after the baseline, after OBL, and after post-OBL. A single trial consisted of a pain stimulus accompanied by a thermometer icon presented on the screen, NRS for pain intensity rating, and a black screen before the next trial began. Notably, post-OBL trials included an additional ointment icon during thermal stimulus administration to the forearm covered with a placebo ointment and during the following NRS for pain intensity rating. B) In the experimental groups, OBL consisted of two videos: a stimuli discrimination task (accuracy manipulation)</figDesc><graphic coords="5,156.65,71.95,282.05,364.35" type="bitmap" /></figure>
