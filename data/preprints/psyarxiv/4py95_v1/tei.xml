<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Believing Difficulties can Build Character Supports Daily Well-being</head><p>Unbidden difficulties, setbacks, and obstacles can make life feel hard.</p><p>In the current paper, we build on identity-based motivation theory which predicts that people make sense of their experiences of ease and difficulty by drawing on whether the experience has self-relevance <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Oyserman, 2007)</ref>.</p><p>In the case of life difficulties, people can infer that difficulties are the path to character strength and moral integrity "That which does not kill you makes you stronger." Indeed, on average, people living in more traditional societies (China, India, Iran, and Turkey) agree that life difficulties can improve character, while adults in Australia, Canada, the U.K., and the U.S. agree slightly <ref type="bibr">(Yan, Oyserman, Kiper, &amp; Atari, 2023)</ref>. In each society, the more people endorse the idea that difficulty is a key means of character improvement, the more they also report well-being and a preference for using effortful means to attain their goals. We examine the robustness of these between-person associations and the implication of substantial between-person variability in endorsing difficulty-as-improvement. We then turn to within-person variability in difficulty-as-improvement beliefs.</p><p>Identity-based motivation theory predicts but has not yet documented within-person variability in the inferences people draw from ease and difficulty. Because the processes that influence global evaluations and daily states are distinct at a statistical and psychological level <ref type="bibr">(Affleck et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr">Newman et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Nezlek, 2001)</ref>, studies documenting individual differences reveal little about difficulty-as-improvement in daily life. We examine how common it is for students to experience daily difficulty, the extent difficulty-as-improvement varies within persons, and the associations between these fluctuations and daily well-being and effortful action. Before describing our studies and results, we summarize identity-based motivation theory, evidence of construct validity, and evidence of individual-difference effects.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Identity-based motivation theory</head><p>Identity-based motivation (IBM) is a social psychological theory of motivation, goal pursuit, and self-regulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Oyserman, 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Oyserman, , 2009))</ref>. It predicts a recursive relationship between how certain people feel about an aspect of their identity, what they do, and what they infer from their experiences of ease and difficulty while thinking about self-relevant tasks and goals or thinking about their lives as having unbidden difficulties <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Fisher &amp; Oyserman, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Oyserman, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Oyserman &amp; Yan, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">Yan, Oyserman, Kiper, &amp; Atari, 2023)</ref>. IBM theory predicts that people vary in how much they endorse difficulty-as-importance (no-pain-no-gain), difficultyas-impossibility (path of least resistance), and difficulty-as-improvement (what does not kill us makes us stronger) and that situations affect which one of these mindsets is accessible at the moment of judgment. IBM links theories about thinking, motivation, and the self by focusing on people's inferences from their metacognitive experiences -the recursive relationship between identities and what people infer when thinking feels easy or difficult. IBM theory assumes situation-based and person-based variability in both.</p><p>IBM theory articulates three inferences from metacognitive experiences of difficulty. When it feels hard to think about potentially selfrelevant tasks or goals, that metacognitive experience can imply value and importance to an aspect of one's identity (difficulty-as-importance) but also a lack of identity-relevance, making engagement a waste of time (difficultyas-impossibility). Parallelly, when it feels hard to endure life's unbidden hardships, that metacognitive experience can imply that enduring properly can yield a stronger spirit, soul, and character. People are sensitive to the inference they draw but not necessarily to its source, such that small cues, such as describing how often they make one or the other inference on a high-or low-frequency scale, shift their subsequent self-beliefs and actions <ref type="bibr">(Smith &amp; Oyserman, 2015)</ref>. There is some evidence that people who endorse difficulty-as-improvement more also report more experiences of difficulty-as-improvement <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Haque &amp; Oyserman, 2024)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Relationship with Action and Self-judgments</head><p>People tend to find effort aversive and costly <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Inzlicht et al., 2018)</ref> and loathe using effortful means <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(de Bruin et al., 2023)</ref>. They commonly interpret having to exert effort as the opposite of having ability <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(O'Donnell et al., 2023)</ref> and motivation <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Feldon et al., 2019)</ref>. Even though engaging effortfully can yield better learning (more long-term recall after enduring "desirable difficulties," <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Bjork, 1994)</ref>, they may not believe they have learned something if learning felt effortful and difficult <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Baars et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>In contrast, adopting a difficulty-as-improvement mindset is associated with seeing effortful means as effective --people who endorse difficulty-as-improvement seem to carry over the belief that life hardships can have character benefits to a preference for effortful means of attaining their possible identities. Thus, in three studies, <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Kiper, Oyserman, and Yan (2024)</ref> asked students to rate each of six distinct means to attain possible identities related to school, fitness, and health. Students who scored higher in difficulty-as-improvement (controlling for their difficulty-as-importance, and difficulty-as-impossibility scores) rated more effortful means as more effective and less effortful means as less effective. They said they would be more likely to use the former and less likely to use the latter. This pattern was not replicated for the other inferences from difficulty. Controlling for, difficulty-as-improvement and difficulty-as-importance scores, students who scored higher in difficulty-as-impossibility preferred less effortful means of attaining these possible identities. Controlling for difficulty-as-improvement and difficulty-as-impossibility scores, students who scored higher in difficulty-as-importance were agnostic as to means of goal attainment.</p><p>Whether or not the effortful way is better, the Leary and Baumeister sociometer theory of self-esteem predicts that using effortful means of goal attainment may benefit self-esteem and social regard if others approve <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Leary &amp; Baumeister 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Baumeister et al., 2003)</ref>. We infer that this is the case. For example, people perceive hard workers to be honest and diligent <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Amos et al., 2019)</ref> and people who expend more effort as competent and cooperative <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Celniker et al., 2023)</ref>. They perceive selfcontrol as a sign of moral fiber <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Mooijman et al., 2018)</ref>. Moreover, experiencing high self-esteem is associated with other aspects of well-being including life satisfaction, and finding life to have meaning and coherence.</p><p>For example, self-satisfaction (self-esteem) and life satisfaction tend to cooccur people who feel satisfied with themselves also tend to feel that way about their lives (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Kwan et al., 1997)</ref>. The reverse pattern also holds.</p><p>That is, people who do not find their lives meaningful are unlikely to find themselves worthy (self-esteem) <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Chamberlain &amp; Zika, 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Steger et al., 2006)</ref>. Drawing on this literature, we predict that people who endorse difficulty-as-improvement experience a more positive sense of self-worth or self-esteem, evaluate their lives positively (e.g., more life satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Pavot &amp; Diener, 1993)</ref>, and find their lives to make sense (meaning in life, <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Steger et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr">and coherence, Martela &amp; Steger, 2016)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measuring Difficulty-as-improvement a Distinct Motivational</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Construct</head><p>Trait difficulty-as-improvement can be measured reliably and the scale shows measurement invariance, as detailed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Yan, Oyserman, Kiper, and Atari (2023)</ref> in ten studies using adult respondents in eight countries, four Western and four non-Western <ref type="bibr">(N= 2,380)</ref>. They report support for configural (construct structure), metric (item factor loadings), and scalar (item intercepts) measurement invariance for difficulty-as-improvement and support for configural and metric invariance for difficulty-as-importance and difficulty-as-impossibility. That is, items load onto the expected single factor and can be assumed to load the same way across samples from countries that vary in traditionality and Westernization.</p><p>Regarding discriminant validity, trait difficulty-as-importance, trait difficulty-as-impossibility, and trait difficulty-as-improvement scores are distinct when simultaneously assessed. Using <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Kline's (2011)</ref> rule-of-thumb for discriminant validity (rs &gt; 0.85), trait difficulty-as-improvement scores are distinct from trait difficulty-as-impossibility and trait difficulty-asimportance scores. The association between difficulty-as-impossibility and difficulty-as-improvement has a 95% confidence interval ranging from r =-.04 to -.39 <ref type="bibr">(Yan et al., 2023, ten studies)</ref> and r=-.04 to -.26 <ref type="bibr">(Kiper et al., 2024, across three studies)</ref>. The association between difficulty-asimportance and difficulty-as-improvement has a 95% confidence interval ranging from r = 0.23 to 0.68 <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">(Yan et al., 2023</ref>, ten studies) and r=0.62 to 0.74 <ref type="bibr">Kiper et al., 2024, three studies)</ref>. Moreover, controlling for trait difficulty-as-importance and trait difficulty-as-impossibility, trait difficultyas-improvement is associated with seeing silver linings for oneself and one's community during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Kiper et al., 2022)</ref>. These analyses use a structural equation model with latent constructs, including as controls the time of data collection, political conservatism, and as predictors difficulty-as-improvement, difficulty-asimportance, and difficulty-as-impossibility.</p><p>Researchers also document discriminant validity by examining incremental effects of difficulty-as-improvement controlling for difficulty-asimportance and difficulty-as-impossibility scores. This reveals that the more people endorse difficulty-as-improvement, the more they see themselves as virtuous, optimistic, and conscientious people leading meaningful lives (small-to-moderate sized effect, ten studies, across eight countries, <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Yan, Oyserman, et al., 2023)</ref>. As a check of discriminant validity, the researchers added a measure of growth mindset to the model, finding that results are robust to adding this control. Logically, people who believe that with effort, they cannot change their intelligence or abilities (fixed mindset) should be more likely to try to ferret out and avoid situations in which they or others could discover that their intelligence or abilities are low <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(O'Donnell et al., 2023)</ref>. Conversely, people who believe the opposite, that with effort their intelligence or abilities can change, may be less likely to endorse the idea of difficulty-as-impossibility --that difficulty signals that a task or goal is a waste of one's time <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Oyserman &amp; Destin, 2010)</ref>. Empirically, <ref type="bibr">Yan and colleagues (2023)</ref> found small correlations between endorsing a fixed mindset and difficulty-as-improvement and no significant correlation with endorsing a growth mindset (fixed and growth mindset items do not load onto the same factor in their Chinese sample, see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">O'Donnell et al., 2023)</ref>. Controlling for associations with fixed mindset scores, difficulty-asimprovement scores explained a statistically significant additional variance in virtuousness and meaning in life <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">(Yan et al., 2023)</ref>. We infer from these results that differences in difficulty-as-improvement scores are uniquely associated with these self-judgments, distinct from the contributions of difficulty-as-importance and difficulty-as-impossibility and growth-mindset scores.</p><p>Though believing that suffering can build character or purify the soul is congruent with religious and conservative world views, trait difficulty-asimprovement scores are distinct from religiosity, conservatism, belief in fate, belief in karma, and Protestant Ethic scale scores. Thus, <ref type="bibr">Yan and colleagues (2023)</ref> document small-to-moderate-sized correlations with religiosity, conservatism, belief in fate, and belief in karma across ten studies while <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Haque and Oyserman (2024)</ref> document a small-sized positive association with Protestant Work Ethic scores in two studies. In these studies, Protestant Work Ethic scores but not trait-difficulty-as-improvement scores correlated with moralizing self-control successes and failures <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Haque &amp; Oyserman, 2024)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Current Studies Pilot Test of Discriminant Validity</head><p>We started with two pilot convergent and discriminant validity studies to bolster prior evidence that trait difficulty-as-improvement is a distinct construct. The data are located in OSF and you can access them by cutting and pasting this link into your browser: https://osf.io/qs8dn/? view_only=b4c785b8ceb74adfa5f6d15473cfd040.</p><p>Adults on Mturk (total N = 730, 50% female) participated in November 2017 (n=345) and January 2018 (n=385). About half (51.6%) of participants identified as Democrats (27.8% as Republicans, 20.5% chose the something else response). They were on the liberal side of the scale mid-point (M= 3.44, 1=very liberal to 7=very conservative). About half (46.4%) identified as Christian (most of the others identified as agnostic, 21%, or atheist, 21) and on the less religious side (M = 2.54 on a scale from 1=not at all religious to 6=very religious).</p><p>We obtained responses to six predictors and two predicted variables.</p><p>Predictors were difficulty-as-improvement, the <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Fisher and Oyserman (2017)</ref> 4-item difficulty-as-importance, difficulty-as-impossibility, ease-aspossibility, and ease-as-triviality scales, <ref type="bibr">Cacioppo et al.'s (1984)</ref> 18-item need for cognition scale, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Dweck's (2000)</ref> 8-item growth/ fixed mindset scale. Our predicted variables were the 9-item <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">John and Srivastava (1999)</ref> conscientiousness and the 8-item <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Duckworth and Quinn (2009)</ref> grit scale.</p><p>Though highly correlated, conscientiousness and grit are potentially distinct constructs describing a trait of following through on commitments <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Hagen &amp; Solem, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Ponnock et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Schmidt et al., 2018)</ref>. As detailed in Supplemental Materials (Pilot Studies 1-2), our November and January data collection episodes differed somewhat in item wording, response scales, and scale order of presentation.</p><p>We first ran linear regressions. Then, following <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Westfall and Yarkoni (2016)</ref> we used structural equation modeling to evidence the incremental validity of difficulty-as-improvement. We detail methods and results in Supplemental Materials (Pilot Studies 1-2).</p><p>Linear regressions controlling for the six other predictors and the data collection episode revealed a significant association between difficultyas-improvement scores, and conscientiousness and grit scores. Controlling for the six other predictors and the data collection episode and applying a Bonferroni correction, difficulty-as-improvement uniquely contributed to the prediction of conscientiousness in our SEM. In a second SEM using the same analytic plan with grit as the predicted variable, difficulty-asimprovement was a unique predictor of grit before the Bonferroni correction, but not after applying it. We conclude that difficulty-asimprovement is distinct from growth/ fixed mindset, need for cognition, difficulty-as-importance, difficulty-as-impossibility, ease-as-possibility, and ease-as-triviality.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Overview of Diary Studies</head><p>In conducting our daily diary studies, we followed the recommendation of <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Nezlek (2012)</ref> and used scales validated at the trait level by adapting their items for daily administration. Our predictions proceed in two steps. We make three predictions (H1 to H3) that replicate and extend prior between-person research: H1: People respond analogously to the difficulty-as-improvement trait level scale when the scale items use secular (improve) or religious (purify) wording (scores on the two scales highly correlate). We tested H1 in Study 4.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H2:</head><p>Variability in difficulty-as-improvement is more at the between-person level (but meaningful within-person variability occurs). We tested H2 in Studies 1 to 4. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H3:</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H5:</head><p>Daily difficulty-as-improvement is associated with daily well-being even controlling for daily positive and negative events. On days people endorse difficulty-as-improvement more compared to their two-week average, they are more likely to report experiencing (a) meaning in life, (b) coherence, (c) self-esteem, and (d) life satisfaction, (e) engage in effortful strategies and (f) experience successes. We tested H5 in Studies 1 to 4.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method Open Science Framework</head><p>Study 1 provided evidence of the feasibility of our diary approach in our population. We pre-registered Studies 2-4 and placed the preregistrations, the full set of items in each measure, all data, and our R script into this OSF link (cut and paste into your browser) https://osf.io/qs8dn/? view_only=b4c785b8ceb74adfa5f6d15473cfd040.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample</head><p>Each 14-day diary study took place in a different semester and with different subject pool participants who received subject pool course credit (final N =382; race-ethnicity was diverse, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">S1 Supplemental</ref>  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Power and Stop Rules</head><p>We pre-registered Studies 2 to 4 with the plan of collecting as large a sample as possible given our participant pool constraints. Given the attained sample size, at the between-person level, we were underpowered in each study <ref type="bibr">(.39, .55, .26, and .33, respectively)</ref> but adequately powered at the aggregate level (.92) to detect trait-level correlations of r = .17 (the smallest effect we detected). A sensitivity analysis indicated we were adequately powered <ref type="bibr">(.80)</ref> to detect between-person correlations as small as r = .14, and powered at .92 to detect the smallest significant betweenperson correlations of r = .17. To maximize statistical power for betweenperson analyses, we aggregated the datasets and ran analyses on this combined dataset and presented both these and by-study results in figureform (details in Supplemental Materials).</p><p>Our within-person analyses are powered at the study level <ref type="bibr">(.99, 1.00, .94, and .97 respectively)</ref>. For clarity, we used the same presentation format to present by-study and aggregate results. In doing so, we follow Fabrigar and Wegener ( <ref type="formula">2016</ref>), who note that aggregated effects across studies are more reliable than any individual study. For within-person analyses, the size of the aggregated dataset was well above the recommendations by Nezlek (2012) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Maas &amp; Hox (2005)</ref> for daily diary studies. Our aggregated sample was adequately powered at .80 to detect medium-sized (r = .30) between-person correlations (per a G*Power analysis). Within-person power analyses indicated we achieved 1.00 power to detect relationships between daily difficulty-as-improvement and daily successes, which was the smallest effect we detected (details, Supplemental Materials).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure</head><p>Students watched an instructional video before starting and received an email each evening for fourteen days at 9:00 pm with a link to the daily survey to be completed as close as possible to bedtime. Students completed the trait measures in two randomized chunks in Studies 1 to 3 (one half before and the other half after the diary portion of the study) and in a single chunk in Study 4 (before the diary study). Our initial rationale for dividing the survey into two chunks was that we wanted students to complete it without experiencing fatigue. Our rationale for varying order was to reduce spurious correlations. We did not expect order would matter and it did not (see Supplemental Materials, Exploratory Analyses).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures</head><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> presents by-study descriptive information for scales and event checklists.

Table <ref type="table">2</ref> presents the items for the trait and daily secular (Study 4) and religious (Studies 1 to 4) difficulty-as-improvement scales. The daily scale focuses on difficulties that occurred that day. Participants could report not experiencing any difficulties. On 88.164% of daily entries, they reported experiencing difficulties, if they reported experiencing no difficulties, we treated that day as missing in difficulty-as-improvement analyses.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis Plan</head><p>We used package psych <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Revelle, 2024)</ref> for descriptive statistics and package lme4 (v. 1.1-23; <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bates et al., 2015)</ref> for multilevel models in the R (v. 4.1.2) programming language (R Core Team, 2021). We computed daymeasure reliability per Nezlek (2012) by creating three-level models, nesting the items of each scale within days and days within persons. The estimate of true variance over total variance comes from the null model intercept. We used two-level multilevel models (nesting days within persons) to test our predictions. Per Nezlek (2012), we included random intercepts and random slopes in each model and trimmed the error term if the model failed to converge because there was not enough variation in the random effects. Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Rights and Sterba (2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">2021)</ref> we calculated effect sizes using the r2mlm function <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Shaw et al., 2023)</ref>, which provides a measure that is akin to a correlation when the square root is computed (the square root of the proportion of variance reduction, <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Hox, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Kreft &amp; de Leeuw, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Raudenbush &amp; Bryk, 2002)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Religion and Religious Practice</head><p>We conducted pre-registered exploratory analyses on the relationship between difficulty-as-improvement beliefs, religiosity, and daily religious experiences (Supplemental Materials Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">S11</ref>). Given that difficulty-as-improvement themes as present in various religions, we asked if trait difficulty-as-improvement was associated with the likelihood of engaging in religious activities on any given day. We found no significant relationship <ref type="bibr">(meta-analytic b=0.05, t=1.26, p=.210)</ref>. However, religious people were modestly more likely to endorse difficulty-as-improvement (both assessed as traits, meta-analytic r=.17, t=3.35, p &lt; .001). And, on days people participated in religious activities, they endorsed difficulty-as-improvement more (meta-analytic b=0.08, t=2.37, p=.019). We infer that religious activities and beliefs may modestly boost difficulty-as-improvement beliefs rather than the reverse.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Daily Failures and Using Less Effortful Means of Goal Attainment (Supplemental Materials S12 to S23)</head><p>We conducted pre-registered exploratory analyses on the relationship between difficulty-as-improvement beliefs and daily engagement with less effortful strategies (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">S12</ref>), and daily failures (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">S13</ref>). We found two distinct patterns. On the one hand, trait-level difficulty-as-improvement was not significantly associated with using less effortful strategies (b=0.05, t=1.54, p=.124) or experiencing failures (b=-0.03, t=-1.21, p=.228) on any given day. On the other hand, on days people reported higher than their average endorsement of difficulty-as-improvement, they were more likely to report using less effortful strategies (b=0.08, t=4.94, p &lt; .001) and less likely to report failures (b=-0.07, t=-4.39, p &lt; .001). We infer that daily fluctuations in difficulty-as-improvement beliefs capture nuances in lived experience that trait associations cannot.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Temporal Patterns</head><p>Our pre-registered exploratory analyses of temporal patterns revealed that people higher in trait difficulty-as-improvement were also more likely to report daily difficulty-as-improvement (see Table <ref type="table">S24</ref>). Two-week aggregated daily difficulty-as-improvement scores are associated with greater daily well-being (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">S25</ref>). Across the two-week study period, daily endorsement of difficulty-as-improvement slightly decreased (Table <ref type="table">S26</ref>), and the association between difficulty-as-improvement and coherence became stronger; see Supplemental Materials for details. These patterns highlight a limitation of a diary method -with sufficient repetition, the nature of relationships may change by having participants repeatedly reflect.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Leveraging Daily Fluctuations to Examine Incremental Validity</head><p>A final set of exploratory analyses in Supplemental Materials concerns the 'no difficulty today' response option. When treated as a dichotomous</p><p>predictor (1 = difficulty experienced, 0 = no difficulty experienced), we found that people report greater well-being on days when no difficulty occurred. On days they did report experiencing difficulty, as evidenced by H5 results, we found a positive association between well-being and difficulty-as-improvement scores, suggesting that the positive relationships between difficulty-as-improvement and well-being were not merely due to shared instances of positively valenced constructs. We provide details of these models in Supplemental Materials.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Discussion</head><p>People vary in how much they believe that enduring life difficulties can support their spirit and character, whether measured with secular (character) or religious (spiritual growth) wording. Variance in daily difficulty-as-improvement scores is more attributable to between-person than within-person fluctuations. People's trait-level difficulty-asimprovement score is associated with their trait and daily well-being, their daily use of effortful strategies, and their daily successes. But people also vary meaningfully across days in their endorsement of difficulty-asimprovement. Regardless of their general tendency, on days when people endorse difficulty-as-improvement more than their two-week average, they report more meaning in life, coherence, self-esteem, and life satisfaction, engage in effortful strategies, and experience success more. Each of these associations is moderate in size. Finally, in aggregate analyses, yesterday's higher difficulty-as-improvement predicted today's higher meaning in life and self-esteem. Lagged effects do not attain p &lt; .05 significance in any individual study, implying that more research is needed to understand lagged impacts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theoretical Implications</head><p>Our results have implications for identity and well-being theorizing.</p><p>Regarding identity, we advance theorizing on how identity-based motivation works by using a diary method. We document that difficulty-as-improvement meaningfully fluctuates and that these fluctuations matter. In doing so we build on two sets of studies: studies documenting small-to-moderate associations between difficulty-as-improvement beliefs and preference for using effortful means to attain academic, physical fitness and weight possible selves <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Kiper et al., 2024)</ref> and small-to-moderate associations between difficulty-as-improvement beliefs and well-being in adult samples in Australia, Canada, China, India, Iran, Turkey, the U.K., and the U.S., <ref type="bibr">(Yan et al., 2023)</ref>. Regarding effortful means, our results add to the prior finding that students who score higher in difficulty-as-improvement prefer effortful means of pursuing possible selves and disdain less effortful ones <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Kiper et al., 2024)</ref>. We document that even controlling for the day's general positivity or negativity, when daily difficulty-as-improvement is higher, people are more likely to use effortful strategies to pursue their daily goals.</p><p>We infer that difficulty-as-improvement beliefs may carry over to effortful engagement with daily tasks and goals.</p><p>Regarding well-being research, our studies suggest that associations with well-being are robust to using secular or religious wording in the difficulty-as-improvement measure and generalize to a broad conceptualization of well-being as meaning in life, life satisfaction, life coherence, and self-esteem. Prior research links positive mental health with experiencing meaning in life and coherence <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(SchÃ¤fer et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Winger et al., 2016)</ref> and with higher self-esteem and life satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Lewinsohn et al., 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Park, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Sowislo &amp; Orth, 2013)</ref>. Moving beyond static associations, we show that difficulty-as-improvement beliefs are associated with everyday well-being and self-regard. We find meaningful within-person and between-person variability in difficulty-as-improvement and document that on days that people are higher than their average difficulty-asimprovement beliefs, they are also higher than their average in meaning in life, life satisfaction, life coherence, and self-esteem. We found preliminary evidence that the temporal course is more from difficulty-as-improvement beliefs to well-being than the reverse. In exploratory analyses, we found an association between engaging in religious activities and believing in difficulty-as-improvement on any given day. In doing so, we add to the literature describing antecedents of meaning and coherence in life, life satisfaction, and self-esteem and to the literature on how religiosity relates to physical and mental health (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Hoogeveen et al., 2023)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations and Future Directions</head><p>Each set of studies has limitations; here we focus on limitations due to design, measurement, and sample. A strength of our design is that diary studies provide an ecologically valid approach to understanding how difficulty-as-improvement beliefs matter in everyday life. We show that daily fluctuations occur and are associated with fluctuations in well-being and action. However, the daily diary design cannot address whether the process is causal. To test causal processes, future researchers could make a difficulty-as-improvement mindset accessible using either an autobiographical recall task or a biased scale approach and test consequences for well-being or action. While our diary design is ecologically valid, an experimental approach addresses causality once difficulty-asimprovement is made accessible or triggered.</p><p>Regarding measures, we used previously developed difficulty-asimprovement and well-being (meaning in life, coherence, self-esteem, and life satisfaction) measures. Measures behaved in our studies as in other studies using different populations, increasing our confidence in our findings. We were powered to test between-person effects at the aggregate, not the study level so we cannot address questions of study-level variability, which may be due to power, measurement error, or the inherent variability of results. Regarding within-person fluctuations, we have the same limitations of being powered in the aggregate. Here too, we cannot address whether study-level variability is due to power, measurement error, or the inherent variability of situated results. We used extant daily measures and created the daily difficulty-as-improvement measure. We know that on days that people engaged in religious activities, they were also more likely to endorse difficulty-as-improvement. However, this does not preclude that other daily situations might evoke higher or lower than average person-level difficulty-as-improvement. Future studies could use ecological momentary assessment to obtain information about other situations that could trigger variability of difficulty-as-improvement beliefs. We also know that religious people were more likely to endorse difficulty-as-improvement on any given day. Future studies could measure other social identities to obtain a broader sense of the association between social or collective identities and endorsing difficulty-as-improvement.</p><p>A final limitation of daily use measures is that the common psychometric tests for construct validity at the trait level are difficult and sometimes impossible to run in daily diary methods. In our case, while incremental validity of the trait measure has been documented, it is particularly difficult to provide incremental validity over alternative constructs of the daily measure. A reader might wonder about the incremental validity of daily difficulty-as-improvement beliefs over other daily beliefs like a growth mindset. The strength of a daily method is that it highlights specific experiences. The problem in testing questions of incremental validity of daily constructs is that the relevant daily-level questions refer to different experiences. For instance, a daily growth mindset item could be "Your intelligence is something about you that you couldn't really change very much today." In contrast, daily difficulty-asimprovement items refer specifically to inferences from difficult situations such as "The difficulties I experienced today might bend or break me temporarily, but they can purify me in the long run" and participants had the option of saying that nothing difficult had occurred that day. While individual difference measures lend themselves to incremental validity tests, daily constructs that differ in reference points do not lend themselves to these tests.</p><p>Turning to sample-based limitations, our sample was diverse --roughly a third described themselves as Asian or Asian American, another third as White or Euro-American, and the final third divided among people describing themselves as Hispanic/Latino, African American/Black, or other backgrounds. We were not powered to test differences by race-ethnicity, national heritage, religiosity, or other indicators including family socioeconomic status and age. For two reasons, each might be a fruitful avenue for future research. First, <ref type="bibr">Yan and colleagues (2023)</ref> documented that difficulty-as-improvement is higher among people from more traditional cultures and cultures experiencing more harsh environments in crossnational surveys and is higher among more religious people. The implication is that people from different socio-economic and cultural heritage backgrounds in the U.S. might each arrive at difficulty-as-improvement beliefs through different socialization patterns. Second, while not yet studied, people gain a sense that suffering must be endured as they look back on their lives or as they look forward to their possible future lives and imagine difficulties to be endured. Preliminary evidence suggests that harsh environments are associated with higher difficulty-as-improvement scores <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Malekabadi &amp; Oyserman, 2023)</ref>. Future qualitative research could help reveal the experience of endorsing difficulty-as-improvement under harsh life situations.</p></div>

People who endorse difficulty-DAILY DIFFICULTY-AS-IMPROVEMENT AND WELL-BEING 49 as-improvement experience themselves and their lives more positively, engage in effortful strategies, and experience success more. Since these factors are associated with health, the implication is that believing that hardships can build character and hence are good for something may be protective of mental and physical health.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>H4:</head><label></label><figDesc>People who score higher in trait difficulty-as-improvement also report more trait-level well-being.

We H3 tested in Studies 1 to 4. Second, we make three predictions (H4 to H6) regarding daily fluctuations. People who endorse trait difficulty-as-improvement experience average greater daily well-being (a) meaning in life, (b) coherence, (c) feelings of self-esteem, and (d) life satisfaction. They engage in daily (e) effortful strategies. They experience more daily (f) successes in possible identity-relevant domains. We tested H4 in Studies 1 to 4.</figDesc></figure>
