<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Humans uniquely exhibit preferences for artworks, even those that initially evoke negative emotions such as horror or disgust. This raises an intriguing question: How do people come to like artworks that initially provoke negative feelings? This paradox has garnered considerable scholarly attention beyond philosophy <ref type="bibr">(Gaut, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Korsmeyer, 2012)</ref>. In psychology, subjective fluency -defined as the ease and speed of cognitive processing of a given stimulus -is recognized as a fundamental contributor to human preferences <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Forster et al., 2013)</ref>. Research has shown a strong link between subjective fluency and preference for neutral or positive stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Forster et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Forster et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Graf et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Reber et al., 2004)</ref>. However, their relationship for negative valence stimuli has yielded mixed findings.</p><p>For example, some studies have found that increased fluency of displeasing objects (e.g., images of guns) lead to heightened preference <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Halberstadt, 2006)</ref>, while others report a decrease in preference <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Albrecht &amp; Carbon, 2014)</ref>. These mixed findings suggest that subjective fluency plays a complex role in shaping preference. Specifically, two models have emerged: the hedonic fluency model (HFM) says fluency increases preference no matter the object's valence <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Winkielman &amp; Cacioppo, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Winkielman et al., 2003)</ref>, while the fluency amplification model (FAM) says fluency amplifies valence impact on preference <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Albrecht &amp; Carbon, 2014)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Landwehr and Eckmann (2020)</ref> showed that both models might work together: increased fluency can boost preference (HFM) but also intensify negative feelings, reducing preference (FAM).</p><p>However, the prediction of FAM contradicts some findings in empirical aesthetics, particularly for the context of art appreciation. Theoretical models of art appreciation suggest that cognitive resources, a primary source of subjective fluency, mitigate the influence of valence on artwork appraisal. For instance, the distancing-embracing model identifies an 'art schema' as a critical distancing factor, preventing beholders from being overwhelmed by negative feelings to assess displeasing artworks <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Menninghaus et al., 2017)</ref>. Similarly, the model of aesthetic appreciation and judgement includes the buffering effects of art expertise and contextual information on gut feelings <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Leder et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr">Leder &amp; Nadal, 2014)</ref>. Empirical evidence also supports that various cognitive factors weaken the valence-driven evaluation of visual artworks <ref type="bibr">(Leder et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Silvia, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Steciuch et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Van Paasschen et al., 2015)</ref>. Given that fluency amplification effects have been mainly observed in daily objects processing such as words or images, these findings imply that its moderating power on valence effect may show different patterns between daily object and art processing (i.e., amplification versus mitigation). Since these expectations were not explicitly examined in terms of subjective fluency, it needs to be examined. We hypothesized that subjective fluency not only enhances preferences for displeasing artworks as predicted by HFM but also dilutes the valence effect, challenging FAM.</p><p>Then, how does subjective fluency weaken the valence effect on preferences during art appreciation? The pleasure-interest model (PIA model) offers a theoretical framework for this investigation <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Graf &amp; Landwehr, 2015)</ref>. The PIA model says people feel negative about a stimulus when fluency is lower than expected. But 'controlled processing' can reduce this disfluency, increasing liking despite initial negative feelings. This means that increases in subjective fluency through controlled processing enables preference even for initially displeasing artworks by leading beholders to focus on semantically relevant parts of stimuli rather than gut feelings per se. As controlled processing is a key player in this cognitive process, previous studies based on the PIA model motivated participants to execute controlled processing by asking them to come up with the title of the stimuli in the appreciation task <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Graf &amp; Landwehr, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Steciuch et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Vissers &amp; Wagemans, 2023)</ref>. Despite its straightforwardness and utility, previous experimental protocol is limited in assessing participants' fidelity of controlled processing because the titles they suggested were not explicitly evaluated. Also, this behavioral response could not fully capture one's dynamic processing progresses.</p><p>To address these limitations, we employed eye-tracking as an objective measure of processing style since gaze-related metrics (e.g., total fixation duration) offer insights into the spatiotemporal profile of individual-or group-level visual attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Borys &amp; Plechawska-Wójcik, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Harezlak et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Krauzlis, 2005)</ref>. Researchers applied the eye-tracking approach to examine different top-down/bottom-up strategies between children and adults in the art appreciation <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Walker et al., 2017)</ref>. Inspired by this approach, we recorded participants' eye movement while they appreciated artworks to investigate their processing styles. While only images were provided to the control group, descriptive texts were also presented along with images to the experimental group to motivate this group to conduct controlled processing in the main appreciation task. Every text highlighted a perceptually unremarkable area as a semantically core region in the appreciation of the artwork (area of interest, 'AOI'). Considering that while selective attention to the perceptually salient region is performed without any involuntary processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Egeth &amp; Yantis, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Itti &amp; Koch, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Shelton &amp; Scullin, 2017)</ref>, attention to the peripheral areas here requires biases such as contextual information <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Baluch &amp; Itti, 2011)</ref>, we operationally defined fixation to AOIs as controlled processing. We predicted that the experimental group would pay attention to these AOIs, while the control group would display dispersed gazing patterns.</p><p>In this study, we examined the cognitive chains from the motivation for controlled processing based on contextual information (experimental manipulation), processing style (reflected in gazing behavior), subjective fluency to preference (measured by self-report ratings). Regarding each step, we formulated research questions and hypotheses as follows: H4. Yes. The interaction effect between fluency and valence on preference ratings is negative.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>A total of 41 young Korean adults participated in the study (30 females; Mage = 22.707 yr; SDage = 2.716 yr). Individuals who majored in art-related fields (i.e., art history, aesthetics, or fine arts) were excluded during recruitment process. To control for baseline emotional states that might influence preference appraisal <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Lerner et al., 2015)</ref>, all participants completed the Korean version of the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule ('K-PANAS') validated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Lim et al. (2010)</ref>. One participant was excluded due to exceptionally high positive affect scores (i.e., exceeding the 1.5 × interquartile range). The remaining participants exhibited moderate mood states (positive: M = 17.875, SD = 4.879; negative: M = 12.950, SD = 7.082). Participants were randomly assigned to the experimental or control group, ensuring equal sample sizes. A Welch two-sample t-test did not find significant differences in positive and negative affect between groups (positive: t(37.851) = .807, p = .425; negative: t(37.974) = 1.213, p = .233). Additionally, the Vienna Art Interest and Art Knowledge Questionnaire ('VAIAK'), developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Specker et al. (2020)</ref>, was administered to manage potential effects of individual differences in art interest and knowledge on the appreciation of art <ref type="bibr">(Leder et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Silvia, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Szubielska et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Van Paasschen et al., 2015)</ref>. Participants' knowledge and interest levels were comparable to those of Western laypeople reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Specker et al. (2020)</ref> (knowledge: M = 9.050, SD = 4.679; interest: M = 45.125, SD = 12.971). Welch two sample t-test did not find any significant differences detected in both art interests and knowledge scores between groups (interest: t(37.120) = -.205, p = .839; knowledge: t(37.889) = -.945, p = .351).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Materials</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Artwork stimuli</head><p>A preliminary survey was conducted to measure the affective valence of artwork stimuli and select significantly affective ones. Seventy Korean respondents (40 females; Mage = 22.957; SDage = 3.454) participated via an online survey. They rated the valence of 100 artworks on a 7point Likert scale (i.e., 1: "Very negative", 7: "Very positive"). Artworks with a median valence score of two or less were classified as 'negative', and those with four or more were classified as 'positive'. This labeling criteria was based on previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Kliem et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr">Leder et al., 2014)</ref>. Thirty-four artworks were classified as 'negative' and 42 as 'positive'. To select the final stimuli, we excluded artworks that were too clear, unclear, or familiar to control for confounding effects of visual contrast <ref type="bibr">(Mayer &amp; Landwehr, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Reber et al., 1998)</ref> and familiarity <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Alter &amp; Oppenheimer, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Manahova et al., 2020)</ref> on processing fluency. Fifteen artworks with rootmean-squared ('RMS') contrast values outside 1.5 × interquartile range were excluded using the 'cv2' package in Python. Twenty six artworks that might be familiar to participants were also excluded (i.e., displayed at the National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art, Korea or Seoul National University Museum of Art from April 2022 to April 2023). From the remaining 35 artworks, we selected four negative and four positive stimuli, avoiding redundancy in artists and themes. Detailed information on these eight artworks is available in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Descriptive texts</head><p>To manipulate motivation for controlled processing of artworks, we included a descriptive text session before the main appreciation task. Given that motivation for controlled processing requires both stimulus-and perceiver-intrinsic triggers <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Graf &amp; Landwehr, 2017)</ref>, we provided the experimental group with printed images and texts together. Negative stimuli images aimed to signal participants to pay more attention to resolve initial negative feelings (stimulus-intrinsic triggers) as reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Carver, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Graf &amp; Landwehr, 2017)</ref>, while texts were intended to facilitate a more sophisticated approach to problem-solving by presenting contextual information (perceiver-intrinsic triggers). This approach was inspired by literature (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Swami, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Szubielska &amp; Sztorc, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Walker et al., 2017)</ref>. Each text, written in Korean by the first and second authors, was limited to 300 words to ensure efficiency in information delivery <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Yi, 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Each text consisted of four paragraphs: (1) Background (e.g., "This painting presents a scene from the Book of Judith of the Old Testament, which portrays Judith and Abra, her maid, who are beheading Holofernes, an Assyrian commander."), (2) Overall Description (e.g., "While Judith is cutting his throat, Abra holds Holofernes with all her might, who resists by kicking off his arms and legs. The firm expression of Judith shows that she is indeed determined."), (3) AOI (e.g., "Abra, with her lips resolute and forehead wrinkled just like Judith, Abra is carrying out her part with utmost strength. She is not just the obeying maid anymore. She knows what she is doing, and the importance of her work sets her willingness."), and (4) Message (e.g., "The lack of hesitation Judith and Abra are displaying can be interpreted as the rage that the painter must have felt at the unacceptable verdict she has received from the society, and as her hope to find someone whom she can share her pain and compassion together."). While (1) Background and</p><p>(2) Overall Description present art history knowledge for the given stimuli, (3) AOI aimed to draw participants' attention to specific area by emphasizing that the region plays an essential role in appreciation. To rule out potential confounding effects of each artwork's perceptual saliency on the eye-tracking analysis, we chose perceptually peripheral areas as AOIs of each stimulus. We plotted a saliency map of all eight stimuli using the Salience Toolbox <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Walther &amp; Koch, 2006)</ref>.</p><p>Through this, we mapped visually salient areas in terms of low-level perceptual features including contrast and orientation. We excluded all pixels mapped as salient regions to define AOIs. Among inconspicuous regions in the image, we defined AOIs considering specific details highlighted in other art historical texts to ensure the motivational effect of descriptive texts based on its plausibility <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Swami, 2013)</ref>  <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measurements</head><p>After viewing each artwork in the main appreciation task, participants answered three questions: (1) subjective fluency ("How easily did you comprehend the topic and meaning of the given artwork?"), ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>) preference ("How much did you like this artwork?"), and (3) initial valence ("Which type of emotions did you feel toward this artwork when you first saw it?"). Each question was rated on a 7-point Likert scale. A single item measure was used to assess subjective fluency, which is sufficient for predictive validity <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Graf et al., 2018)</ref>, to minimize respondent fatigue.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedures</head><p>Participants first completed the descriptive text session. The experimental group read printed materials for 16 artworks (8 used in the appreciation task and 8 randomly selected to prevent them from predicting which artwork will be suggested in the appreciation task) for 10 minutes. The control group viewed printed images only for 2 minutes, ensuring the only difference between groups was the presence of text (see Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">1b</ref>). Participants then sat 70cm from a monitor in a well-lit room and underwent a calibration session for the eye-tracking software, Tobii Studio Pro. For the calibration, a small black disc moving randomly on the screen was shown. Participants were asked to follow the movement of this disc. If the calibration was not completed, the process was repeated. During the appreciation task, participants viewed each artwork (4,000ms) after a fixation point (500ms), followed by three sequential questions (no time limit) and a black screen (1,000ms). This process was repeated for all eight artworks in a random sequence. In tracking participants' eye movement during the appreciation task, Tobii-X120 and Tobii Studio Pro were applied. The eye tracking software followed eye movement to a rated accuracy of 0.5° with a sampling rate of 60Hz. The fixation event was stated by the Tobii fixation filter (I-VT filter) as when the gaze to a specific spot within 0.5° of the visual angles was fixed for at least 100ms. Overall procedures of the experiment are described in Fig 2.</p></div>

The models (1) and ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>) examined whether fluency and preference ratings were confounded by art-related knowledge and interest levels.

This algorithm is formulated as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">Spatial kernel (. ! ,0 ! ) = exp 5- x i 2 +y i 2 σ 2 6 (9)</formula><p>where σ denotes the distance threshold. The algorithm displayed a single cluster if the modes for each distribution were within the distance threshold. If the modes were beyond this threshold, it exhibited the top two clusters. We examined whether one of the two clusters contained the predefined AOI.

Also, regarding the stimulus N2, both groups' clusters contained the AOI specifically. In the cases of positive stimuli, both groups displayed distinctive patterns in gazing behaviors except for the stimulus P1.</p><p>Despite the variability among stimuli, these results imply a distinct spatial pattern of group-level attention. The experimental group paid attention to both AOIs and perceptually salient regions, but the control one fixed their eye movement in a dispersed way centered on the salient regions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>In this study, we examined the dual role of subjective fluency in the preference for visual artworks that evoke negative affect, based on the integrated HFM-FAM model. We also explored the cognitive mechanisms linking subjective fluency and preference, inspired by the PIA model. We hypothesized that participants who received contextual information about the artwork stimuli would engage in controlled processing (H1), which would be associated with high subjective fluency (H2). Additionally, we hypothesized that subjective fluency would increase preference (H3) and mitigate effect of valence on preference (H4). Our findings suggest that while contextual information facilitates controlled processing at eye movement level, this processing style does not significantly result in enhanced subjective fluency.</p><p>However, subjective fluency was found to increase preference and reduce the impact of valence on preference, supporting H1, H3, and H4, but not H2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Contextual information and controlled processing</head><p>The experimental group that read descriptive texts alongside the stimuli images focused more on perceptually peripheral but semantically relevant regions (i.e., AOIs) during the appreciation task, indicating controlled processing. This aligns with psycho-historical perspectives of aesthetic appreciation. For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Bullot and Reber (2013)</ref> proposed a threestage model of aesthetic appreciation: 'basic exposure', 'artistic design stance', and 'artistic understanding'. While the basic exposure phase is triggered by perceptual features of objects (e.g., size or shape), the artistic design stance requires historical knowledge, leading viewers to infer background information about the composition (e.g., authorship or style). This stance helps viewers progress to the final stage, artistic understanding, where they interpret the value of the composition and its emotional impact. Experimental studies have shown that contextual information, such as titles or descriptive texts, enhances viewers' artistic design stance and understanding, resulting in better appreciation <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Brieber et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Gartus &amp; Leder, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Swami, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Szubielska &amp; Sztorc, 2019)</ref>. These findings suggest that experimental participants engage more actively and thoughtfully in the appreciation task when provided with contextual information from descriptive texts.</p><p>In terms of information processing, the experimental group's gazing behavior reflects 'top-down' selection, driven by prior knowledge, as opposed to the 'bottom-up' selection in the control group, driven by perceptual features <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Itti &amp; Koch, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Katsuki &amp; Constantinidis, 2014)</ref>.</p><p>This top-down selection, characterized by controlled processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Shelton &amp; Scullin, 2017)</ref>, suggests that contextual information effectively motivates participants to engage in controlled processing, opening opportunities for disfluency reduction and stronger aesthetic preference.</p><p>Nevertheless, it should be noted that fixation metrics of the experimental participants to</p><p>AOIs might be overrated due to the experimental design in which they explored stimuli images before the main appreciation task so that they could identify AOIs a priori. To minimize the bias, our findings need to be examined based on the refined design protocol in which they are not exposed to artwork images before the main task.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Controlled processing and fluency dynamics</head><p>Our manipulation increased subjective fluency, but this effect was not mediated by the processing style reflected in gazing behavior, seemingly contradicting the PIA model. The This implies that fluency delta needs to be distinguished from resultant fluency in the relationship between controlled processing and aesthetic preference. For example, perceivers who initially felt high levels of fluency may still rate their subjective fluency high after appreciation without controlled processing (i.e., low fluency delta but high resultant fluency). In contrast, others who displayed extremely low levels of initial fluency would increase their fluent feelings through controlled processing, but their resultant fluency could still be lower than that of already-fluency individuals (i.e., high fluency delta but low resultant fluency). Considering that our measurement of subjective fluency corresponds to resultant fluency, it is necessary to compute fluency delta by also measuring participants' initial fluency levels to investigate the effects of processing style during art appreciation more precisely.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Subjective fluency and preference for displeasing artworks</head><p>The dual role of subjective fluency in influencing preferences for displeasing artworks supports previous findings in empirical aesthetics. Firstly, the positive effect of subjective fluency on preference aligns with the HFM prediction. Subjective fluency indicates successful understanding of a stimulus and provides confidence in the processing of that stimulus, thus contributing to hedonic feelings during appraisal <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Landwehr &amp; Eckmann, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Winkielman et al., 2003)</ref>. This hedonic marker influences beholders' preference ratings for an artwork, even if it initially evokes negative feelings.</p><p>Secondly, the protective effect of subjective fluency against the negative valence effects on preference challenges the FAM but aligns with some theoretical models in empirical aesthetics. The distancing-embracing model <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Menninghaus et al., 2017)</ref> and the model of aesthetic appreciation and judgment <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Leder et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr">Leder &amp; Nadal, 2014)</ref> emphasize the role of cognitive resources, including art expertise, in fostering less gut-dependent appraisals of artworks, especially those inducing negative emotions in modern art. Also, experimental studies have shown that cognitive factors such as art expertise <ref type="bibr">(Leder et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Silvia, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Van Paasschen et al., 2015)</ref>, motivation for cognitive enrichment <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Steciuch et al., 2021)</ref> and trait neuroticism <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Chamorro-Premuzic et al., 2010)</ref> buffer emotional reactivity in the appreciation of artworks. Our results highlight a unique aspect of art appreciation compared to processing ordinary stimuli in daily life.</p><p>What makes art appreciation different from daily object processing? One explanation is the aesthetic dimension of art appreciation. Influenced by Kantian and Schillerian ideas, contemporary philosophical and empirical aesthetics identify 'disinterestedness' as a key factor <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Hilgers, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Matherne &amp; Riggle, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Vandenabeele, 2012)</ref>. Disinterestedness contrasts with desire, as it is not driven by gut feelings or personal interest <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Guyer, 1978)</ref>. Instead, it involves contemplating the object and adjusting one's mental state to fit the external environment. In other words, "while desire is about making the world fit the mind, experiences with aesthetic dimension are about making the mind fit the world." <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Van de Cruys et al., 2024)</ref>.</p><p>This disinterested attitude aims at object-driven 'meaning construction', a potent source of aesthetic preference <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Ball et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Belke et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Belke et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Millis, 2001)</ref>. In this meaning-making process, the role of affective valence in preference assessment is reduced to being part of the ingredients of meaning construction rather than a direct source of preference.</p><p>For instance, the disgusting feeling evoked by the gruesome beheading scene in stimulus N3 is not a direct deterrent during disinterested processing but is used to highlight Abra's firm beliefs and actions, enhancing the overall theme and preference for the artwork. This argument clarifies the cognitive differences between art appreciation and daily object processing, suggesting critical considerations regarding the application of FAM in empirical aesthetics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations</head><p>Several limitations should be considered. First, a larger sample size and more trials are necessary to enhance statistical power and reproducibility. Additionally, participants with more diverse cultural backgrounds are mandatory to test the generalizability of our findings, considering the association between cultural variability and heterogeneity in appraisal patterns <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Darda &amp; Cross, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Kharkhurin &amp; Yagolkovskiy, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Mastandrea et al., 2021)</ref>. Second, the potential bias in the experimental group's fixation duration at AOIs need to be addressed by ensuring they do not see images prior to the main appreciation task. Third, real-time measurements of fluency would provide a more nuanced understanding of the relationship among processing style, fluency dynamics and preference ratings. Furthermore, neurophysiological tracking such as an electroencephalogram linked to the dynamics of fluency and valence during the appreciation task will be promising to integrate the brain-cognitionbehavior interactions in the art-related experiences.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>Notwithstanding these considerations, this study broadens the understanding of the relationship between fluency, valence, and preference in empirical aesthetics. Using an eyetracking approach, we found that prior information about the artworks facilitates controlled processing. Even though gazing behavior related to controlled processing was not directly related to subjective fluency levels, participants who engaged in controlled processing felt more fluent with the artwork stimuli compared to the control group who used automatic processing.</p><p>Complementing conventional instruction-based manipulation of processing style, our integrated approach of gaze tracking and self-reporting allows researchers to assess differences in processing style relative to fluency levels in a more nuanced manner. With this methodology, we evaluated the generalizability of fluency-preference models in the context of art appreciation.</p><p>The hedonic value of subjective fluency was observed in art appreciation as it is in ordinary contexts, but its amplifying effects in the valence-preference relationship were reversedweakening the valence effect. This finding suggests fundamental differences in cognitive processes between daily object processing and artwork appreciation. We anticipate that our work will motivate further studies to explore the source of this difference between ordinary object and artwork processing. a In Bayesian linear model, the existence of effects is mainly evaluated by probability of being positive/negativity (as known as 'probability of direction' or 'PD'). <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Makowski, Ben-Shachar, Chen, et al.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>P4 Background Knowledge</head><p>The painting describes a scene, where Belshazzar, who became the king of Neo-Babylonian Empire after Nebuchadnezzar, is throwing a feast.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Overall Description</head><p>Here we see gold and silver plates which were stolen from Jerusalem to be used in the feast. This was unacceptable behavior, since the plates used for holy occasions were stolen and moreover, reused as luxuries in one's feast.</p></div>

Experimental manipulation → Processing style: Does reading descriptive texts activate controlled processing for art appreciation? (experimental validation) H1. Yes. The experimental group displays significantly longer fixation duration on AOIs than the control group. Q2. Processing style → Subjective fluency: Does the effect of contextual information raise one's subjective fluency and this effect is mediated by processing style? (inspired by the PIA model) H2. Yes. The experimental manipulation increases subjective fluency, and this effect is mediated by fixation duration on AOIs. Q3. Subjective fluency → Preference: Does subjective fluency enhance preference for artworks? (inspired by HFM) H3. Yes. Subjective fluency is positively associated with preference ratings. Q4.

The PIA model emphasizes fluency delta -the change from initial to resultant fluency -as the main source of aesthetic liking. If resultant fluency is higher than initial fluent feelings (i.e., fluency delta &gt; 0), perceivers show aesthetic interest. Conversely, a negative delta value results in confusion.</figDesc></figure>
