<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Characterising the mechanisms underlying naturalistic defensive behavior remains a significant challenge. While substantial progress has been made in unravelling the neural basis of tightly constrained behaviors, a critical gap persists in our comprehension of the circuits that implement algorithms capable of generating the diverse defensive responses observed outside experimental restrictions. Recent advancements in neuroscience technology now allow for an unprecedented examination of naturalistic behaviour. To help provide a theoretical grounding for this nascent experimental programme, we summarise the main computational and statistical challenges of defensive decision making, encapsulated in the concept of critical intelligence. Next, drawing from an extensive literature in biology, machine learning, and decision theory, we explore a range of candidate solutions to these challenges. While the proposed solutions offer insights into potential adaptive strategies, they also present inherent trade-offs and limitations in their applicability across different biological contexts. Ultimately, we propose series of experiments designed to differentiate between these candidate solutions, providing a roadmap for future investigations into the fundamental defensive algorithms utilized by biological agents and their neural implementation. Thus, our work aims to provide a roadmap towards broader understanding of how complex defensive behaviors are orchestrated in the brain, with implications for both neuroscience research and the development of more sophisticated artificial intelligence systems.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>To survive and thrive, biological agents must avoid harm from immediate threats. Successful defence requires selecting appropriate actions-often very rapidly-using the correct motor commands to execute them, adapting to dynamic situations, and learning to avoid danger in the future. The high stakes, time pressure, and an unrelenting evolutionary arms race, render this challenge significantly different from those encountered in other domains of dynamic behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Cisek and Pastor-Bernier, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Gordon et al., 2021)</ref>, such as foraging and hunting, mating and parental care, or social and cultural activities. Autonomous artificial agents face similar problems when seeking to ensure survival (e.g. in airplanes) or dangerous events such as collisions (e.g. in self-driving cars) <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Egner, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b114">Khatib, 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b209">Todorov, 2004)</ref>, associated with the substantial field of real-time systems engineering <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">(Kopetz and Steiner, 2022)</ref>. In this review, we adopt the term "critical intelligence" to encapsulate the challenge of navigating this unique dilemma. In political and military contexts, where "intelligence" typically refers to knowledge, the term "critical intelligence" denotes information that demands immediate attention and action to avert danger. In contrast, within the fields of neuroscience and machine learning, "intelligence" is understood as a capability. Thus, we define critical intelligence as the ability to make decisions that are simultaneously complex, swift, and accurate.</p><p>Understanding how the brain achieves critical intelligence would address a fundamental neurobiological question, could help advance our understanding of maladaptive avoidance in clinical conditions, and inform the design of safe autonomous agents. However, experimental research into this question has long been hampered by practical constraints. For example, classical neuroscience paradigms make only a carefully selected set of behaviours meaningful, by restricting the environment and/or the available motor actions. This reduction in complexity simplifies the problem the agent faces <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Fanselow, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Fanselow and Lester, 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b146">Mobbs et al., 2009)</ref> to the extent that it can be solved by combining a small number of decision strategies. In particular, it will admit largely pre-specified, reflexive or model-free algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bach and Dayan, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b122">LeDoux and Daw, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b145">Mobbs et al., 2020)</ref>. In contrast, outside these constraints, a much larger array of defensive behaviors is reported in field research and behavioral studies <ref type="bibr">(Domenici et al., 2011a</ref><ref type="bibr">(Domenici et al., , 2011b;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Evans et al., 2019)</ref>. This has highlighted the sophistication and complexity of critical intelligence in many species <ref type="bibr">(Domenici et al., 2011a</ref><ref type="bibr">(Domenici et al., , 2011b;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Evans et al., 2019)</ref> including humans <ref type="bibr" target="#b196">(Sporrer et al., 2023)</ref>, using naturalistic virtual reality <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Brookes et al., 2023)</ref>.</p><p>Novel neuroscience methods such as neural imaging in freely moving animals <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">(Klioutchnikov et al., 2023)</ref> and humans <ref type="bibr" target="#b155">(O'Neill et al., 2025;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b170">Roberts et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b192">Snider et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b215">Topalovic et al., 2020)</ref> now allow relaxing constraints and investigating the neural generation of critical intelligence in more naturalistic situations. In this review, we seek to provide a conceptual scaffold to guide this nascent research field. This scaffold rests on two pillars. The first pillar is an analysis of the statistical and computational challenges that any biological or artificial agent would encounter when responding to a defensive situation. The second pillar is a collection of candidate solutions for these challengesmany of which have not been investigated for defensive scenarios in biological agents. Often, several computational solutions exist for the same problem, necessitating experiments to disambiguate these possibilities-we outline some such experiments in textbox 1.</p><p>Important structure for our discussion follows the levels of analysis programme laid out by <ref type="bibr" target="#b139">Marr &amp; Poggio (1977)</ref>, whilst emphasising that the best, i.e., the optimal computational solution, can be the enemy of the good. i.e., whatever a neurally-realizable algorithm can produce in real time (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>).</p><p>In other words, the joint demands of rapidity and sufficiency determine not only the type of behaviour required -i.e., the computational solution -but also the algorithm(s) and implementation(s) by which it can be found. This duality runs through our review -and implies that constraints of the (neural) substrate can significantly impact the ethological computations that evolution could have crafted and honed. Nevertheless, the levels of analysis provide a useful organizing principle, not the least because it allows us to discuss some of the multiplicity of solutions rather transparently.</p><p>After summarising the background of our approach, we first discuss the challenges associated with finding optimal defensive strategies (i.e., the computational level). These strategies might be stochastic and are often couched in structured, symbolic, terms. Next, we discuss challenges related to planning actual defensive behaviour (i.e., the algorithmic level), drawing on descriptions from neuroscience and psychology. Finally, we discuss learning without direct feedback, which poses its own computational demands. between multiple action options, many of which require delicate execution planning to be successful (longer arrows), while others can be executed rapidly. Some of these actions might be appropriate only under the current circumstances whilst others might be more robust when the environment changes. With infinite time, an optimal action could be found, but at least some of the options require rapid initiation. What the agent actually does will therefore depend not only on what is considered the most appropriate action (traditionally a computational level question), but also on which action can be found within the limited time available. This, in turn, depends on which algorithm the agent is actually using, which for many common scenarios and many species is as yet unknown. For example, an agent might plan just one action for the current situation (red trace, left-hand side) but could also make multiple action plans simultaneously, which might take more time but could potentially account for incoming information or changes of the environment, and thus be useful for the future (green trace, right-hand side).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Box 1: Disambiguating algorithms for critical intelligence using behavioral perturbations experiments</head><p>To understand the neural algorithms that compute behaviour, we suggest distilling candidate mechanisms in behavioural experiments. Such experiments should approximate the complexity of the problem space that the agent uses in a natural environment -they should be naturalistic. To distinguish candidate mechanisms that result in similar behaviour, experiments should perturb the natural environment in ways that make some algorithms fail, but not others.</p><p>Objective: Do agents maximise the probability of survival over a certain time horizon, or expected capture time? For example, in defending against a faster opponent in open territory, will they trade a close and insecure shelter against a far and even less secure shelter? Time horizon: Does initial energy expenditure change, when the duration of a flight path is extended beyond the anaerobic time horizon? Adaptability: Are agents able to change initial responses when an opponent abandons its pursuit, or when an additional opponent interferes?</p><p>Closed-loop control: Are agents able to integrate new information into their behaviour, and if so, which type of information? For instance, what happens if its field of view abruptly widens or clears, or if the likely results of its ongoing response change suddenly.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Robust actions:</head><p>In scenarios with multiple escape options, how early do agents commit to one of them?</p><p>Pre-planning: When a preferred escape route closes at the same time that a threat appears, does the agent still approach it? Hierarchical planning: Does the selection of escape paths depend only on shelter location or also on detailed characteristics, for example any time-consuming motor actions required to access a shelter? Anytime planning: In a prolonged predator-prey stand off, is the response to a sudden lurch of the predator as fast at different time points? Factorisation: When different response options have very different opportunity windows, can agents integrate this to find the overall best response?</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Learning from past experience:</head><p>To what extent does peer play, observation, or near-catch experience generalise to threat encounters with varying features such as speed, path, angle of approach, parts of the environment, or goals.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p>Biological agents are constrained by their neural hardware, which has evolved by happenstance in response to the demands of specific ecological niches. Ample anatomical and functional evidence suggests that many species are equipped with dedicated neural circuits that generate specific defensive behaviours <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bach and Dayan, 2017)</ref>. Examples are giant Mauthner cells eliciting an ultra-fast escape reflex in many fish and amphibians <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Bullock, 1984)</ref>, the oligosynaptic startle circuitry producing a protective withdrawal reflex in many mammals <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Davis, 2006)</ref>, and a specialised threat learning system in mammals <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">(LeDoux, 1995)</ref>. All of these systems deal (almost) exclusively with situations of threat. While such examples are abundant across the animal kingdom, they generally produce narrow and often short-term responses. It remains unclear how the continuous and complex defensive behaviour that characterizes many species in their natural habitat <ref type="bibr">(Domenici et al., 2011b</ref><ref type="bibr">(Domenici et al., , 2011a;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Evans et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b196">Sporrer et al., 2023)</ref> is generated. For the example of threat learning, there is ongoing debate about the extent to which this process is additionally supported by a generic reward learning system outside the most constrained laboratory paradigms <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">(Laing et al., 2024)</ref>. When it comes to more sophisticated and apparently goal-directed defensive behaviors, and their well-known adaptation over multiple time scales <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">(Lima and Dill, 1990)</ref>, the underlying neural systems remain largely elusive.</p><p>From a purely theoretical standpoint, many solutions for generating such complex behaviours appear possible. It seems reasonable to expect, on the one hand, that dedicated neural circuits subserve at least a subset of defensive behaviours, possibly beyond the systems already known. On the other hand, for organisms that occupy diverse habitats such as humans, it would be implausible to expect a dedicated neural circuit for every defensive situation they may encounter, implying that some functions will be realized by more general-purpose systems. Examples of such circuits also exist in model organisms, such as the tectospinal system in fish, which controls goal-directed locomotion not only during escape but across different behavioural goals <ref type="bibr" target="#b171">(Saitoh et al., 2007)</ref>. Interestingly, this raises a possibility that different behaviours are controlled by different systems, but might co-occur in some situations. Indeed, research in humans has suggested that what appears like a coherent escape sequence is subserved by different underlying systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b196">(Sporrer et al., 2023)</ref>. Such systems can typically be differentiated only by directed experimental manipulations, not by mere observation alone. These manipulations require theoretical considerations, including hypotheses about the inner workings of candidate algorithms or neural circuits that control behavior.</p><p>In the remainder of this article, we seek to provide a roadmap for this work by a thorough analysis of the unique statistical and computational challenges that agents face in defensive situations, with the goal of inspiring theoretical and empirical research on how different species solve these challenges.</p><p>We also draw potential solutions from a rich computer science, engineering, and computational neuroscience literature. These should be regarded as selected set of candidates, to be confirmed or refuted in empirical research. We are not yet in a position to propose implementations of these solutions in neural circuits, largely because the novelty of the required experimental neuroscience methods has limited the extent of research on the neural substrate. Thus, instead, we focus on algorithms. Of course, we do not claim that these algorithms are "implemented" in neural circuits in a directly representational sense <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Brette, 2019)</ref>. Instead, the required computations might well be carried out in distributed dynamical systems with no notion whatsoever of the quantities that appear in an abstract algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Churchland and Shenoy, 2024)</ref>. Thus, the algorithms we propose here provide an idealised, abstract description of how behaviour is generated, and a benchmark against which to compare the output of a (simulated) neural model <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Bialek, 2022)</ref>. They can also be used for comparison to artificial agents in a signature testing approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b203">(Taylor et al., 2022)</ref>.</p><p>Two of the critical terms and concepts that appear throughout the review are that of a state and of a policy. The state characterizes the situation of the agent in terms of the environment, its history of its own interactions with that environment, and internal factors such as hunger and thirst. The policy is a mapping from states to actions, and, as the key determinant of success and failure of the agent, is the ultimate target of information processing. Critical tradeoffs exist between the speed, efficacy and complexity of computing different policies. As a result, both artificial and natural agents enjoy several structurally different mechanisms for generating, and then arbitrating between, policies.</p><p>The simplest policy is to map states of the (perceived) external environment directly to actions -this is often called a reflexive algorithm. As an especially simple case, a reflex (e.g. the startle reflex) is a policy that takes only a small part of the environment into account and is largely insensitive to the remaining sensory input <ref type="bibr" target="#b234">(Yeomans et al., 2002)</ref>. An agent might switch between different reflexive algorithms depending on some internal variables -this type of control has been described as "behavioural algorithms" <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">(Hein et al., 2020)</ref>. In general, reflexive algorithms might be hard-wired but they could also be learned from experience. One way of learning them is model-free reinforcement learning. This simply increases the probability of an action in a certain environmental state if this action leads to a desirable outcome <ref type="bibr" target="#b206">(Thorndike, 1911)</ref>. Reflexive algorithms can also be acquired by 'fixing' the output of initially more sophisticated learning mechanisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Gershman, 2020)</ref>. These types of transferred reflexive policy are often called "habits" <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Dickinson and Balleine, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Dolan and Dayan, 2013)</ref>.</p><p>In contrast, a reflective algorithm entails an explicit consideration of the agent's goals, the outcomes of its actions, and the utility of these outcomes in relation to the agents' goals <ref type="bibr" target="#b142">(Mattar and Lengyel, 2022)</ref>. The emergence of reflective algorithms entails learning and updating a model of the environment, often termed model-based learning.</p><p>There are three important considerations for this picture. First, the distinction between reflexive and reflective algorithms should be thought of as ends of a spectrum rather than a pair of categories <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Collins and Cockburn, 2020)</ref>. For example, even "simple" reflexes such as the startle reflex appear modulated by internal estimates of the state such as prior expectations or opportunity costs <ref type="bibr">(Bach, 2015a)</ref>. Second, much work in the field assumes that states and actions are discrete, but the actual environment is continuous. Generalising discrete state algorithms to continuous environments is the subject of intense theoretical research (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b191">Smith et al., 2020)</ref>. Finally, the common assumption of a completely known state is a simplification, and a fuller characterization is provided by partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDP). This is an important construct in computer science, albeit one without fast or general solutions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The computational level: Defining optimal defensive response strategies</head><p>Even with ample resources, identifying the best, or even a good, defensive strategy poses crucial challenges inherent in the problem setting. The computational level provides a third-person perspective, where we are not concerned with how the solutions are actually achieved (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>). The main challenges are what the objective of a defensive action should be and when it should be emitted, how to behave under uncertainty, and how to outwit one's opponent.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Specifying the objective and optimising response timing</head><p>The first challenge is combining multiple objectives (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2a</ref>). The primary goal of the agent is survival, but agents will often have to balance short-term and long-term survival. For example, in foraging under risk of predation, organisms may trade a small chance of short-term death for resources that facilitate long-term survival <ref type="bibr" target="#b232">(Ydenberg and Dill, 1986)</ref>. Thus, the challenge here is balancing contradictory objectives. Different computational solutions have been proposed (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Enkhtaivan et al., 2023)</ref>. A popular solution is scalarisation -mapping the different goals onto a scalar objective function, such as a loss function in Bayesian decision theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Berger, 2013)</ref>, a utility function in expected utility theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Bernoulli, 1738;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b175">Savage, 1954;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b219">von Neumann and Morgenstern, 1944)</ref>, a drive function in homeostatic reinforcement learning <ref type="bibr">(Keramati and</ref><ref type="bibr">Gutkin, 2011, 2014)</ref>, or an assumed objective in allostatic control <ref type="bibr" target="#b179">(Sennesh et al., 2022)</ref>. However, as yet, there exists no normative way of constructing such objective functions from the organism's needs. Instead, they are usually inferred from behaviour (e.g. choice preferences) <ref type="bibr">(e.g., von Neumann and Morgenstern, 1944)</ref> or derived from physiological data (e.g. capacity) (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b179">Sennesh et al., 2022)</ref> data. Besides scalarisation, a second solution is selective attention -addressing different goals one at a time <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Enkhtaivan et al., 2023)</ref>. Finally, heuristic objective functions have been proposed, such as capture time <ref type="bibr" target="#b222">(Weintraub et al., 2020)</ref>, probability of success <ref type="bibr" target="#b231">(Wynn et al., 2015)</ref>, or minimum threat distance <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Cooper Jr., 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b106">Kawabata et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b194">Soto et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>A related consideration is the time horizon over which the objective is optimized. For example, extended defensive responses pose particular demands on energy expenditure. To avoid interception, an agent may have to perform intense movements rapidly. However, repeated or prolonged efforts will lead to exhaustion and later vulnerability <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(Guinet et al., 2007)</ref>. With limited energy reserves, agents must balance them carefully to ensure the quality of their performance and secure their overall escape <ref type="bibr" target="#b136">(Mandralis et al., 2021)</ref>. Behaviourally, at least for simple actions, it appears that energy demands of a movement are integrated with the rewards it affords <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Cos et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b182">Shadmehr et al., 2016)</ref>, thus making it likely that the agent has a notion of energy expenditure in their decision-making.</p><p>Computationally, the time horizon is implicitly encoded in the discount factor of (homeostatic) reinforcement learning models; but in this framework it is usually treated as a free model parameter and inferred from behaviour, rather than specifying how the agent generates this parameter. There is work on optimizing the energy demands of single actions on the fly and in a distributed system <ref type="bibr" target="#b209">(Todorov, 2004)</ref>. This concept typically does not afford a priori estimates of the energy cost of different complete defensive responses. On the other hand, an agent might attempt to calculate the energy cost of chunks of sub-sequences <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Balleine and Dezfouli, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b212">Tomov et al., 2020)</ref>, to allow overall energy needs to be approximated.</p><p>The next challenge is determining optimal response timing (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2b</ref>). For example, when circled by a bird of prey, an agent might quickly decide on a dodge response, but may choose to withhold it until the bird enters the ballistic attack phase during which it cannot change its own trajectory any longer <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Evans et al., 2019</ref>, see for a similar situation <ref type="bibr">Bach, 2015b)</ref>. In contrast, responding early might be beneficial in other situations but energetically costly <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Dayan, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b151">Nord et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b181">Shadmehr, 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Moreover, as often the case in embodied decision-making, different actions might enjoy different windows of opportunity, such that their optimal timing differs <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Cisek and Pastor-Bernier, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Gordon et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>Computationally, an agent needs a form of temporal prediction to integrate its beliefs about potential performance, energy levels and opponent's behaviour. While conceptually straightforward, this can quickly lead to intractable problem set-ups; we discuss algorithmic solutions in the next section. The two actions in the first state (left circle) need to be taken at different times (for example, escape needs to be started when the opponent is far whereas a fight is only effective when the opponent is near enough). C. Uncertainty in the outcome tree compels information-gathering. Here, this is depicted by a specific action (the magnifying glass) in the first state. D. Uncertainty can also favour robust actions, such as movement trajectories that can be diverted later, illustrated here by the red line segment in the first state. E. Adaptability is required when new information arises during an action. For example, an agent may realise that a specific action will lead to an unforeseen outcome (dashed red line), and revert to a different action (red arrow) that was not part of the initial plan. F. Whilst a prey organism is planning its response, the opponent might form a mental model of the prey and prepare for the prey's most likely action sequence.</p></div>

Some of these strategies were explicitly developed for defensive scenarios, notably in the framework of differential game theory. However, they have been devised for low-dimensional or discrete choice scenarios. In realistic circumstances, the worst state of the environment might not be known even on a phylogenetic level, a fact that can be exploited by "rare enemies", such as tentacled snakes <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Catania, 2011)</ref>. In the face of such ignorance not just about the state of the environment but about its underlying structure, a computational solution is "robust planning", i.e. finding the best policy under the worst possible version of the environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Buffet and Aberdeen, 2005)</ref>.

We discuss the challenges with online adaptation in the next section; here we focus on a priori specification of adaptable actions.</p><p>Empirically, adaptability manifests in many different ways. First, responses can be made adaptable during the period of decision, preparation, or waiting for the optimal time point, as in ongoing postural preparation and trajectory adaptation before response initiation <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Card and Dickinson, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b115">Kimura et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b218">Turesson et al., 2009)</ref>, energisation of locust hindlegs whilst movement trajectory preparation with frontlegs is ongoing <ref type="bibr" target="#b173">(Santer et al., 2005)</ref>, or adaptation of lizard escape timing to changes in opponent speed <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Cooper Jr, 2006)</ref>.

Closed-loop control requires specification of several characteristics. One is the selection of monitorable features of the environment, balanced against the cost of collecting this information. For instance, visual monitoring of a predator during escape might require costly trajectories or head turns; auditory monitoring might be a cheaper but less precise alternative. Another feature is determining adjustable motor plans, such as choosing a speed that provides appropriate manoeuvrability <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">(Howland, 1974;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b231">Wynn et al., 2015)</ref> or setting fixed safety margins <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">(Hasson et al., 2012)</ref>. This entails mathematically rich and mechanically challenging trade-offs <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">(Li, 2017)</ref>. A notion of energy expenditure is also required to avoid exhaustion. Finally, rapid adaptability can be facilitated by parallel planning for, and arbitration between, multiple scenarios, such that cached alternative plans can be rapidly retrieved during action execution <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Cisek, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Gallivan et al., 2018</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Gallivan et al., , 2015))</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Game-theoretic considerations</head><p>A final challenge comes from game-theoretic considerations in agent-opponent interaction (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2f</ref>). Empirical examples are deceptive signalling <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Caro, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Cooper, 1998)</ref> and protean, i.e. unpredictable, behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Evans et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Humphries and Driver, 1970)</ref>. The latter is particularly relevant if a predator moves faster than the prey, and can save the latter from otherwise certain death even though further reducing speed. Empirically, unpredictable tactics are used in the selection <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Arnott et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Domenici et al., 2008)</ref> and execution <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Domenici and Hale, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b104">Jornod and Roche, 2015)</ref> of behaviour in many species and can depend on threat characteristics <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">(Herbert-Read et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b200">Storms et al., 2019)</ref>.

More sophisticated strategies can be found using differential game theory tools under incomplete information <ref type="bibr" target="#b222">(Weintraub et al., 2020)</ref>, or by adapting POMDP models to multi-agent settings <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Gmytrasiewicz and Doshi, 2005)</ref>, although practical solutions might only ever be approximately correct.</p><p>Overall, the computational challenges outlined can be grouped into two categories. One encompasses strategic choices that partly depend on the biophysics of the body and the capacities of the neural system. These can be solved prior to a threat encounter, and might well be hard-wired from birth or during development: determining action objectives and time horizons, robustness and adaptability, and a broad attitude towards opponents. Within these strategic settings sit other challenges that comprise tactical decisions, many of which must be flexible from situation to situation: computing optimal response timing and actual robust plans, adapting behaviour online, and implementing appropriate game-theoretic responding. How this could be achieved under time pressure is the topic of the next section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The algorithmic level: Selecting the defensive response</head><p>Even if it is possible to specify an optimal strategy, substantial further demands are imposed by the need to determine the actual responses and adapt them online. Of course, an agent can opt to respond with reflexive input-output relationships to a specific set of sensory signals without analysing the remaining environment, such as reflexes <ref type="bibr" target="#b234">(Yeomans et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr">Bach, 2015a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Domenici and Hale, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b122">LeDoux and Daw, 2018)</ref>, and other relatively stereotypical behaviours <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bach and Dayan, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b140">Marras and Domenici, 2013</ref>). An agent might also prioritise certain sensory patterns for detailed perceptual and mnemonic processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Bach et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b132">LoBue et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b177">Schmidt-Daffy, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b236">You and Li, 2016</ref>). Yet another reflexive strategy is to seek out or avoid attractive and repulsive parts of the environment respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b186">(Shi et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b228">Woodbury, 1986)</ref>. Extending such ideas, Hein et al.</p><p>(2020) provide a revealing analysis of behavioural algorithms: a small set of reflexive input-output relationships that provide adaptability at run time, and are relatively straightforward to select between.</p><p>However, there is by now much evidence that even seemingly simplistic escape-to-shelter behaviour in mammals depend on a detailed assessment of the environment, including the trajectory and identity of the opponent <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Evans et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b196">Sporrer et al., 2023)</ref>. This results in a tree of possible actions and responses that expands into the future, which necessitates some forms of planning <ref type="bibr" target="#b142">(Mattar and Lengyel, 2022)</ref>. Reflective algorithms require resources and therefore inflict their own challenges. Indeed, compromises between optimal and satisficing <ref type="bibr">(Simon, 1955)</ref> will typically be necessary -the confounding of <ref type="bibr" target="#b139">Marr &amp; Poggio (1977)</ref>'s levels mentioned above.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reducing complexity</head><p>A primary challenge of action planning in many situations involves rapidity. Regardless of the agent's current activity or level of preparation, it must often react promptly to ensure survival <ref type="bibr" target="#b220">(Walker et al., 2005)</ref>. Thus, ongoing behaviour must be interruptible to enable the selection and execution of an appropriate escape response, and these new actions must be selected quickly. Moreover, windows of opportunity for some -but not others -of the available actions might already close during the decision process <ref type="bibr" target="#b168">(Reynaud et al., 2020)</ref>. While the neural system has ways to accelerate decision processes, such as invigoration <ref type="bibr" target="#b137">(Manohar et al., 2015)</ref> and specialised low-latency circuits <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Bullock, 1984)</ref>, rapidity will often require appropriate reduction of the complexity (but therefore also, quality) of online planning (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>). More generally, this is a necessity even without time pressure: agents in real-world scenarios operate in open environments with near-infinite possibilities that all but preclude the application of classical near-optimal algorithms such as exhaustive tree search <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Gordon et al., 2021)</ref> even given a focus on the worst cases (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Lecarpentier &amp; Rachelson, 2019)</ref>. Factorisation. An agent might first decide on an action, and separately, on its implementation parameters such as optimal timing. F. Continuous updating. As new information arrives (green arrows), an initial plan (red trace) needs to be updated (green trace), preferably without having to recompute the entire action sequence.</p><p>Many algorithmic methods have been suggested to this end (albeit mostly in appetitive rather than aversive domains), and likely are collectively employed and combined given the difficulty and importance of the problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Collins &amp; Cockburn, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Feher da Silva &amp; Hare, 2020)</ref>. Here, we group them into five categories: offline (pre-)planning, hierarchical planning, sparse planning, anytime planning, and factorisation.</p><p>First, agents may take advantage of epochs before a threat appears <ref type="bibr" target="#b145">(Mobbs et al., 2020)</ref> or has yet to attack <ref type="bibr">(Roelofs &amp; Dayan, 2023)</ref> to pre-plan or adjust counterfactual strategies (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3a</ref>). Periods of quiet wakefulness (e.g., during consumption of food in a currently safe environment or embedded in a larger group <ref type="bibr" target="#b169">(Roberts, 1996)</ref>) or sleep (e.g., after spending time in an environment that is likely to be revisited) have been suggested as the ideal time during which to leverage a world model in order to build an effective policy that can be executed reflexively when the need arises <ref type="bibr" target="#b201">(Sutton, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr">Momennejad et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b141">Mattar &amp; Daw, 2018)</ref>. Mice appear to memorize spatial subgoals during exploration, and escape towards them even when the environment has changed, indicating preplanning <ref type="bibr" target="#b183">(Shamash et al., 2021)</ref>. Similarly, complex escape routes in mice improve with prolonged exposure to the spatial context <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Claudi et al., 2022)</ref>. There are various versions of offline-trainable reflexive policies, including behavioural habits <ref type="bibr">(Dickinson &amp; Balleine, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr">Gershman et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Gershman, 2020)</ref> and model-free methods from reinforcement learning <ref type="bibr">(Daw et al., 2005)</ref>.

On a cognitive level, chunking (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3b</ref>) could help roll out entire action sequences in predictable environments <ref type="bibr" target="#b230">(Wu et al., 2023)</ref>, which may manifest as inflexible habits <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Balleine and Dezfouli, 2019)</ref> to achieve subgoals (Q. J. <ref type="bibr">Huys et al., 2015)</ref>. Subgoals are particularly useful if the environment contains a hierarchical structure, in which action planning could progress from coarse to fine levels of detail over time <ref type="bibr" target="#b212">(Tomov et al., 2020)</ref>. Neural and neurally-inspired theories have posited that that planning not only takes place in hierarchical temporal order, but simultaneously in a hierarchically structured (neural) planning system. Here, higher levels of a neural processing hierarchy set subgoals for lower levels, which are then achieved rather autonomously <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Friston, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b161">Pezzulo and Cisek, 2016)</ref>. Subgoals that involve reaching desired future states can usefully be formalised as behavioural affordances <ref type="bibr" target="#b161">(Pezzulo and Cisek, 2016</ref>). The motor system faces the related problem that the abundance of degrees of freedom complicates forward planning. Similar hierarchical principles offer a solution, with the selection of motor goals being partially independent of the planning for their implementation <ref type="bibr" target="#b143">(Merel et al., 2019)</ref> and with the latter again proceeding somewhat autonomously, for instance by changing the reference points of reflex arcs <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">(Latash, 2021)</ref>. This would then involve the periphery outside the central nervous system in the planning.</p><p>Next, given the impossibility of optimal planning, some of the many forms of satisficing <ref type="bibr">(Simon, 1955)</ref> and resource- <ref type="bibr" target="#b127">(Lieder &amp; Griffiths, 2020)</ref> and bounded- <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Devaine et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b164">Prystawski et al., 2022)</ref> rationality will apply to sparsify the decision tree (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3c</ref>) and reduce its complexity <ref type="bibr">(Huys et al., 2015)</ref>.

For example, the affordance competition hypothesis posits that (at least mammal) agents maintain a continuous representation of currently available motor plans <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Cisek, 2007)</ref>. However, such strategies are limited by physical <ref type="bibr" target="#b138">(Marois and Ivanoff, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b211">Tombu et al., 2011)</ref> and informational bottlenecks <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">(Koechlin and Hyafil, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b148">Musslick and Cohen, 2021</ref>) that would likely differ across species and environments.</p><p>To summarize, the primary algorithmic challenges of critical intelligence involve an effective reduction of complexity and continuous adaptation in the face of uncertainty. The reduction of complexity, in particular, poses a danger as it goes against the demands of optimality. Instead of aiming for the best response, the agent will seek to find a satisfactory response based on certain criteria. It seems plausible to assume that the choice of algorithm(s) is hard-wired at birth or during development; but given the evident sophistication even of the simplest defensive behaviours, many of the actual computations will have to be performed online. Thus, our analysis shifts the focus from delineating a hard-wired set of defensive behaviours to highlighting a hard-wired set of algorithms to compute behaviour. Neuroscience is only now equipped with the technology to investigate naturalistic behaviour in such circumstances.</p><p>A final aspect of adaptability is offline adaptation -after a threat encounter has been survived. In the next section we discuss what the potential strategies are to this end.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Learning without direct experiences</head><p>To improve survival odds, defensive responses should be adapted to those environments and predators that an animal might encounter, and such adaptation occurs on multiple time scales <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">(Lima and Dill, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b196">Sporrer et al., 2023)</ref>. Here, we focus on how an agent can harness threat encounters in order to learn better survival strategies prior to the next encounter. Critical to this process, agents must adapt their response without directly experiencing complete failure. Observing conspecifics in the same situations. C. Learning from near-catch experiences. In each case, a mental model of the environment is constructed from the experience, and then adapted and generalised such as to be applicable in an actual threat encounter.</p><p>The first method of learning without direct experience is generalising from safe experiences (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4a</ref>). In the absence of actual deadly experiences, an agent can emulate them. For instance, by engaging in play fights with its peers, such as rough-and-tumble play in many mammals <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Fagen, 1976;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b195">Spinka et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b224">Weller et al., 2020)</ref>, agents may practice defense against conspecifics. Similarly, mice appear to learn escape paths from spontaneous escape attempts in the absence of threat <ref type="bibr" target="#b183">(Shamash et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>Computationally, this can be achieved through two complementary strategies, transferring knowledge from one situation to another and broadening the range of experiences to draw from. In the former, internal models are fine-tuned to a specific situation, like wrestling with peers, and adjusted to account for another, different but comparable situation, like fighting an opponent. Cognitive maps and computational models of the hippocampal and entorhinal systems are interesting candidates for such a process <ref type="bibr" target="#b210">(Tolman, 1948;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b152">O'Keefe et al., 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Eichenbaum, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b225">Whittington et al., 2020)</ref>, alongside less biological approaches for artificial systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b223">(Weiss et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b150">Niu et al., 2020)</ref>. The latter strategy consists of seeking a variety of training scenarios, encompassing various opponents, tactics, and environmental conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Bell et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b172">Salvanes et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b205">Tetzlaff et al., 2019)</ref>.</p><p>Curiosity-driven algorithms can achieve such behaviour through intrinsic goals and self-evaluation processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Gottlieb et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b204">Ten et al., 2021</ref>), yet they are typically not evaluated in threat scenarios. Finally, agents can also generalise from one threat to another <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Anson and Dickman, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Griffin et al., 2001)</ref>.</p><p>The second method of learning without direct experiences is learning from observation (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4b</ref>).</p><p>Observing an interaction between a conspecific and its opponent, without any direct interaction, provides critical information about the opponent's approach strategy and any potential deceptive tactics. In turn, this information can fine-tune one's own defensive strategies, for instance, by paying more attention to opponents' potential hideouts. Behaviourally, it is well-known that various mammals use this type of information, evidenced for example by conditioned responses after observing Pavlovian conditioning in a conspecific, something that requires anterior cingulate to amygdala projections in rodents and probably also in humans <ref type="bibr" target="#b154">(Olsson et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b190">Smith et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>However, the challenge here is assessing the other agent's experiences indirectly. During observation, the observer might have information that it does not when threatened itself (e.g. due to a different view angle), and also the threatened agent might have information that the observer does not when threatened itself (e.g. due to different initial threat responses). Thus, the challenge is to adjust defensive strategies based on indirect scenarios analogous to actual experiences of the threat.</p><p>Interestingly, besides observation, parental influences might also be transmitted more directly, i.e. via hormonal or epigenetic means <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Atherton and McCormick, 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Computational approaches to this problem have been proposed in robotics and AI research <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">(Lu et al., 2018)</ref>. Through imitation of their parents and peers, for instance, an agent could emulate and train defensive responses, while minimising risks. Complementarily, an agent can simulate what could have alternatively happened during an encounter <ref type="bibr" target="#b141">(Mattar and Daw, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b201">Sutton, 1990)</ref>, potentially using replay to learn from memorised observations <ref type="bibr" target="#b158">(Panoz-Brown et al., 2018)</ref>, and adjust its future defensive response accordingly, for instance by strengthening a reflexive response to stimuli.</p><p>The third method of learning without direct experiences is learning from near-catch experiences (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4c</ref>). Almost being caught is the closest to a negative example an agent can get during its lifetime. More generally an agent can extend its notion of loss to adverse situations that could have led to death, such as engaging in a fight, being hurt or simply being too close to a predator. However, unlike classical reward-maximisation scenarios, adjustment steps must be chosen carefully to avoid any worse outcomes.</p><p>Computationally, an agent can rely on constrained optimisation algorithms' mechanisms. Variations of a strategy can then be tested within the realm of safe and known responses. After repeated approaches, different species of grasshoppers for instance, gradually adjust their escapes based on their species' characteristics, either strengthening their jump or hastening their flight <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Bateman and Fleming, 2014)</ref>. The difficulty is then to adjust the intensity of the constraint with the risk of a future encounter. A dramatic near-catch would call for a strong response change. Again, offline simulation processes, like the DYNA algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b141">(Mattar and Daw, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b201">Sutton, 1990)</ref>, could provide such estimates by gradually widening the range of simulated scenarios.</p><p>To summarise, agents can employ several strategies to learn from indirect experience. Given ubiquitous observation in mammals of rough-and-tumble play, vicarious learning, and adaptation immediately after threat encounters, it is likely that all of them are used to some extent. However, it is less clear how they might be efficiently and effectively implemented on an algorithmic or neural level. This resonates with our general theme, which we expand on in the next section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Towards understanding neural implementation</head><p>The neuroscience of defensive behaviour has traditionally focused on finding neural circuits that implement protective and defensive reflexes <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Bullock, 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Davis, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b221">Walters et al., 1981;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b234">Yeomans et al., 2002)</ref>, or stereotypical defensive behaviours such as freezing, undirected escape, passive avoidance and the choice between them, recently using sophisticated circuit-mapping techniques in mice (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Herry et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Fadok et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b109">Kennedy et al., 2020)</ref> and flies <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Duistermars et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Gibson et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b147">Mohammad et al., 2016)</ref>. Because these types of behaviours take a relatively small part of the sensory environment as an input, they can be elicited in well-controlled laboratory circumstances, sometimes even with head-fixed animals. While this has generated impressive insights, these fall short of explaining the sophistication of defensive behaviour in mammals in more naturalistic settings <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Domenici and Hale, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Evans et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b196">Sporrer et al., 2023)</ref>, including the many continuous parameters of behaviours. We argue that understanding this large action space requires a novel approach; both in terms of the research paradigms, and in the level of theory. Our analysis of the environmental demands and the potential computational and algorithmic solutions highlights what we should be looking for in the neural system: not circuits that implement particular behaviours, but rather circuits that implement particular algorithms, which flexibly decide between various behaviours and continuously compute and update their parameters.</p><p>Because this research programme is only just beginning, we can but give a brief overview of emerging ideas in this field. Some literature has addressed relatively threat-specific circuits in mice that implement partly preplanned escape to shelter <ref type="bibr" target="#b183">(Shamash et al., 2021)</ref> from a rapidly expanding overhead disc <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Evans et al., 2018)</ref>. This research has identified circuits for maintaining important decision variables. First, the spatial target, i.e. shelter orientation, is tonically represented in specific neurons in superior colliculus and retrosplenial cortex <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Campagner et al., 2023)</ref>. Second, a race-to-threshold mechanism in superior colliculus has been described for eliciting escape, regardless whether elicited by visual or auditory input <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Evans et al., 2018)</ref>, with the threshold for this mechanism implemented in dorsal periaqueductual gray <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Evans et al., 2018)</ref>. This threshold is under modulatory control by GABAergic interneurons <ref type="bibr" target="#b197">(Stempel et al., 2024)</ref>, while the accumulation process in superior colliculus is modulated by input from ventral lateral geniculate nucleus, which signals contextual variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Fratzl et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>Taken together, this suggests a dedicated circuit for flexible escape responses, which appears to integrate pre-planning of details, an evidence accumulation process for elicitation, and lack of a detailed environment model at run-time in what appears as open-loop phases.</p><p>Regarding the neural implementation of goal-directed behaviours, there is a scarcity of research in defensive situations. More generally, cortical and hippocampal replay <ref type="bibr" target="#b153">(Olafsdottir et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b158">Panoz-Brown et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b162">Pfeiffer and Foster, 2013)</ref>, is a suitable candidate for offline preparation and learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b141">(Mattar and Daw, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Gagne and Dayan, 2022)</ref>. Hippocampal replay might also be a mechanism of forward simulation of a decision tree. For example, replay of spatial paths has been observed in relation to the future locations that an animal will visit <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Ferbinteanu and Shapiro, 2003)</ref>.</p><p>Potentially indicating the same mechanism, in the vicinity of previously fear-conditioned locations, replay of paths towards these locations (which are behaviourally avoided) has been shown <ref type="bibr" target="#b229">(Wu et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p>However, these are suggestions based on scarce evidence or through analogies. To make headway, it will be important to collect neural observations in freely moving animals and humans; technology that has recently become available. Given that critical neural computations are performed in distributed, partially-modular, populations <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Basu et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Churchland and Shenoy, 2024)</ref>, a particular focus on observing large numbers of neurons appears warranted.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>Investigating the sophistication of defensive behaviour entails experiments that actually afford such sophistication -requiring that we provide agents with complex, naturalistic environments, in which they have many and continuous action choices. The technology for such experiments has only recently become available, marking the beginning of a long and exciting journey into the realm of critical intelligence in biological agents.</p><p>As a backdrop, our review focused on abstract, computational and algorithmic, challenges of defensive behaviour. Our analysis highlights two main points. First, as generally in naturalistic environments, it is practically impossible to compute optimal behaviour, due to the large state and action spaces. However, second, unlike more general instantiations of embodied decision-making, the problem setting also constrains the algorithms that can be used to compute behaviour. For just one instance, since exploration is not an option in the face of lethal threat, the onus is on robust actions and adaptability, both in real time and after the encounter. A central theme emerges: approximating ideal responses through heuristics that balance safety and practicality. With this review, we intend to provide a roadmap for the empirical programme of characterising these heuristics: first, by narrowing down the focus of neural experiments; secondly to provide benchmark solutions from the wider machine learning and computational neuroscience literature against which neural data and simulations can be evaluated.</p><p>Importantly, distinguishing between different heuristics from observations alone can be difficult <ref type="bibr" target="#b142">(Mattar and Lengyel, 2022)</ref>. For example, different reflective, tree-search, algorithms converge to similar solutions, given sufficient time or adequate state spaces (a many-to-one mapping). At the same time, the interplay between a specific algorithm and different reflexive strategies could obscure some of its specific characteristics (a one-to-many mapping). In general, there are two ways of solving this conundrum. The first is to leverage neural observations, in order to find those algorithms that are actually implemented in the neural system <ref type="bibr" target="#b142">(Mattar and Lengyel, 2022)</ref>. The caveat here is that we lack ground truth as to how the brain computes behaviourally relevant outputs and therefore, which neural features to record and analyse. Important discoveries have often been made in rather constrained experiments, where the instantaneous state of the system is more easily defined externally. In naturalistic environments, which are required for this research programme, it will often be unclear a priori what the neural system's goals are at a specific time. Knowing (or hypothesising) a specific algorithm that it might use can then guide scientific discovery.</p><p>The second possibility for distinguishing candidate algorithms is to use behavioural perturbation experiments: systematically creating situations in which only specific algorithms fail, while others succeed. This can provide a broad overview as to which features an algorithm uses. Historical examples are detour tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b210">(Tolman, 1948)</ref> or devaluation experiments <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Dickinson and Balleine, 1994)</ref>.</p><p>Similar ideas have been used to investigate the structure of algorithms for defensive behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bach, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b196">Sporrer et al., 2023)</ref>. This has revealed, for example, that while reflexes and reflexive behaviour do exist across the animal kingdom including humans, they do not account for the majority of observed defensive behaviour in many mammalian species <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Evans et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b196">Sporrer et al., 2023)</ref>.</p><p>In textbox 1, we summarise conceptual suggestions as to how to investigate some of the mechanisms proposed in this article. Importantly, for simple defensive responses it is well-known that different species use different algorithms, and there is no reason why this should not be the case for more complex behaviour. Thus, knowledge of the ecological niche in which a species is operating might help elucidate suitable candidate algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">(Kavaliers and Choleris, 2001)</ref>.</p><p>It is important not to forget additional constraints on the planning and execution of behaviour. For instance, the reason why certain defensive responses are non-interruptible <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">(Kimura et al., 2022</ref>) could be biomechanical (ballistic movements) and/or neural (open-loop control). Equally, biological agents have to navigate continuous state and action spaces -an area which is poorly explored over and above rather simple motor actions. There is a suggestion that behaviour is altogether composed of discrete elements, such as motor primitives on a fine-grained level <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Chiovetto et al., 2022)</ref>, or behaviour syllables on a coarser level <ref type="bibr" target="#b227">(Wiltschko et al., 2015)</ref>. Such a hierarchical scheme might enable largely discrete planning, but the evidence that such discrete elements are used for action planning is limited.</p><p>One potential source of computational and algorithmic ideas for critical intelligence comes from the broad fields of real-time systems engineering <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">(Kopetz and Steiner, 2022)</ref> and what are known as cyberphysical systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b131">(Liu et al., 2017)</ref>. These directly address the engineering challenges associated with operating effectively and safely within the constraints of realized physical systems, and offer an extensive body of theory and practice that could directly inform our understanding of biological systems.</p><p>In conclusion, this article provides a roadmap for advancing critical intelligence research in naturalistic environments, by identifying the most challenging computational and algorithmic issues and reviewing potential statistical solutions. To bridge the gaps in our understanding of their neural implementation, it is essential to conduct naturalistic neuroscience experiments. Although these experiments are more complex to control than traditional methods, they provide invaluable insights into crucial natural processes that extend beyond current computational theories that were based on constrained settings.</p></div>
