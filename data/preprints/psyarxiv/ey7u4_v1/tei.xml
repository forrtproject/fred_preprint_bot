<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Creativity is fundamentally a collaborative process. Yet as generative AI becomes increasingly integrated into creative work, understanding how AI reshapes collaboration has become critical. This pre-registered study directly compares human-human and human-AI collaboration dynamics across two creative tasks: the Alternative Uses Task (AUT) and creative short story writing. Participants were randomly assigned to pairs in either human-human (N = 68 pairs) or human-AI (GPT-4o; N = 72 pairs) conditions, with partners alternating turns as first responders to examine how initiation order shapes the creative process over time. Our findings reveal that the apparent "AI advantage" in creative collaboration is illusory, driven primarily by increased AI verbosity rather than enhanced creativity. Critically, collaboration with AI partners negatively impacted humans' own creative responses compared to human-human partnerships, with human-AI collaboration failing to enhance idea originality or diversity relative to human-human collaboration. Human partners demonstrated superior collaborative effectiveness that strengthened over time, indicating that current generative AI systems, while producing more verbose outputs, do not replicate the collective creativity characteristic of human-human collaboration. These results challenge assumptions about AI's creative potential, with direct implications for AI system design and collaborative creative practice.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>A total of 208 participants were recruited from Prolific for the study. The number of participants were based on a power analysis performed with the pwr package in R, based on a between-subjects design. For an independent two samples t-test with a small effect size (d = 0.35), a significance level of 0.05, and a power of 0.8 to minimize Type II errors, a minimum sample size of 65 pairs per group was required to detect a statistically significant difference. Upon taking part in the study, participants were randomly assigned to either a human-AI (72 pairs) or human-human (68 pairs) condition. In exchange for their participation for 30 minutes, participants received $6.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Materials and Procedure</head><p>Participants completed two collaborative tasks, a verbal creativity task, and several questionnaires. Upon clicking the study link, they were first presented with the consent page, and could only proceed after providing consent. The experiment was administered on Qualtrics, while the collaborative tasks were hosted on a custom external website. The matching of human participants was performed using the SMARTRIQS platform, a free, open-source tool for interactive Qualtrics experiments involving communication between multiple human participants or chatbots <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Molnar, 2019)</ref>.</p><p>Participants were instructed they would be taking part in a turn-taking collaborative creativity study. For collaborative tasks, participants were randomly assigned to either Role A or Role B, and that role persisted throughout the tasks. Participants assigned to Role A would initiate the turn-taking interaction, while Role B would go second. Prior to taking part in the collaborative tasks, participants were explicitly told whether they were assigned to the human-AI or human-human condition. They were also given a chance to practice using the platform with their partner by taking turns to complete the sentence 'this', 'is', 'a', 'practice'. Role A would start with 'this' and alternate with B until the sentence is completed. Next, participants completed two trials of the Alternate Uses Task (AUT) and a short story writing task, taking turns to provide a response. After finishing the collaborative tasks, each participant individually completed a test of verbal creative ability; then, they answered a series of questions regarding their perception of their partner and their general perception of AI. Finally, they answered personality and demographic questions. All experimental tasks were administered on Qualtrics, while the matching of human participants was performed using the SMARTRIQS platform</p><p>ChatGPT-4o. The study used prompt engineering to engage ChatGPT-4o as a creativity collaborator in the human-AI condition, tasking the model with generating original ideas for both the Alternative Uses Task (AUT) and creative short story writing. This means prompts were carefully designed with explicit constraints and instructions, so that it served as a creative and useful collaborator in the relevant tasks. The model was accessed via the OpenAI API through PythonAnywhere, by hosting a custom chat interface that was designed to visually match the human partner condition (see Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 1. Chat interface</head><p>Note: This figure is a screenshot of the collaboration platform.</p><p>This interface was embedded into Qualtrics as an external website, ensuring a seamless and consistent user experience across both AI and human interaction modes. To standardize interaction timing and match it to the human-human condition, controlled response delays were implemented based on pilot testing. For the AUT, a 5-second delay was implemented between the participant's prompt and ChatGPT-4o's response, while a 10-second delay was imposed for the creative short story writing task. These delays ensured that variations in creativity outcomes were attributable to the nature of the collaboration rather than technical speed of the AI's response.</p><p>Alternate Uses Task (AUT). The AUT measured divergent thinking by asking participants to generate as many creative uses as possible for an everyday object in 3 minutes <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Guilford, 1967)</ref>. Before starting, participants received instructions emphasizing turn-taking and collaboration. Participants were also urged to "be creative" when responding <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Acar et al., 2020)</ref>. The task began with the participant in Role A (or the AI in Role A) submitting an initial response. The participant in Role B would then contribute their own idea, after which it was again the turn of the participant in Role A, and so on. Participants completed the task twice, for two different objects: bottle and book. Originality of AUT responses was assessed using Cross-Lingual Alternate Uses Scoring (CLAUS), a transformer model fine-tuned to match human ratings, hosted on The Creativity Assessment Platform (CAP; <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Patterson et al., 2025)</ref>.</p><p>Creative Short Story Task. In the creative short story task, participants construct a narrative based on a given set of three words ("stamp-letter-send") and alternate with their partner (human or AI) to develop a coherent story, contributing one sentence per turn. Participants were given a total of 10 minutes to complete the story. Divergent semantic integration (DSI; <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Johnson et al., 2022)</ref> was used as a calculation of the story's creativity by computing the semantic distance between all pairs of words in the story text. A higher DSI score reflects greater integration of semantically diverse ideas within narratives and higher originality.</p><p>Verbal Creative Thinking Ability. To assess each individuals' baseline level of verbal creative thinking ability, the Divergent Association Task (DAT) was used. In this task, participants are asked to generate 10 unrelated words (excluding proper nouns and technical terms) "that are as different from each other as possible, in all meanings and uses of the words" <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Haase et al., 2025;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Olson et al., 2021)</ref>. Participants were given unlimited time to complete the task. Responses were analyzed using pairwise cosine distance comparisons using GloVe and a model that was pretrained on the Common Crawl corpus. The average semantic distance across all word pairs multiplied by 100 to yield the final DAT score. Higher scores indicate greater semantic divergence between words, reflecting stronger verbal creative ability. To account for the AI partner's baseline creative capacity in our multilevel model, we derived a DAT score for ChatGPT-4o using an established protocol <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bellemare-Pepin et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Cropley, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Hubert et al., 2024)</ref>. See SI 1 for further protocol details.</p><p>Perceptions of Partner, Task, and AI. Partner perceptions were assessed across multiple dimensions to capture participants' evaluations of their collaborative experience. Three single-item measures evaluated partner characteristics: creativity (1 = Not at all creative to 7 = Exceptionally creative), cooperativeness (1 = Not at all cooperative to 7 = Extremely cooperative), and ease of collaboration (1 = Extremely difficult to 7 = Extremely easy). Feelings of interpersonal connection were measured using a four-item scale adapted from previous research on human collaboration <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Fowler et al., 2024)</ref>, with participants rating their agreement (1 = Strongly disagree to 7 = Strongly agree) with statements including "I like my partner," "I value my partner," and "I feel connected to my partner." Additionally, participants indicated their perceived relationship closeness using the Inclusion of Other in Self scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Aron et al., 1992)</ref>, selecting from seven increasingly overlapping circle diagrams representing the degree of connection with their creative partner.</p><p>To verify participant attention and manipulation awareness, attention check questions were administered. Participants were asked to identify whether they were told they were working with another human participant or AI based on the study instructions, and separately to report their own perception of their partner's identity. An honesty check inquired whether participants used external internet or AI resources during the study, with assurance that responses would not affect their compensation. Participants' data were removed if they admitted to using external internet or AI resources not provided to them during the course of the study.</p><p>Finally, participants' general attitudes toward AI were assessed using an 11-item scale measuring two positive and negative dimensions of AI perception <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Sundar, 2020)</ref>. The scale included items evaluating AI's machine-like qualities such as "AI has machine-like precision," "AI is error free," and "AI has machine-like accuracy," as well as items assessing perceived human-like characteristics including "AI is able to detect human emotion," "AI has human-like subjective judgements," and "AI has human intuition." Additional items measured perceptions of AI rigidity, including "AI is unyielding," "AI is rigid," and "AI is mechanistic." All AI perception items were rated on a 7-point scale indicating how well each term described participants' thoughts about AI.</p><p>Personality and Demographics. Participants also completed brief personality and demographic questionnaires. Personality, in particular openness to experience, was measured as it tends to be positively associated with creativity. It was measured using a brief 10-item scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Rammstedt &amp; John, 2012)</ref> adapted from the Big Five Inventory <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(John &amp; Srivastava, 1999)</ref>, with items assessing key traits (e.g., "I see myself as someone who… is reserved", "…has an active imagination") rated on a 5-point Likert scale (1 = Strongly disagree to 5 = Strongly agree). The scale included items representing openness (e.g., artistic interests, imagination), extraversion (e.g., reserved, outgoing), conscientiousness (e.g., thoroughness, laziness), agreeableness (e.g., trusting, fault-finding), and emotional stability (e.g., relaxed, nervousness). Demographic information was collected via self-report, including age, gender, race/ethnicity, highest educational qualification, and whether English was their first language.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Analysis</head><p>Alternate Uses Task (AUT). Responses for the AUT tasks were aggregated (bottle and book). The lme4 and lmerTest packages in R were used to test the mixed-effects models for originality (hypothesis 1) and elaboration (hypothesis 3). Diversity was measured in two ways: Levene's text for the variance differences in AUT originality scores, and forward flow (hypothesis 2). All models controlled for individual creativity (DAT score) and accounted for nested random effects of pairs and participants.</p><p>Hypothesis 1 was tested by comparing the originality of ideas between AI and human collaborations, with AI expected to generate more novel combinations.</p><p>Hypothesis 2 predicts that human collaborations will produce more diverse ideas than AI collaborations due to their varied cognitive starting points. This will be assessed using forward flow analysis to quantify flexibility and semantic distance. Forward flow analysis calculates semantic distance (via cosine similarity) between consecutive ideas in a sequence, thereby indexing how conceptually distinct each new idea was from previous ones. To run the analysis, a multilingual sentence transformer model (paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2) was used to quantify conceptual similarity between consecutive responses within each participant group. For each group, responses were sorted by running sequence and pairwise semantic distances were calculated between adjacent responses using cosine similarity of sentence embeddings. The semantic distance was computed as one minus the cosine similarity between consecutive response embeddings, where higher values indicate greater conceptual divergence, enabling quantification of semantic flow patterns within each participant's response sequence.</p><p>Hypothesis 3 expects AI collaborations to yield higher elaboration (word count), as AI can rapidly expand ideas with detailed explanations.</p><p>Creative Short Story Task. Pre-registered analyses focused on originality and diversity. Both the Human-Human and Human-AI diversity contribution score distributions violated normality (Shapiro-Wilk test: Human-Human W = 0.856, p &lt; 0.001; Human-AI W = 0.946, p = 0.004). Given these violations, we used the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test (Wilcoxon rank-sum test) to compare central tendencies between conditions, rather than Welch's t-test which assumes normality. The two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test compares the entire distributions (shape, location, and scale).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participant Demographics</head><p>Participant demographics, including age, race, gender, education, and language background, are summarized in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. A chi-square test of independence showed a statistically significant association between gender and condition, χ 2 (2, N = 208) = 8.07 p = 018). However, this result was driven by the low-frequency 'Other/Unspecified' category (n = 6 total), which was higher in the AI collaborator condition (6.9%) than human collaborator (0.7%). No differences were observed for Female (58.3% vs. 52.9%) or Male (34.7% vs. 46.3%). Hence, we proceed with the assumption that there is no practical difference between the groups for the purposes of subsequent analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Alternate Uses Task (AUT)</head><p>Originality. First, we tested hypothesis 1, whether human-human collaboration differed from human-AI collaboration in creativity. On average, pairs in the human-human condition produced a total of 10 responses (book: 9.81; bottle: 10.20) with 3.34 words per idea, while pairs in the human-AI condition produced 11.7 responses (book: 11.80; bottle: 11.50) with 12.7 words per idea. Humans in the paired group had an average DAT score of 75.4 while the humans in the AI group had a DAT score of 76.7.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> shows a summary of the effects of condition (human-human vs human-AI) and participant role (role A or role B) on the prediction of AUT response originality. Three nested multi-level models with random intercepts for group ID and group ID nested within response ID were fitted. All models included DAT as a scaled covariate to control for individual verbal creativity effects. Fluency is the total number of ideas for each pair.</p><p>The pre-registered model (with random slopes for condition by groupID and random intercepts for groupID and groupID:ResponseId) failed to converge, even after uncorrelating random effects. A reduced model with only the random slope for condition by groupID also failed. The final and successfully converging model include only random intercepts for groupID and the nested groupID by ResponseId term: originality ~ condition * role + dat_scaled + (1|groupID) + (1|groupID:ResponseId), data) The base model (Model 1) revealed a significant main effect of condition. The Human-Human condition showed a negative effect (B = -0.065, SE = 0.007, t = -9.69, p &lt; .001), while participant role B had a small but significant positive effect (B = 0.018, SE = 0.004, t = 4.22, p &lt; .001). Additionally, a significant interaction between the Human-Human condition and participant role B was observed (B = -0.021, SE = 0.007, t = -2.87, p = .005), suggesting that the effect of condition varied depending on participant role. The scaled DAT score covariate (dat_scaled), measuring individual verbal creativity, was also significant (B = 0.021, SE = 0.002, t = 9.67, p &lt; .001). These results indicate that being in the human-AI collaboration condition is, especially in role B, was associated with higher originality scores. However, scaled DAT score suggests that independent of the condition or role, higher verbal creativity also predicts higher originality scores.</p><p>Model 2 incorporated additional covariates including item type, fluency, and word count to control for potential confounding variables: item type (book and bottle), fluency (number of ideas for each pair), and word count. The addition of these covariates substantially improved model fit (REML = -6579.2 vs. -5750.7). Notably, the inclusion of covariates eliminated both the main effect of condition (B = 0.010, SE = 0.008, t = 1.28, p = .201), and the condition × participant role interaction (B = 0.002, SE = 0.006, t = 0.24, p = .814). The scaled DAT score (dat_scaled) continued to have a positive effect (B = 0.0078, SE = 0.0019, t = 4.02, p &lt; .001). Among additional covariates, word count emerged as a strong predictor (B = 0.009, SE = 0.0003, t = 31.61, p &lt; .001), while item (Bottle) showed a slight negative effect (B = -0.0069, SE = 0.0029, t = -2.43, p = .015), fluency was marginally significant (B = 0.001, SE = 0.001, t = 1.80, p = .072). This implies that, after controlling for word count (a robust predictor) and other covariates, there was no difference between AI and human partners, there was no difference in whether one's partner was AI or human.</p><p>To specifically examine the effect of role in interactions in only human responses, we conducted an analysis excluding all AI-generated responses (Model 3). In this restricted sample, the condition effect re-emerged as significant (B = 0.0293, SE = 0.0104, t = 2.83, p = .005), with human-human pair showing more originality. Importantly, this effect was the opposite of the pre-registered analysis. However, the condition × participant role interaction remained non-significant (B = 0.0119, SE = 0.0106, t = 1.12, p = .263), suggesting that partner role did not substantially moderate the effect of condition. Among covariates, fluency (B = 0.0026, SE = 0.0009, t = 2.97, p = .003) became significant in this model, while DAT scores were no longer significant (B = 0.0019, SE = 0.0023, t = 0.80, p = .425).</p><p>Thus, contrary to the pre-registered findings, human collaborators were linked to higher originality when AI-generated responses were excluded, implying that AI responses may have previously masked underlying differences in human responses (see Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>). To ensure that these results were not due purely because of comparison between two versus single person in the human-only model, the analysis was re-run with randomly selected humans in the human-human condition to compare with the human in the human-AI condition. Results were largely the same, with humans in the human condition scoring higher than the human in the AI partner condition, B = 0.027, SE = 0.011, t(175.5) = 2.518, p = .013).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 2. Interaction between condition and participant role for AUT originality score</head><p>Diversity. Hypothesis 2 asks, does working with human vs AI creative partners produce more diverse ideas? To test this, two analyses were performed. First to examine the range of originality score, and second to use forward flow analysis to examine the semantic distance per idea from the previous. Levene's test for homogeneity of variance was used to examine the range of originality score.</p><p>For the first analysis using the median as the center, Levene's test indicated a marginal significant difference in the variance of scores between the two conditions, F(1, 3036) = 3.72, p = .054. However, removing the AI's responses indicated no difference, F(1, 2132) = 0.15, p = .70. This implies that the differences in the range of scores were predominantly driven by the AI's responses (see Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>.).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 3. Comparing diversity of AUT originality scores between condition with score variance</head><p>For the second analysis with forward flow, a linear regression analysis examined semantic distance across idea sequence position (1st idea to last idea produced) between collaboration conditions, with data truncated to the first 20 ideas per pair to ensure more equivalent comparison between the conditions. The model revealed a significant main effect of running idea sequence (B = -0.002, SE = 0.001, t = -2.20, p = .028) and a significant interaction between condition and running sequence (B = 0.004, SE = 0.002, t = 2.43, p = .015). As shown in figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>, Human-AI pairs demonstrated decreasing semantic distance over time, while Human-Human pairs showed increasing semantic distance across the sequence. The main effect of the condition was not significant (B = 0.003, SE = 0.013, t = 0.23, p = .818), which indicates that while the overall semantic distance did not differ between conditions, the trajectory of idea diversity varied significantly, with human-AI pairs exhibiting more convergent thinking and human-human pairs showing more divergent thinking over time.</p><p>The results from the model that removed AI's response ideas are identical to the analysis that included the AI responses. The model revealed a significant main effect of running sequence (B = -0.002, SE = 0.001, t = -2.20, p = .028) and a significant interaction between condition and running sequence (B = 0.004, SE = 0.002, t = 2.43, p = .015). The main effect of the condition was not significant (B = 0.003, SE = 0.013, t = 0.23, p = .818). Human participants in Human-AI pairs demonstrated relatively stable semantic distance over time, while humans in Human-Human pairs showed increasing semantic distance across the sequence. These results suggest that the observed patterns reflect differences in human ideation processes over time between the two conditions. Elaboration. Hypothesis 3 asks if AI partners were wordier than human partners. As indicated in the pre-registration, the linear mixed-effects model that examined elaboration (word count) with condition, participant role, and scaled DAT score as predictors initially failed to converge due to a gradient issue. The final simplified model, which removed the random slope for condition entirely and retained only random intercepts for groupID and the nested groupID:ResponseId structure, successfully converged: word count ~ condition * participant role + dat_scaled + (1|groupID) + (1|groupID:ResponseId) Results across all three variations of the model remain consistent (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>). The initial model (N = 2,970 observations) with condition, participant role, scaled DAT score, and condition x participant role interaction revealed significant effects for all predictors (ps &lt; .001) with a negative Human-Human condition effect (B = -7.08, SE = 0.55, t = -12.79) and positive participant role effect (B = 2.56, SE = 0.24, t = 10.71). There were also significant positive effects for the scaled DAT score (B=2.12, SE=0.14, t = 14.73, p&lt;.001) and a condition × role interaction (B = -2.44, SE = 0.47, t = -5.20, p &lt;. 001).</p><p>When adding item type and fluency covariates (N = 2,970), the model showed comparable effects with significant negative fluency effects (B = -0.31, SE = 0.05, t = -5.88, p &lt; .001) and positive Bottle item effects (B = 0.71, SE = 0.18, t = 3.97, p &lt; .001). It maintained similar effects for the scaled DAT score (B = 2.09, t = 14.78, SE = 0.14, p &lt; .001) while showing a slightly stronger interaction (B = -2.56, SE = 0.46, t = -5.51, p &lt; .001). The human-only subset model (N = 2,066) showed stronger condition × role interaction (B = -3.15, SE = 0.69, t = -4.55, p &lt; .001) and non-significant DAT score effects (p = .956). This means that there is a robust condition and role effect in the human-AI condition.</p></div>

We tested hypothesis 1 on whether human or AI collaborators different in originality performance on the creative short story task. Following the model indicated in the pre-registration, a linear mixed-effects model was conducted to examine the effects of condition and participant role on prediction accuracy, controlling for scaled DAT and accounting for random effects of group ID. The initial model revealed a significant intercept (B = 0.812, SE = 0.005, t = 151.86, p &lt; .001), indicating high overall prediction accuracy. No significant main effects were found for condition (B = -0.006, SE = 0.008, t = -0.79, p = .431) or participant role (B = 0.003, SE = 0.007, t = 0.43, p = .667), and the scaled DAT covariate was not significant (B = 0.001, SE = 0.003, t = 0.26, p = .795). The interaction between condition and participant role approached significance (B = -0.019, SE = 0.010, t = -1.83, p = .070). However, when word count was added to the model, it emerged as a significant predictor (B = 0.0002, SE = 0.00006, t = 4.05, p &lt; .001), with higher word counts associated with increased prediction accuracy. With the inclusion of word count, the interaction between condition and participant role became significant (B = -0.020, SE = 0.010, t = -2.03, p = .045), indicating that the effect of condition on prediction accuracy differed significantly depending on participant role, while main effects for condition (B = 0.006, SE = 0.008, t = 0.72, p = .472) and participant role (B = 0.006, SE = 0.007, t = 0.86, p = .393) remained non-significant (see Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 6. Interaction between condition and participant role for originality of short stories</head><p>Diversity. We then tested hypothesis two in whether the diversity of stories differed between human and AI collaborators. The Mann-Whitney U test comparing diversity contribution scores between Human-AI (n = 72 pairs) and Human-Human (n = 68 pairs) conditions found no significant difference in central tendencies (U = 2674, p = 0.347). However, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test examining overall distributional differences yielded a marginally non-significant result (D = 0.217, p = 0.061), suggesting potential differences in distribution shape or spread that warrant further investigation with larger sample sizes (see Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>).</p><p>Exploratory forward flow analysis with the sequence of sentences in the creative short story task revealed no main effect of running sequence (B = 0.001, SE = 0.001, t = 1.70, p = .089) and a significant interaction between condition and running sequence (B = 0.003, SE = 0.002, t = 2.08, p = .038). As shown in figure <ref type="figure">7</ref>, human participants in Human-AI pairs demonstrated relatively stable semantic distance over the sentence sequence, while humans in Human-Human pairs showed increasing semantic distance across sentences. The main effect of condition was not significant (B = 0.005, SE = 0.016, t = 0.28, p = .777). The overall model was significant (R² = .014, F(3, 1762) = 8.60, p &lt; .001). These results parallel the AUT idea forward flow analysis, indicating how partner type could shape semantic progression in both constrained (AUT) and open-ended (story-telling) creativity tasks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 7. Comparing diversity of short stories between condition</head><p>Elaboration. Hypothesis 3 asks if elaboration is different with a human or AI collaborator. As indicated in the pre-registration, a separate linear mixed-effects model was conducted to examine elaboration (word count), operationalized as story word count, with condition and participant role as predictors, controlling for scaled DAT and accounting for random effects of group ID. The model revealed a significant intercept (B = 133.36, SE = 5.34, t = 24.97, p &lt; .001), indicating substantial baseline word count. A significant main effect of the condition emerged (B = -48.38, SE = 7.68, t = -6.30, p &lt; .001), with human-human interactions producing significantly fewer words compared to the AI condition. Additionally, there was a significant main effect of participant role (B = -12.04, SE = 5.59, t = -2.15, p = .033), indicating that role B participants used fewer words than role A participants. The scaled DAT covariate was also significant (B = 8.44, SE = 2.61, t = 3.24, p = .001), suggesting that word count increased for participants with higher verbal creativity. However, the interaction between condition and participant role was not significant (B = 7.14, SE = 8.05, t = 0.89, p = .377), indicating that the effect of condition on elaboration did not differ significantly between participant roles. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p>The present study contributes to our understanding of collaborative creativity by providing evidence for the advantages and limitations of human-human versus human-AI collaboration. Three key hypotheses were examined: 1) Human-AI collaboration produces more original responses, 2) Human-Human collaboration yields higher diversity, and 3) Human-AI collaboration produces more elaborate outputs. For hypothesis 1, a consistent finding is that human-AI collaboration appears beneficial to originality, until we control for verbosity, then humans had worse performance. For hypothesis 2, human-human pairs showed greater semantic diversity over time, and whether a human or AI collaborator starts first impacted the originality of the creative short stories and their elaboration. Finally for hypothesis 3, human respondents in the AI collaboration wrote longer responses than participants in the human collaboration. Collectively, our results point to a potential tradeoff: AI collaboration may increase output volume but reduce originality and diversity compared to human partnership. Hypothesis 1: Originality AUT. Supporting our first hypothesis, human-AI collaboration seemed to generate more original ideas than human-human collaboration, but this benefit disappeared -and even reversed -once the verbosity of the ideas was factored in. Initial analyses with AUT responses suggest AI collaboration enhanced originality, consistent with findings that AI systems can generate more novel ideas than humans (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Hubert et al., 2024)</ref>, and previous research indicating that AI collaboration increases the originality of creative products <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Hubert et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">B. C. Lee &amp; Chung, 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Luchini et al., 2025;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Urban et al., 2024)</ref>. However, this apparent advantage disappeared when controlling for response length, fluency, and item-level effects. The initial "AI advantage" appears to be an artifact of AI's tendency to produce longer, more elaborate responses. This is aligned with literature highlighting AI's 'elaboration bias' when scored by another AI <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Tang et al., 2024)</ref>, where longer responses are scored more favorably and higher on originality. Indeed, when excluding AI contributions, human-human collaboration was shown to produce more original responses than humans in the human-AI collaboration. One possibility is that participants in the human-AI collaboration engaged in cognitive offloading -a reliance on external systems to reduce mental effort and engagement. Generating creative responses is inherently effortful, and humans, as cognitive misers, often seek to minimize cognitive load when possible <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Barr et al., 2015)</ref>. Individuals across all working memory capabilities engage in cognitive offloading as a strategy <ref type="bibr">(Morrison &amp; Richmond, 2020)</ref>. When AI provides readily available suggestions, humans may default to less effortful engagement in the task. This aligns with recent work indicating that frequent genAI usage is associated with weaker critical thinking abilities, worse learning outcomes, and even de-skilling <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Budzyń et al., 2025;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Gerlich, 2025;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Kosmyna et al., 2025;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">H.-P. (Hank)</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Lee et al., 2025;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Oakley et al., 2025;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Skulmowski, 2023)</ref> and reduced recall of specific information with enhanced memory of where to access them instead <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Sparrow et al., 2011)</ref>. A recent Harvard Business Review coined the term 'workslop', when individuals use genAI to offload cognitive work to colleagues downstream, leading to a cascade of effortful decoding, inference, and complex decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Niederhoffer et al., 2025)</ref>. Creativity requires engaging in both associative and executive processes that are slow and effortful, and participants acknowledge that using AI makes tasks feel easier <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Tang et al., 2024)</ref>.</p><p>Creative short stories. In creative short stories, no difference was found in originality, but starting first was associated with being more creative (role A) only in the human-human collaboration condition. The different findings between AUT and creative short stories likely reflect differences in their cognitive demands. The AUT requires generating multiple discrete ideas that can be evaluated independently for novelty <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Guilford, 1967)</ref>. In contrast, creative storytelling, like discourse production, demands some level of narrative coherence and thematic unity, requiring ideas to work together as an integrated whole rather than as separate creative outputs <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Kintz et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Marini et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Patel et al., 2024)</ref>.</p><p>Human collaborators will relinquish creative agency to other humans, but not to AI. This is evidenced by a study where Role B participants produced less original content only when partnered with a human, effectively taking a "backseat," while their output remained stable when partnered with an AI. This divergence is likely due to perceived social differences that only activate during human-to-human collaboration, as AI is not treated as a true social peer. Neuroscientific evidence shows reduced activation in mentalizing networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Chaminade et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Montag et al., 2023)</ref>, relevant for social-cognitive processes, when dealing with AI, indicating they're not processed as social partners. Behavioral data confirms lower engagement and physiological arousal compared to human-to-human interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Lim &amp; Reeves, 2010)</ref>. Unlike the AUT where an individual's responses do not necessitate building upon or interacting with each other, a collaborative creativity writing task requires one to take the lead in guiding the narrative direction. Furthermore, humans resist the AI taking a leading role in turn-taking tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Winston &amp; Magerko, 2017)</ref> and base their trust and willingness to collaborate on their perception of the AI's agency <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Sundar &amp; Liao, 2023)</ref>. These findings underscore that in creative collaborative tasks, factors like the partner's perceived social status and the order of creative initiation significantly influence human willingness to contribute or defer.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hypothesis 2: Diversity</head><p>Our second hypothesis that human collaboration will be more diverse was supported. While we observed a wider range of originality scores for human-AI pairs in the AUT at first, this was, once again, driven by the presence of AI's responses, as the effect disappeared when excluding AI responses from the analysis. In both the AUT and creative short story, forward flow analysis showed increasing semantic jumps in human collaboration. A potential explanation is that the current AI systems may lack the capacity to elicit the type of conceptual leaps that leads to progressively divergent idea evolution over time. A recent study supports this finding in that AI usage trends towards homogeneity over time, calling it a 'creative scar inked in the temporal creativity trajectory' <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Zhou et al., 2026)</ref>. This may be related to the AI's tendency towards excessive agreement with its users, which is also known as 'sycophancy' <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Malmqvist, 2024)</ref> When a collective story is written by multiple individuals, questions arise about equivalence of contribution, engagement, and leadership. However, systematic reviews on generative AI show a consistent theme: human agency and ownership are still central to directing any creative work <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Heigl, 2025)</ref>. In collaborative storytelling contexts such as with role-playing games, players have been found to show higher verbal creativity <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Chung, 2013)</ref>, suggesting that routine structured and engaged collaborative creativity can enhance individual creative capacities. In such collaborative story-telling, individuals may pick the elements that other players have put forward and develop them further, or choose to ignore certain parts of them. On the other hand, LLMs function more as a monolithic, non-curating entity that does not have creative intent. For a narrative to be cohesive and compelling, the author must propel the story forward in a series of logical steps of cause and effect. Because LLMs operate through probability-based generation and lack creative intentionality or understanding outside their training data <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bender &amp; Koller, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Chamberlain et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Felin &amp; Holweg, 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Hicks et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">McCormack et al., 2019)</ref>, for the story to be cohesive, humans would need to act as the essential curators, editors, and intentional directors of the narrative, providing the cohesive thread of cause and effect and novel creative direction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hypothesis 3: Elaboration</head><p>Lastly, our third hypothesis received strong support for both AUT and creative short stories: AI as a creative partner greatly increased the length of human responses, even when analyzing only human contributions. This effect was particularly pronounced for Role B in the AUT and Role A in the creative stories. This pattern may be explained through the anchoring effect, a well-established cognitive bias where initial information serves as a reference point that influences subsequent judgments and behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Furnham &amp; Boo, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Tversky &amp; Kahneman, 1974)</ref>. In the context of creative collaboration, AI responses may have provided extensive elaboration that served as response length anchors, prompting human participants to match or exceed this standard of length. At first glance, this seems to contradict humans' reluctance to cede narrative control, but the two stem from different psychological mechanisms. The anchoring effect boosts output quantity/elaboration, not control, with participants often mistaking length for quality.</p><p>The study's findings yield three principal practical implications. First, in contexts aimed at fostering creativity and learning, the use of AI requires careful consideration, as human-AI collaboration can promote cognitive offloading, thereby diminishing original cognitive engagement and potentially undermining learning outcomes despite enhancing output elaboration. Second, the evidence affirms the enduring value of human-human collaboration for creative endeavors, as it sustains greater semantic diversity and mitigates the trend toward creative homogeneity observed with AI over time. Finally, and crucially, these insights demand that organizational leaders eschew a blanket "AI everywhere" mandate and instead formulate explicit, strategic policies for its use; relegating such decisions to individual employees without guidance reflects a lack of discernment and risks the indiscriminate application of AI to unsuitable tasks, ultimately privileging output volume at the expense of true originality and creative diversity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations and Future Directions</head><p>Several limitations of the present study warrant consideration and suggest important avenues for future research. First, our findings are limited to specific creative tasks (AUT and creative storytelling) and may not generalize to other forms of collaborative creativity such as problem-solving, design thinking, or artistic creation. Future studies should examine these dynamics across a broader range of creative domains to establish the generalizability of our findings. Second, while we observed different effects for human-AI and human-human partnerships, our study did not directly examine the underlying cognitive mechanisms that may explain these differences. Future research should investigate the role of shared mental models -cognitive representations of task requirements, partner capabilities, and collaborative processes -in mediating the effectiveness of different collaboration types <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Cannon-Bowers et al., 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Mathieu et al., 2000)</ref>. Understanding how humans develop and maintain shared mental models with AI partners compared to human partners could provide crucial insights into the mechanisms underlying our observed effects. Third, our study focused on immediate creative outputs rather than longitudinal creative development, leaving questions about how these collaboration effects evolve over extended periods. Future longitudinal studies could examine whether the cognitive offloading effects we observed in human-AI collaborations persist, adapt, or intensify with prolonged interaction, and whether shared mental models become more sophisticated or remain fundamentally limited in human-AI contexts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusion</head><p>This study reveals that human-AI collaborative creativity produces fundamentally different outcomes compared to human-human collaborations. Our findings demonstrate that AI collaborations do not guarantee enhanced originality; instead, controlling for verbosity results in worse originality in humans. This suggests cognitive offloading in human participants, where individuals rely on AI-generated content to reduce their own mental effort and creative engagement. While humans produce longer responses when working with AI partners, this may be due to anchoring effects from AI's elaborate outputs. In contrast, human-human collaborations promote continuous exploration of semantic space over time and foster hierarchical relationship dynamics that encourage sustained cognitive engagement. Notably, humans appear unwilling to yield agency in collaborative story-telling with AI, whereas in human collaborations, they more readily let the starting partner take the lead. These findings suggest that the apparent benefits of AI collaboration may come at the cost of reduced human creative engagement, highlighting the importance of designing AI tools that promote active cognitive engagement rather than passive reliance. As AI systems become increasingly prevalent in creative workflows, understanding these cognitive offloading effects will be crucial for preserving human expertise.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 4 .</head><label>4</label><figDesc>Figure 4.
