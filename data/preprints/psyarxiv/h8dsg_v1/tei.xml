<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Recognising and responding to task-relevant stimuli may be hindered by nearby task-irrelevant flanker stimuli. Such effects occur both in visual crowding and in Flanker Compatibility Effects (FCE). Whereas crowding is a visual phenomenon that reflects a breakdown of object recognition in clutter, the FCE in the Eriksen flanker task is thought to be due to conflict during decision-making. In two experiments we investigated if and how these two seemingly independent phenomena are related. We employed an orientation categorisation task that allowed us to concurrently quantify crowding and FCEs. Specifically, we examined whether the spatial arrangement of stimuli affects the FCE in a similar way as in crowding.</p><p>Interestingly, even when flankers were outside the crowding range, larger FCEs were observed for radially placed flankers compared to tangentially placed ones and for two compared to one flanker, corresponding to established patterns in crowding. However, inner flankers produced larger FCEs than outer flankers -the opposite of what is observed in crowding. In Experiment 2, we further investigated this reversed inner-outer asymmetry while manipulating the magnitude of crowding through varying target-flanker spacings. As expected, the outer flankers produced stronger crowding than inner ones. Crucially, the inner flankers produced a larger reaction time FCE and this inner-flanker interference was highest at the largest spacing. These findings demonstrate that the spatial layout of visual stimuli modulates conflict at both visual and decision-making stages, but the opposite patterns of the inner-outer asymmetry in the two phenomena provide a clear demarcation between the processes underlying them.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>The visual environment is frequently cluttered. To successfully navigate and interact in it, irrelevant information needs to be filtered out from relevant. However, irrelevant, and potentially conflicting, nearby information ('flankers') often interferes with the processing of relevant information in the visual field. Such interference is thought to arise at both the visual processing and decision-making stages. Two phenomena associated with flanker interference at each of these processing stages are visual crowding <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bouma, 1970)</ref> and the flanker compatibility effect <ref type="bibr">(FCE)</ref> as demonstrated by the Eriksen flanker task <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Eriksen &amp; Eriksen, 1974)</ref>, respectively. While these phenomena have conceptual and experimental similarities, they have been studied independently. As a result, there is no overarching framework for understanding the combined consequences of flanker interference across the entire processing hierarchy, potentially limiting the applicability of lab findings to real-life settings where decisionmaking may be based on sub-optimal sensory information.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Crowding</head><p>Crowding is a breakdown of object recognition in clutter, i.e., an object that can be accurately identified in isolation becomes unrecognisable when flanked by other similar objects <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bouma, 1970;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Chakravarthi &amp; Cavanagh, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Pelli &amp; Tillman, 2008)</ref>. Crowding is thought to be a fundamental constraint on how much information we can utilise from peripheral vision <ref type="bibr">(Levi, 2008a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Pelli &amp; Tillman, 2008)</ref> and is thought to result from interference at the visual processing stage <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Greenwood et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Harrison &amp; Bex, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Parkes et al., 2001)</ref>. Some of the salient characteristics of crowding are that its strength increases with a) decreasing target-flanker distance (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Wolford &amp; Chambers, 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Pelli et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Toet &amp; Levi, 1992</ref>) and b) increasing eccentricity <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bouma, 1970;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Toet and Levi, 1992)</ref>. Flankers beyond a certain distance from the target no longer interfere with it. This distance is commonly termed as critical spacing <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Pelli &amp; Tillman, 2008)</ref>. Critical spacing is largely proportional to eccentricity and has been estimated to be roughly half the eccentricity of the target from fixation <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bouma, 1970)</ref>. This proportionality has been recognised in the literature as the Bouma Law <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Pelli and Tillman, 2008)</ref>. However, critical spacing is not constant: it is systematically affected by various manipulations and can be substantially larger or smaller than half the eccentricity under certain conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Soo et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Scolari et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr"></ref> for a review see <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Strasburger, 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Numerous accounts attempt to capture the mechanisms underlying visual crowding <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(Strasburger et al., 1991)</ref>. However, the main proposals associated with crowding are pooling, substitution and selective attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">(Tyler &amp; Likova, 2007)</ref>. Pooling theories posit that under crowded conditions target and flanker features are averaged <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Balas et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Keshvari &amp; Rosenholtz, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Parkes et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Pelli et al., 2004)</ref>. Each visual area has neurons with receptive fields that increase in size with increasing eccentricity. Therefore, the further out in the periphery a stimulus is presented, the bigger on average, the receptive fields of the neurons responding to it <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Fang &amp; He, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Levi et al., 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Pelli, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr"></ref> for review see <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Strasburger et al., 2011)</ref>. When multiple stimuli fall within the same receptive field, their features are "pooled" resulting in crowding <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Dayan &amp; Solomon, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Motter &amp; Simoni, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Van Den Berg et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Wolford, 1975)</ref>. Crowding is stronger in the periphery than at fixation, as targets and flankers need to be much farther apart in order not to fall within the same receptive field <ref type="bibr">(Freeman &amp; Simoncelli, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr"></ref> however see <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Wallis et al., 2019)</ref>. In contrast, substitution theories argue that crowding results from mistaking the location of a target or its features and reporting a flanker instead <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Chastain, 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Estes et al., 1976;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Ester et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Strasburger, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Strasburger et al., 1991)</ref>. Evidence for substitution is apparent when examining the types of errors participants make, where participants often report the identity of a flanker instead of the target <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Freeman et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Ester et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Hanus &amp; Vul, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Harrison &amp; Bex, 2015)</ref>. The last account is selective attention. Selective attention serves to focus processing resources on relevant stimuli and attenuate the influence of irrelevant stimuli. It is thought to play a role in crowding, either as the source of the processing bottleneck <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(He et al., 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Chakravarthi &amp; Cavanagh, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr">2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Põder, 2007)</ref> or as a modulating influence <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Huckauf &amp; Heller, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Scolari et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Strasburger, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Strasburger &amp; Malania, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Yeshurun &amp; Rashal, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Kewan-Khalayly et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Mareschal et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">LaBerge et al., 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Bowen et al., 2023)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Eriksen Flanker Task</head><p>The Eriksen flanker task <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Eriksen &amp; Eriksen, 1974</ref>) is a conflict task in which a target stimulus and nearby flankers may evoke the same or opposing behavioural responses. The Stroop task <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">(Stroop, 1935)</ref>, Simon task <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Simon &amp; Rudell, 1967</ref>) and Navon's hierarchical letters <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Navon, 1977)</ref> are other prominent examples of conflict tasks. A common aspect of these is the occurrence of longer reaction times when task-irrelevant information is associated with an incompatible response (incongruent) than when it invokes a compatible response (congruent) or is neutral. The difference in reaction times between congruent and incongruent trials in the Eriksen flanker task is known as the flanker compatibility effect <ref type="bibr">(FCE)</ref> where the bigger the FCE, the stronger the interference induced by the flankers on the target (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Miller, 1991)</ref>. The Eriksen flanker task has been adapted in a large number of experimental settings to study a range of topics such as conflict monitoring <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Gratton et al., 1988)</ref>, creative intelligence during problem-solving (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Rowe et al., 2007)</ref>, executive control <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Davelaar &amp; Stevens, 2009)</ref>, the breadth of attentional selection <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Rowe et al., 2007)</ref> and ageing <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Reuter-Lorenz &amp; Cappell, 2008)</ref>. In contrast to crowding, in the Eriksen flanker task, the identity of both target and flankers can be accurately identified. Since the identities of the target and flankers have been processed and the conflict results from the congruency (or its lack) between them, this conflict has been interpreted to occur during the decision-making stage <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Eriksen &amp; Eriksen, 1974)</ref>. Even though most of the tested perceptual properties do not modulate the FCE <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Miller, 1991)</ref>, certain stimulus properties such as target-flanker spacing and colour similarity seem to do so <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Baylis &amp; Driver, 1992</ref>; however see: <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Harms &amp; Bundesen, 1983)</ref>. Therefore, the visual processing stage might play a more important role in the FCE than originally considered <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Eriksen &amp; Schultz, 1979)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The relationship between crowding and the FCE</head><p>Crowding and the FCE in the Eriksen flanker task have been treated and examined separately in the literature. However, when comparing them, it is clear that they share several characteristics. Even though they are used in different contexts, both examine how irrelevant information interferes with relevant information in our visual field and have employed comparable experimental approaches. Additionally, both fields of research have tested the role of target-flanker spacing. In both crowding (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bouma, 1970;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Pelli et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Toet &amp; Levi, 1992</ref>; for reviews see <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Levi, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Whitney &amp; Levi, 2011)</ref>, and the FCE in the Eriksen flanker task <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Eriksen &amp; Eriksen, 1974;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Kelber et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Kramer &amp; Jacobson, 1991)</ref>, interference is stronger at closer than farther target-flanker spacings.</p><p>Moreover, both phenomena appear to be modulated by target-flanker similarity, where interference is stronger between more similar objects (Crowding: <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Kooi et al., 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Chakravarthi &amp; Cavanagh, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Kennedy &amp; Whitaker, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Scolari et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr">FCE: Eriksen &amp; Schultz, 1979;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Baylis &amp; Driver, 1992)</ref>, although this relationship is well established in crowding, it is still debated in the FCE <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Harms &amp; Bundesen, 1983)</ref>. Nevertheless, the conditions under which the two phenomena have been studied also differ in some critical ways, suggesting that they might indeed have different boundary conditions where it is possible to observe only one or the other. Specifically, crowding has been predominantly studied in the visual periphery, using unspeeded identification responses and measured through identification accuracy (for a review see <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Whitney &amp; Levi, 2011)</ref>. In contrast, the FCE has been predominantly studied with stimuli presented at or close to fixation, using speeded categorisation responses measured with reaction times (for review see <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Ridderinkhof et al., 2021)</ref>. Consequently, a clear separating line is that the Eriksen flanker task typically involves situations where flankers are outside the critical spacing of crowding i.e., where object identification is unproblematic, whereas crowding typically investigates situations in which flankers are close enough to impair object identification. The identification of both targets and flankers is a necessary condition for the FCE as the effect results from the potential conflict between the responses evoked by the two. Thus, the FCE might be attenuated or absent when identification becomes difficult, as when stimuli are crowded. However, since the two phenomena are typically studied separately it is unclear whether this is the case.</p><p>As mentioned above, crowding is thought to be due to interference during visual processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Anderson et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Chen et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Chen et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Freeman et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Pelli, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Strasburger, 2020)</ref> whereas the FCE is due to conflict during decision-making <ref type="bibr">(Eriksen &amp; Eriksen;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Eriksen &amp; Schultz, 1979)</ref>. It is therefore likely that flanker interference in the two phenomena occurs sequentially, but their inter-dependence is currently unknown. Thus, it is not clear whether the specificities of visual processing leave any imprint on the later response selection stage when visual identification itself is unproblematic (e.g., no crowding). If the two types of flanker interference are linked, then stimulus manipulations that affect crowding should also affect the FCE. If this were the case, investigations of one phenomenon might be highly informative for the other, and much could be gained from integrating knowledge across both.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The current study</head><p>To examine the relationship between crowding and the FCE in the Eriksen flanker task, we studied the effect of spatial configuration of targets and flankers, as aspects of this are known to affect both phenomena. Importantly, certain spatial effects have been argued to be unique to crowding and thus to be diagnostic in distinguishing it from other related phenomena (for a review see <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Strasburger, 2020)</ref>. For example, flanker interference in crowding depends not only on the targetflanker distance but also on the position of the flankers relative to the target. First, there is a radial-tangential anisotropy in peripheral vision for crowding <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">(Toet &amp; Levi, 1992)</ref>: radially presented flankers induce more crowding than tangential ones (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Greenwood et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Kurzawski et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Kwon et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Petrov &amp; Meleshkevich, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Toet &amp; Levi, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Van Den Berg et al., 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">, Wolford &amp; Chambers, 1983)</ref>. A second key property, which is considered to be a diagnostic criterion of crowding, is the inner-outer asymmetry <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Banks et al., 1979;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Chakravarthi et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Petrov et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Shechter &amp; Yashar, 2021</ref>; for a review see <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Strasburger, 2020)</ref>. In particular, flankers that are presented between the target and fixation (inner) induce less crowding than flankers presented further away from fixation than the target (outer). It has also been noted that crowding is stronger with two flankers compared to one <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bouma, 1970;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Pelli et al., 2004)</ref>.</p><p>In Experiment 1, we examined whether the FCE in a modified Eriksen flanker task also demonstrates (1) the inner-outer asymmetry, (2) the radial-tangential anisotropy, and (3) if two flankers interfere more than one. To ensure that these asymmetries and anisotropies were not simply due to crowding, crowding was eliminated by placing the flankers well outside the critical spacing. This allowed us to test whether the spatial organisation of the scene continues to interfere with decision-making, even when the targets (and flankers) are accurately identified. If the FCE results exclusively from response conflict, the visual organisation of the scene should not influence the magnitude of the effect, as long as both the targets and flankers are adequately identifiable. Therefore, we would not expect to see any anisotropies or asymmetries in the FCE. However, if asymmetries follow the pattern seen in crowding, we would expect more flanker interference from 1) outer compared to inner, 2) radial compared to tangential and 3) two compared to one flanker. This would suggest that the specifics of visual processing influence the FCE even when stimulus identification is unproblematic. In Experiment 2, we further examined the inner-outer asymmetry and tested it across multiple target-flanker spacings. Since the inner-outer asymmetry has been used as a diagnostic tool for crowding, we wanted to test this asymmetry in the FCE both with and without crowding. This manipulation not only allowed us to examine the two under the same experimental settings but also provided insight into situations where decision-making is based on sub-optimal visual information.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment 1 Method</head><p>Participants Experiment 1 tested eighteen volunteer participants (self-reported: 4 males; 2 left-handed; mean age = 26.8 years; age range = 23-39). All participants reported having normal or corrected-to-normal visual acuity.</p><p>Participants were reimbursed £8 for their time.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample size calculation</head><p>We computed the required sample size based on previously reported effect sizes for three distinct effects: the 1) flanker compatibility effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Barzykowski et al., 2022)</ref>, 2) radial tangential anisotropy <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Kurzawski et al., 2023)</ref> in crowding, and 3) inner-outer asymmetry <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Chakravarthi et al., 2021)</ref> in crowding. We desired the sample size that would yield a power of at least 95% to detect the smallest of these effects. Specifically, for the FCE, the mean difference in RT between correct congruent and incongruent trials (n=466, mean=-44.2 ms, SD=23.9 ms; <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Barzykowski et al., 2022)</ref> has a standardised effect size ('delta', a standardised effect size in the Cohen's d family in which the standard deviation of the difference between conditions is used as the denominator) of 1.85, and hence n=7 yields a power of 95% to detect the FCE. For the radial-tangential anisotropy, the mean difference between radial and tangential critical spacing at 5 degrees eccentricity (n=50, mean= 0.65, SD=0.21; <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Kurzawski et al., 2023)</ref> gives a delta effect size of 3.1; therefore, n=4 will provide a power of 95% to detect the anisotropy. For the inner-outer asymmetry, the mean difference between in and out critical spacing at 7.5 degrees eccentricity (n= 38, mean=1.35, SD = 0.72; <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Chakravarthi et al., 2021)</ref> gives a 'delta' effect size of 1.87 where n=6 yields power of 95%. Previous studies have typically used participant numbers in the range of 4-12. Here, we sought to determine if there would be any spatial asymmetries. Hence, to ensure that we were adequately powered, we chose to triple the number of participants suggested by the power analysis, and hence we tested at least 18 individuals. These calculations were done using the power calculator provided by Gregory Francis (<ref type="url" target="http://www1.psych.purdue.edu/~gfrancis/calculators/means_dependent_power.shtml">http://www1.psych.purdue.edu/~gfrancis/calculators/means_dependent_   power.shtml</ref>).</p></div>

The target and flanker stimuli were clock-like objects: a circle with an oval hand along the radius. The thickness of the widest point of the hand was equal to the thickness of the circle. A target clock with a diameter of 1.5° of visual angle (dva) was presented at an eccentricity of 4° on the horizontal meridian to the left or the right of the fixation cross. Two stimulus groups ('up' and 'down') were created based on the orientation of the clock hand (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1C</ref>). Each stimulus group had three orientations: up (45°, 90°, 135°) and down (225°, 270°, 315°) 1 .

Categorisation accuracy and median reaction times, averaged over participants, as well as the difference between congruent and incongruent conditions for both measures, at all flanker positions, are plotted in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref>. In Experiment 1, we examined: (1) the inner-outer asymmetry, (2) the radial-tangential anisotropy and (3) interference from two compared to one flanker, in the FCE, as tested by the Eriksen flanker task. To evaluate the inner-outer asymmetry we computed a two-way repeated measures ANOVA with factors congruency (congruent, incongruent) and flanker position (inner, outer) for accuracy and s. As expected, accuracy was higher in congruent than in incongruent trials (F(1,17) = 34.11, p &lt; 0.001, = 0.67) and interestingly it was higher with the outer than with the inner flanker (F(1,17) = 7.56, p = 0.01, = 0.31). However, there was no significant interaction between the two factors (F(1,17) = 3.03, p = 0.10, = 0.15). Therefore, in terms of accuracy, there was no significant innerouter asymmetry for the FCE. However, it should be noted that accuracy was, as aimed for, near ceiling (Figure 2A, first panel), and thus the sensitivity to detect such an interaction, if it were there, would have been limited. Reaction times were also faster in congruent than in incongruent trials (F(1,17) = 99.86, p &lt; 0.001, = 0.85) and with outer than with inner flanker (F(1,17) = 20.21, p &lt; 0.001, = 0.54). However, here a two-way interaction between the factors showed that the FCE was stronger for the inner than for the outer flanker (F(1,17) = 5.02, p = 0.04, = 0.23) (see Figure 2D, first panel).</p><p>That is, (a) there was an inner-outer asymmetry for the FCE, observed in reaction times, even when there was no crowding and (b) surprisingly, this asymmetry was in the opposite direction to the one we would expect from crowding.

These findings were in line with what we would expect from crowding experiments.</p><p>Single flankers above or below the target induced slower reaction times when they were incongruent compared to congruent (F(1,17) = 6.05, p = 0.02, = 0.26). Reaction times did not differ depending on whether flankers were above or below the target and there was no interaction (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2D</ref>, last panel). Accuracy showed neither main effects nor interactions for this manipulation. For the full set of comparisons please see (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1C</ref>). In Experiment 1 we examined whether the spatial layout of targets and flankers affects FCEs in the same or similar way as the well-established counterparts in crowding. We tested conditions in which accuracy was well above 90% to ensure that any observed effects were not due to crowding.</p><p>Radial flankers produced a larger FCE than tangential flankers and two flankers produced a larger FCE than one flanker. These effects are consistent with corresponding effects in crowding <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">(Toet &amp; Levi, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Pelli et al., 2004)</ref>. We also observed an inner-outer asymmetry for the FCE, with inner flankers producing a larger FCE than outer flankers, which is the opposite pattern to that commonly observed in crowding <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Chakravarthi et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Petrov et al., 2007)</ref>. In conclusion, we found that spatial organisation of the flankers does modulate the FCE and that it had a specific pattern. There were some similarities between crowding and the FCE, but there was also one major difference, which signifies a clear demarcation between the two phenomena and possible underlying mechanisms.</p><p>Experiment 2</p><p>Crowding exhibits an inner-outer asymmetry where flanker interference by the outer flanker is stronger compared to that by the inner flanker.</p><p>Even though in Experiment 1 we did find an inner-outer asymmetry for the FCE in the Eriksen task, the direction of that asymmetry was the opposite of the one typically reported in crowding experiments (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Chakravarthi et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Petrov, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Shechter &amp; Yashar, 2021)</ref>.

The same ethics criteria and reimbursement as in Experiment 1 were implemented.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Stimuli and Procedure</head><p>The design of Experiment 2 was identical to that of the previous experiment except for a few differences: 1) we manipulated centre to centre target-flanker spacing (1.3°, 2°. 2.7°), 2) we tested only two flanker locations (inner, outer), 3) the target and flanker stimuli had the same size (1° of visual angle), and 4) we adjusted stimulus duration individually for participants to equate the overall level of accuracy.</p><p>Prior to the main experiment, participants underwent a staircase procedure in which stimulus duration was adjusted to ensure the selected spacings corresponded to points close to the critical spacing. This leverages the finding that critical spacing for crowding is modulated by stimulus duration, with longer exposure leading to a smaller zone of interference <ref type="bibr">(Tripathy and Cavanagh, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr">Tripathy et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Soo et al., 2018)</ref>. We used an adaptive staircase driven by the QUEST algorithm <ref type="bibr">(Watson &amp; Pelli, 1983)</ref>  During the main experiment, display duration was re-evaluated after each block and if accuracy was below 80% display duration was increased by one frame (8.3 ms) and if it was above 90% it decreased by one frame.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Accuracy and reaction times across spacings and the corresponding FCEs are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">3</ref>. We computed a three-way repeated measures ANOVA with factors congruency (congruent, incongruent), flanker position (inner, outer), and target-flanker spacing (1.3°, 2°, 2.7°) for accuracy and reaction times.</p><p>Greenhouse-Geisser (GG) correction was applied for the factor spacing and its interactions due to the multiple levels of the factor. As expected, accuracy was higher in congruent trials compared to incongruent (F(1,21) = 112.59, p &lt; 0.001, = 0.84) (see solid lines compared to dashed lines in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">3A</ref>), in the presence of inner compared to outer flankers (F(1,21) = 14.63, p &lt; 0.001, = 0.41) (see blue lines compared to green lines in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">3A</ref>) and when target-flanker spacing increased (F <ref type="bibr">(1.48, 31</ref>.01) = 43.84, p &lt; 0.001, = 0.68). Accuracy was near ceiling in congruent trials, and thus effects of flanker position and target-flanker spacing were mainly observed in incongruent trials (see two-way interactions with congruency in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>). Accuracy dropped faster when outer flankers were closer to the target (interaction flanker position x target-flanker spacing F <ref type="bibr">(1.82, 38.16</ref>) = 20.39, p &lt; 0.001, = 0.49), but this was the case only in incongruent trials (three-way interaction: F(1.33, 27.93) = 29.96, p &lt; 0.001, = 0.59). This drop in accuracy at closer target-flanker distances, which is more pronounced for the outer flanker, is the typical pattern observed in crowding. The fact that this was only observed for incongruent trials (and that it therefore shows up as an interaction with congruency in the analysis) is most likely because pooling or substitution was likely to yield a percept associated with the incorrect response only with incongruent, but not congruent, flankers: in congruent trials, the "clock hands" of target and flankers all point in the same overall direction, but in incongruent trials this is not the case).</p><p>Reaction times were also faster in congruent compared to incongruent trials (F(1,21) = 21.09, p &lt; 0.001, = 0.50) (see solid lines compared to dashed in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">3B</ref>). Surprisingly, they were also faster in trials with outer compared to inner flankers (F(1,21) = 23.34, p &lt; 0.001, = 0.52) (see green lines compared to blue in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">3B</ref>). The FCE was stronger in the presence of inner compared to outer flankers (interaction congruency x flanker position: F(1,21) = 14.21, p &lt; 0.001, = 0.40). Increasing spacing had opposite effects on reaction time FCE with inner and outer flankers (interaction congruency x flanker position x spacing: F(1.92, 40.39) = 3.33, p =0.007, = 0.23): in the presence of outer flankers, increasing spacing reduced the reaction time FCE whereas it increased for inner flankers (see blue line compared to green in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">3D</ref>). This unexpected pattern seems easier to comprehend when considering the data in terms of flanker eccentricity (i.e., the largest spacing for the inner flanker corresponds to the smallest flanker eccentricity and the largest spacing for the outer flanker to the largest eccentricity), as opposed to target-flanker spacing:</p><p>the larger the flanker eccentricity, the smaller the FCE (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">3D</ref>). For the full set of comparisons see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>.</p><p>In summary, our data confirmed that we successfully manipulated crowding: accuracy decreased with decreasing target-flanker spacing.</p><p>This effect was more pronounced for outer flankers, reflecting the established inner-outer asymmetry in crowding. We also confirmed the unexpected finding of Experiment 1, that the inner-outer asymmetry is reversed for the congruency effect in terms of reaction times, with inner flankers producing stronger interference. Finally, Experiment 2 revealed a new, unexpected effect in the form of an interaction: target-flanker spacing had opposite effects on reaction time FCE for inner and outer flankers:</p><p>whereas smaller spacings led to larger reaction time FCE for outer flankers, it led to smaller reaction time FCE for inner flankers. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Discussion</head><p>We examined the differences and similarities between crowding and the Flanker Compatibility Effect (FCE) in the Eriksen flanker task over two experiments where the spatial arrangement of flankers was manipulated.</p><p>In line with established effects in crowding, larger reaction time FCEs were found for radial compared to tangential flankers and for two compared to one flanker. These observations were made under conditions without crowding and thus do not simply signify a downstream effect of difficulties in object recognition. In sharp contrast, inner flankers produced a larger reaction time FCE than outer flankers, a pattern opposite to that commonly observed in crowding <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Chakravarthi et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Petrov et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Shechter &amp; Yashar, 2021)</ref>. Interestingly, this pattern persisted even when flankers were moved close enough to cause crowding, although the difference in reaction time FCEs between inner and outer flankers was reduced under such conditions. Even more surprisingly, the reaction time FCE decreased when the inner flanker was closer to the target; that is, it produced less, not more, interference. This is the opposite of what was observed for the outer flanker. It is also contrary to what has been previously reported for both crowding <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">(Wolford &amp; Chambers, 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Pelli et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Toet &amp; Levi, 1992)</ref> and the Eriksen flanker task <ref type="bibr">(Eriksen &amp; Eriksen, 1975</ref>). As will be discussed later, this unexpected finding can possibly be explained by flanker eccentricity, rather than target-flanker spacing, being the more relevant factor here. In summary, our findings show similarities, and also pronounced differences, in the effects of the spatial layout of the stimuli on flanker interference in crowding and the Eriksen flanker task. Although it is possible to observe both phenomena under the same conditions, these differences present a clear demarcation between them.</p><p>Our results from Experiment 2 show that substantial flanker interference both in the form of crowding and FCEs can occur concurrently, as seen at the closest target-flanker spacing. That both phenomena can be observed together was not clear a priori: the Eriksen flanker task is commonly conducted under conditions without crowding and crowding studies typically neither manipulate flanker compatibility nor report reaction times, thus providing no information on FCEs. One could argue that crowding should attenuate the FCE, since it degrades target identification at the very least, and the FCE depends on targets and flankers being identified and categorised to opposite responses. Instead, both effects seemed to be largely independent here, as the conditions with the strongest crowding did not show an overall different level of FCE.</p><p>The radial-tangential anisotropy found in the FCE was in line with the anisotropy found in crowding (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Greenwood et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Toet &amp; Levi, 1992)</ref>. Interestingly, the radial-tangential anisotropy is present in other visual phenomena such as surround suppression <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Petrov &amp; McKee, 2006)</ref> and redundancy masking <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">(Yildirim et al., 2020</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">(Yildirim et al., ,2021))</ref>. This asymmetry therefore might be a more general property of peripheral processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Greenwood et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Nandy &amp; Tjan, 2012</ref>). An alternative explanation is that it is easier to process stimuli along the horizontal meridian compared to other locations <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Abrams et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Carrasco et al., 2001</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Carrasco et al., , 2002</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Carrasco et al., , 2004</ref>). In our stimulus set up, radial flankers were presented on the horizontal meridian, but tangential ones were not. Hence, the radial flankers might have been processed better than tangential ones leading to a stronger FCE. This horizontal advantage might be due to the visual system's inherent propensity for improved processing of a variety of stimuli in specific spatial locations (for a review see <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Yashar &amp; Carrasco, 2024)</ref> or might be reading related, which prioritises horizontal processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Martelli et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Pelli et al., 2007)</ref>.</p><p>An inner-outer asymmetry for the FCE was observed in our study but with stronger interference from the inner than the outer flanker, which was unexpected and contrary to that found in crowding. The presence of these two asymmetries, radial-tangential and inner-outer, provides evidence that flanker interference effects most likely arising in retinotopically organised visual cortex affect the FCE, even when there is no crowding. However, in contrast to radial-tangential anisotropy, the inner-outer asymmetry appears to be unique to crowding and indeed has been used as a diagnostic tool for crowding to distinguish it from other visual phenomena <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Pelli et al., 2004)</ref>. Taken together, the above findings suggest that the FCE may partially result from stimulus interactions in the visual cortex, but that this interference is distinct from that in crowding.</p><p>One of the few perceptual properties that has been known to modulate the FCE is the spacing between the target and its flankers: as the separation between them increases, the FCE decreases <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Eriksen &amp; Eriksen, 1974)</ref>. However, not many other perceptual factors seem to influence the phenomenon. <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Miller (1991)</ref> tested the role of target-flanker spacing, attentional focus, visual transients, and perceptual load and found that the FCE is only dependent on the target-flanker spacing. Additionally, conflicting findings have been reported on whether the FCE is affected by colour similarity <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Baylis &amp; Driver, 1992)</ref> or not <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Harms &amp; Bundesen, 1983)</ref> and grouping between target and nearby flankers, which have wellestablished effects on crowding <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Herzog &amp; Manassi, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Herzog et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Kooi et al., 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Rashal &amp; Yeshurun, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Scolari et al., 2007)</ref>.</p><p>Therefore, the extent to which conflict during decision-making is affected by perceptual manipulations in situations where identification is intact, remains unclear. Since not many perceptual manipulations affect the FCE, the radial-tangential anisotropy found in the current paper, is surprising. It is plausible that there is something distinctive regarding spatial properties, including target-flanker separation and spatial organisation, in the FCE that is not translatable to other visual properties. It could be that the spatial layout of targets and flankers affects the speed and strength of identification processes, which then modulates decision-making.</p><p>Another intriguing finding of our study was that, in Experiment 2, the FCE decreased with increasing spacing for the outer flanker but increased for the inner flanker. On the face of it, this finding seems inexplicable. By comparison, in crowding, pooling theories provide an explanation for the inner-outer asymmetry, where the outer flanker leads to more interference than the inner one. Each visual area has neurons with receptive fields that increase in size with increasing eccentricity.</p><p>Therefore, the further out in the periphery a stimulus is presented, the bigger on average are the receptive fields of the neurons responding to it <ref type="bibr">(Freeman &amp; Simoncelli, 2011)</ref>. Consequently, the outer flanker is more likely to fall within the same receptive field as the target compared to the inner one <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Chen et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Dayan &amp; Solomon, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Pelli &amp; Tillman, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Shechter &amp; Yashar, 2021</ref>; for review see: <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Rosenholtz et al., 2019)</ref>.</p><p>When stimuli fall within the same receptive field of a neuron, their features are "pooled" leading to crowding <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Dayan &amp; Solomon, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Motter &amp; Simoni, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Van Den Berg et al., 2010)</ref>, which explains the stronger crowding by the outer flanker than the inner one. Equivalently, the outer flanker is closer to the target in terms of cortical distance than the inner flanker and hence interferes more strongly <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Pelli, 2008)</ref>. Note that the substitution theory of crowding can potentially also explain this asymmetry by positing more spatial uncertainty for the outer, more peripheral, flanker than for the inner one. Increased spatial uncertainty leads to more confusion of features or whole objects leading to stronger crowding.</p><p>However, there is no consensus on whether there are more substitution errors for the inner or the outer flanker. Strasburger and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Strasburger, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Strasburger, 2020)</ref> show that even though the outer flanker might induce more crowding, more substitution errors are present for the inner flanker. That is, there seems to be more positional uncertainty for the inner flanker. These substitution errors for the inner flanker depend on eccentricity where the higher the eccentricity, the more substitution errors <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(Strasburger &amp; Malania, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Strasburger, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Strasburger, 2020)</ref>. However, more substitution errors have also been reported for the outer flanker compared to the inner as positional uncertainty is greater with increased eccentricity <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Shechter &amp; Yashar, 2021)</ref>.</p><p>Our findings have practical value for studies investigating cognitive control using the Eriksen flanker task: placing the flanker, rather than the target, at or near fixation increases the magnitude of the FCE. This can yield higher power to detect interactions of the FCE with other factors, as is commonly studied in performance Yildirim <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Debener et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Steinhauser &amp; Andersen, 2019)</ref> or conflict monitoring <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">(Yeung et al., 2004)</ref> experiments, where the FCE is modulated by errors or response conflict (incongruent stimuli) on preceding trials. However, unlike the present experiments, it may be desirable to allow participants to focus attention on target positions under such circumstances, as the effects of interest may depend on selective attention (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">McDermott et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Steinhauser &amp; Andersen, 2019)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>In conclusion, we studied interference from task-irrelevant visual stimuli ('flankers') through the Eriksen flanker task and visual crowding. In order to explore possible links between them, we examined whether wellestablished characteristics of crowding are also observable in the Eriksen flanker task. In line with crowding, we found that radial flankers induce stronger FCEs compared to tangential, and two flankers lead to stronger FCEs compared to one flanker. In contrast, we observed an inner-outer asymmetry where interference was stronger from the inner compared to the outer flanker, which is the opposite direction of the asymmetry observed in crowding. This highlights the differences in the mechanisms that lead to the two phenomena. We propose that changes in the strength of flanker representation due to its position in retinotopic space can account for its potency to induce a FCE. Consequently, unlike in crowding where outer flankers interfere most with visual processing, inner flankers drive stronger response selection conflicts. These findings show that the visuo-spatial configuration of objects affects downstream response conflict while also highlighting a clear demarcation between crowding and response compatibility effects.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>by decreasing the size of the flankers to two thirds that of the target (1° diameter). This allowed us to present flankers at a centre-to-centre distance of 2° from the target without inducing crowding. Note that, while we could have reduced crowding by instead moving flankers further away, it would have moved the inner flanker close to or on top of the fixation cross.Flankers were either from the same response group as the target (congruent) or from the other group (incongruent). Flankers were never identical to each other or to the target. Four flanker locations were used relative to the target (inner, outer, above, and below), which were combined with the manipulation of the number of flankers (one or two) to yield 6 flanker position conditions: three tangential (above, below, above &amp; below) and three radial(inner, outer, inner &amp; outer). To clearly indicate the target location and avoid ambiguity due to its changing relative location across flanker configurations, its position was indicated by four diagonal straight lines with a dot at the end (length 2°, thickness 0.15°).</figDesc></figure>

At the end of each trial, participants received auditory feedback in the form of a beep for error responses. At the end of each block, average accuracy and reaction times for that block were presented to participants.Participants proceeded to the next block after a self-paced break.Each participant completed 1176 trials across 7 blocks. There were 168 different types of trials: 2 presentation sides (left, right), 2 response groups (up, down), 3 target identities within each group, 2 flanker congruency (congruent, incongruent) types, and 7 flanker positions (above, below, above &amp; below, inner, outer, inner &amp; outer, no flanker).Each block included a single presentation of each type of trial and all trials in each block were shown in random order. For calculation of accuracy and median reaction time, we pooled responses across presentation side, response group and target identity. Accordingly, behavioural data were analysed in terms of flanker position and congruency with 84 trials per condition, except for the no-flanker condition, which was tested with 168 trials. For each condition, the median reaction time was calculated from correct trials (93.7% of all trials).Prior to the experiment, participants completed two sets of practice blocks. First, 72 trials with no flankers were presented to ensure participants became familiar with the response groups. A second practice block with 168 trials identical to a block from the main experiment including all experimental conditions was then completed. If participants scored less than 90% accuracy across all trials, this block was repeated. All participants were able to perform above 90% accuracy within a maximum of two blocks of practice.</figDesc></figure>

Accuracy and median reaction times averaged across participants as a function of flanker position with within-subjects 95% confidence intervals as error bars (Cousineau, 2005) (Morey, 2008). Plots A&amp;B show average performance where black filled circles represent performance in the congruent trials and grey open squares performance in the incongruent trials. The solid red line with the shaded area is performance in the no flanker condition. Plots C&amp;D show the difference in performance in the incongruent and congruent conditions (incongruent -congruent), for each flanker position. Here, more negative values for accuracy, and more positive values for reaction times represent stronger FCE. Zero represents no FCE which is indicated with a solid grey line. For the flanker positions coded as (1F), we pooled trials across single flanker presentations where inner and outer locations yield a 'Radial (1F)' condition and above and below locations yield a 'Tangential (1F)' condition.</figDesc><graphic coords="13,72.00,272.05,467.70,305.20" type="bitmap" /></figure>

Accuracy and reaction times for radial and tangential for one flanker were computed by averaging across inner and outer and above and below flanker positions, respectively. Accuracy was again higher in congruent compared to incongruent trials (F(1,17) = 17.81, p &lt; 0.001, = 0.51) and there was an interaction between congruency and flanker location where the FCE was stronger for radial compared to tangential flanker positions (F(1,17) = 11.23, p = 0.003, = 0.40) (see Figure 2A, middle panel). That is, a radial-tangential anisotropy was found in the same direction as seen in crowding. Reaction times were faster in congruent compared to incongruent trials (F(1,17) = 160.03, p &lt; 0.001, = 0.90) and with one compared to two flankers (F(1,17) = 67.27, p &lt; 0.001, = 0.80). A three-way interaction was found between congruency, flanker position, and number of flankers where the FCE, in terms of reaction times, was larger in the presence of radial flankers compared to tangential flankers, and this effect was even more pronounced when there were two flankers present compared to one (F(1,17) = 5.04, p = 0.04, = 0.23) (see Figure 2D, middle panel).

The estimate was computed with 80 trials, with the flanker configuration randomly drawn from the possible set of combinations excluding the no flanker condition. The maximum stimulus duration used was 200 ms to prevent eye movements. If QUEST indicated that a duration over 200 ms was required for a participant, then the staircase procedure was repeated. If this again yielded a display duration above 200 ms, the participant completed the main experiment at the maximum duration.</figDesc></figure>

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_7"><figDesc>However, this unexpected finding can be accounted for if we consider the changes to the representation of the flanker stimulus at various eccentricities as it changes with different target-flanker spacings. As the target-flanker spacing increases for the inner flanker, it moves closer to the fovea, resulting in a stronger neural representation due to cortical magnification. However, when the target-flanker spacing increases for the outer flanker, it moves further into the visual periphery, and hence its representation is weakened. If one assumes that the FCE results from a competition between target and flanker stimuli for response selection, then the observed changes in the magnitude of the FCE are consistent with the changes in the strength of the representation of the flanker stimulus as a function of its eccentricity. The same explanation could also account for the stronger FCE from two flankers and from radial than tangential flankers in experiment 1, as the former benefit from being placed along the horizontal meridian.</figDesc></figure>
