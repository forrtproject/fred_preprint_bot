<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>While a body of literature has addressed quantification of aversive conditioning, fewer studies have compared different conditioned response types during human reward learning and its retention after overnight consolidation. In consequence, it is unclear how to best quantify reward conditioning in humans. Here, we sought to fill this gap by investigating heart period response (HPR), skin conductance response (SCR), pupil size (PSR), and respiration amplitude response (RAR) during Pavlovian reward conditioning with a primary reinforcer. We conducted two independent experiments (N 1 = 37, N 2 = 34) with a learning phase and a recall phase 7 days later. A visual conditioned stimulus (CS+) predicted fruit juice reward (unconditioned stimulus, US), while a second CS-predicted US absence. In experiment 1, model-based analysis of HPR distinguished CS+/CS-, both during learning (Hedge's g = 0.56) and recall (g = 0.40). Furthermore, model-based analysis of PSR distinguished CS+/CS-in early trials during recall (g = 0.69). As an out-of-sample generalisation test, experiment 2 confirmed the result for HPR during learning (g = 0.78) and recall (g = 0.55), as well as for PSR during recall (g = .41). We conclude that in our Pavlovian reward conditioning paradigm, HPR is a robust measure of reward learning, while both HPR and PSR robustly index the retention of reward memory.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Learning to predict reward events plays an important role for many biological organisms. A quintessential paradigm to study this in the laboratory is Pavlovian reward conditioning <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Martin-Soelch et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Pavlov, 1927)</ref>. Here, an initially neutral stimulus (conditioned stimulus, CS) is repeatedly paired with a naturally appetitive stimulus (unconditioned stimulus, US, e.g., primary vs. secondary reinforcers), and comes to elicit some behavioral or physiological responses (conditioned response, CR). In turn, this CR is taken to indicate learning the association, and when it is elicited after a delay, it is taken as indicative of reward memory. In human conditioning research, including reward and aversive conditioning <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Lonsdorf et al., 2017)</ref>, learning is usually indexed by the difference between responses elicited by CS+ with those elicited by a CS-, which predicts the absence of the US, in a paradigm known as differential learning.</p><p>Several psychophysiological CRs have been suggested to reflect human reward learning. Specifically, quantification of human reward conditioning has been based on skin conductance responses (SCR) <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Exner et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Klucken et al., 2019)</ref>, cardiac responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Ebrahimi et al., 2019</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Ebrahimi et al., , 2019;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Hermann et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr">Pietrock et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Sayão et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Wardle et al., 2018)</ref>, startle-eyeblink <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Andreatta &amp; Pauli, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Hermann et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Stussi et al., 2018)</ref>, postauricular reflex <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Ebrahimi et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Pietrock et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Stussi et al., 2018)</ref>, and pupil dilation <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Bray et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Pietrock et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Pool et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Prévost et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Reinhard &amp; Lachnit, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Schad et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Seymour et al., 2007)</ref>. Notably, however, evidence for CS+/CS-differences in these observables is inconsistent between studies; but experimental protocols are also heterogenous and differ by the type of paradigm (delay or trace conditioning), the type of CS and US, including primary and secondary reinforcers, CS-US intervals, and reinforcement schedule <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Exner et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">O'Doherty et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Wardle et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Consequently, interpretation of diverging results is difficult, which raises the question of what constitutes the most sensitive measure(s) to capture reward learning. Some previous work has directly compared different CRs, again with heterogeneous results. One study reported similarly small effect sizes in corrugator EMG, zygomaticus EMG, and SCR <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Wardle et al., 2018)</ref>; another one showed a large effect in HPR and smaller effects in pupil dilation, gaze patterns, with no effect in SCR or startle eyeblink <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Pietrock et al., 2019)</ref>; and a third one a larger effect in SCR than in startle eyeblink <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Andreatta &amp; Pauli, 2019)</ref>.</p><p>Furthermore, it is unclear whether any of these results would generalise to the assessment of memory retention after overnight consolidation. This question is relevant in the context of pharmacological and non-invasive intervention studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Ojala et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Wehrli et al., 2023</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Wehrli et al., , 2024;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Xia et al., 2024)</ref>. It also holds significant importance for pre-clinical studies in the context of experimental psychopathology. Here, reward learning is often taken as a model of addiction symptoms, such as cue-induced drug craving <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Keiflin &amp; Janak, 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Thus, the present work aimed to identify the most sensitive psychophysiological CR to quantify reward learning and retention after overnight consolidation. We employed a Pavlovian reward conditioning paradigm with primary reinforcer, in which participants gradually learned CS-US contingencies, and retention was tested after seven days. Our outcome variables were based on four observables: skin conductance response (SCR), pupil size responses (PSR), heart period response (HPR), and respiratory amplitude response (RAR).</p><p>To determine the most sensitive CR, we used a calibration approach. Put simply, this assumes a priori that participants do acquire a CS-US association, and evaluates different putative CR by their ability to reproduce this learning, as indexed by retrodictive validity <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bach, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr">Bach et al., 2020)</ref>. In our case, retrodictive validity can be expressed as the effect size to distinguish CS+/CS-. To protect ourselves against overfitting to peculiarities of small samples, we employed an exploration-confirmation approach as in previous work on these observables <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Castegnetti et al., 2016</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Castegnetti et al., , 2017;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Korn et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Xia et al., 2022)</ref>. Specifically, in experiment 1 we explored different CR indices derived from all four psychophysiological observables (i.e., HPR, SCR, PSR, and RAR) in their sensitivity to distinguish CS+/CS-. We retained all indices that yielded an effect size of Hedge's g &gt; 0.5, and confirmed them in experiment 2. This effect size was chosen a priori to be large enough to be usable in intervention studies, where the maximum achievable effect size is constrained by the effect size in the control group. In addition, we heuristically report smaller effect sizes in conjunction with significant p-values (without correction for multiple comparison).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Sample size and participants</head><p>Power analysis for experiments 1 and 2 were performed using G*Power 3.1.9.7 <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Faul et al., 2007)</ref>. We analysed a one-sided paired t-test, which is appropriate since our study design involves repeated measures on the same subjects under different conditions. In result, 34 participants were needed to achieve our a priori chosen effect size of Cohen's d &gt; 0.5 (which approximates Hedge's g) with 80%</p><p>power and an alpha level at 0.05. We recruited 37 participants in experiment 1 to allow for drop-outs due to early termination and data exclusion. For experiment 2, power analysis showed that 32 participants were needed based on the HPR effect size reported in experiment 1 with 80% power. We recruited 34 participants in experiment 2 to allow for drop-out.</p><p>Healthy participants were recruited from the student and general population in Zurich. The governmental ethics committee approved the study <ref type="bibr">(KEK-ZH-2013-0118)</ref>. All participants provided informed consensus using a form approved by the ethics committee, and received monetary compensation based on experiment duration. See Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> for details of demographics and general information. presentation of delicious food and drink images. After the video, they reported their food-and drink-fasting duration (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>) and rated their hunger and thirst levels on a visual analogue scale (VAS) with endpoints 0-100. They chose their favorite flavor among apple, orange, mango, and multivitamin juices, and then rated all four juices on a VAS with endpoints 0-100, which was consistent with the categorical selection for all participants. The chosen favorite juice was then used as US in the subsequent Pavlovian reward conditioning task (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). This conditioning task was conducted in the morning between 8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m.</p><p>After conditioning, participants completed a computer-based questionnaire about awareness of CS-US contingency ("How likely were you to receive a sip of juice when looking at this triangle today", "How likely were you to receive a sip of juice when looking at this triangle last week?") as well as experienced arousal and valence to all CS. Seven days later, participants came back for a recall test after the same fasting procedure, and this recall test was conducted in the afternoon between 1:00 pm to 5:00 pm. They completed the state anxiety part of the STAI and watched the same priming video as describe earlier, followed by fasting time reporting and ratings for hunger and thirst. Subsequently, they completed the recall task with a follow-up computer-based questionnaire about CS-US contingency ('How likely were you to receive a sip of juice when looking at this triangle last week?') and ratings on arousal and valence to all CS conditions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.2.">Pavlovian reward conditioning task</head><p>All experiments were presented via MATLAB R2021a (The Math Works; <ref type="url" target="https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html">https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html</ref>) using the Cogent 2000 toolbox (<ref type="url" target="http://www.vislab.ucl.ac.uk/Cogent">http://www.vislab.ucl.ac.uk/Cogent</ref>). The reward conditioning task included two blocks, with 24 CS+ and 24 CS-trials per block, resulting in 96 trials in total. Trial order was randomized with the constraint that were no more than three trials with the same CS, or more than three US, in a row. In the learning phase, the CS+ was reinforced 50% of the time, whereas the CS-was never reinforced. The first CS+ trial in each block was always reinforced. In the recall task, both CS conditions were never reinforced. The instruction for the learning phase was "In this experiment, you will see differently colored triangles and receive a sip of juice now and then. You will notice that depending on the triangle you will receive a sip of juice more or less frequently"; the instruction for the recall phase was "Today the same triangles will be presented again". In both phases, no explicit CS-US contingency instructions were given to participants.</p><p>Each trial started with a 6-s CS presentation, followed by an inter-trial interval (ITI) during which a fixation cross was presented. ITI duration was a random integer between 9-16 s. In reinforced CS+ trials, a sip of fruit juice was automatically delivered into participants' mouth 5 s after CS+ onset. To avoid artifacts in the psychophysiological recordings, participants were tasked to keep the juice in their mouth and swallow during the ITI when signaled. This signal appeared at random between 2-5 s after CS offset for 2 s. In order to keep the participants attentive during the task, they were asked to press a specific key associated with each CS. If participants did not respond, or pressed the incorrect key, error feedback was given during the first 2 s of the ITI. (US). The reinforcement rate was 50% and another colored triangle was never reinforced (CS-). In each trial, participants had to press the right or left arrow key to indicate the presented CS. Participants were informed about wrong or no key</p><p>presses during the first 2 s of the inter-trial interval (ITI). The signal to swallow was presented at a random time between 2 -5 s after CS offset for 2 s. The duration of the ITI was randomly sampled between 9 -16 s.

For each participant, we used and recorded the lead configuration that yielded the clearest R spikes (ECG100C, Biopac Systems Inc.). To record skin conductance, two 8-mm disk Ag/AgCl cup electrodes (EL258, Biopac, Goleta, CA) filled with 0.5% NaCl gel <ref type="bibr">(GEL101, Biopac;</ref><ref type="bibr">Hygge &amp; Hugdahl, 1985)</ref> were applied to the thenar and hypothenar eminence of the non-dominant hand and connected to a constant voltage coupler/amplifier (EDA100C, Biopac).

The amplitudes of the input into this system are assumed to reflect the psychological latent variable, which in the context of associative learning is the CS-US association.</p><p>Given a psychophysiological model, the latent variable can be estimated from physiological data by means of model inversion <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bach et al., 2018)</ref>. Similar to previous work on these observables <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bach, Flandin, et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Castegnetti et al., 2016</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Castegnetti et al., , 2017;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Korn et al., 2017)</ref>, we constructed our psychophysiological models as linear time invariant systems (LTI), which are fully defined by their response functions (RF). Two approaches are often used to construct the RF for an LTI. On the one hand, one may formalize the RF from identified biophysical relations between inputs and outputs. This approach assumes that researchers already understand the underlying <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Friston et al., 2000)</ref>. On the other hand, one may construct a phenomenological RF from the empirical data, even if the underlying biophysical systems are unknown <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Castegnetti et al., 2016)</ref>. In the present work, we employed the second approach. For SCR, the existing phenomenological model is split into an invariant peripheral system that does not depend on experimental paradigm, and a flexible model of the neural input, which can be estimated from data. The peripheral model has been validated by direct intraneural recordings <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Gerster et al., 2018)</ref>, such that there was no need to develop a new RF for SCR.</p><p>On the other hand, existing RF for HPR, PSR, and RAR collapse paradigm-specific central processes and the peripheral system, such that they are not necessarily applicable to the current experimental paradigm. Thus, we used data from experiment 1 to develop RF for these modalities.</p><p>Once the shape of the RF is defined, the next step is to estimate the system's input to best explain data. To obtain input amplitude estimates, we inverted general linear convolution models (GLM) to fit the predicted timeseries (obtained through the convolution of the RF with a constant input shape) to the empirical data timeseries <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bach et al., 2018)</ref>. The GLMs are either trial-wise or condition-wise, depending on the modality of the data. Trial-wise GLMs were used for PSR, which have a time course that does not overlap between trials <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Korn et al., 2017)</ref>, whereas condition-wise GLMs were used for HPR and RAR.

We developed and tested several RF (Table <ref type="table">2</ref>). For all models, pupil diameter time series for each participant and each block were z-scored. Then, the first 3 (models 3, 4, and 5), 3.5 (models 2 and 6) or 15 (model 1) s of each trial were extracted, and each timepoint averaged first within condition, then over all participants. In line with previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Korn et al., 2017)</ref>, we fitted the difference between the mean over all CS+ and the mean over all CS-trials. To avoid contamination of the PSR by overlapping US responses, we only considered CS+ trials that were not reinforced by a US for RF1 that extended beyond the CS-US interval. For RF2-6, we used all trials. At the request of an anonymous reviewer, we compared this approach to standard peak-scoring analysis. Specifically, we first extracted the preprocessed pupil size within each trial from CS onset to US onset, which spans a duration of 5 seconds. Next, we subtracted the baseline value from the pupil data. The baseline is defined as the mean pupil size, excluding any missing values, during the 1-second period preceding each CS onset. From this baseline-corrected pupil data we took the maximum value as the peak-scored pupil dilation of a trial.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Experiment 1</head><p>Grand means for the intra-trial time course, as well as the two relevant RF, are shown in figure 2. In the learning phase, the condition difference between CS+ and CS-exceeded our a priori effect-size threshold (Hedge's g &gt; 0.5) for the HPR index only (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">3</ref>, figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>). For PSR, indices from RF4 and RF5 were close to the threshold with g-values around 0.4, while there was no apparent CS+/CSdifference for SCR and RAR (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">3</ref>). Notably, this analysis is biased for HPR, PSR and RAR because it is based on RF fitted to the same data sets. Finally, there was no CS+/CS-difference in peak-scoring analysis of PSR. Analysis of trial-by-trial responses revealed no subsets of trials that exceeded the threshold in any PSR metric or SCR, and there were no additional insights from analysing first and second half of the learning phase for HPR and SCR.</p><p>For the recall phase, we found an above-threshold condition difference between CS+ and CS-for HPR (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">3</ref>, figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>). Because the RF was fit on data from the learning phase only, this was an unbiased analysis and therefore suggests that participants indeed retained reward memory. When averaging over all trials, there were no CS+/CS-differences in any other metric. However, trial-by-trial analysis of PSR revealed large effects in the first part of the recall phase. The largest effect size was achieved by PSR RF5 for the first 7 CS+ and CS-trials (g = 0.68) (figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>). In SCR, effect sizes up to around g = 0.35 were observed in the first 3-4 CS+ and CS-trials. See supplementary material for trial-by-trial results for all metrics from the recall phase.   Figure 3.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p>Pavlovian reward conditioning is an important basic learning paradigm but its optimal quantification in humans remains unclear, in particular for recall after overnight consolidation. Here, we pitched different CR against each other in the same experimental paradigm. We used a rigorous exploration-confirmation approach to establish the best psychophysiological indices for measuring reward learning and memory retention over seven days. Our key finding is that among candidate psychophysiological indices (based on HPR, SCR, PSR, and RAR), modelbased HPR analysis distinguished CS+/CS-in the learning phase across both experiments, with Hedge's g = 0.56 in experiment 1 and g = 0.78 in experiment 2.</p><p>It also distinguished CS+/CS-in the recall test after 7 days, with g = 0.40 in experiment 1 and g = 0.55 in experiment 2. Furthermore, model-based PSR analysis distinguished CS+/CS-in the recall phase with largest effect size when averaging over 7 trials in experiment 1 (g = 0.69) and experiment 2 (g = 0.41).</p><p>Thus, HPR and PSR as analysed with our new response functions appear to be replicable measures of classical reward conditioning and memory retention over 7 days.</p><p>4.1.1. HPR discriminated CS+/CS-difference in learning and recall HPR has been examined in previous reward conditioning work, however with conflicting results. Our present observation of reward-conditioned bradycardia replicates a previous study <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Pietrock et al. 2019)</ref>. This work employed a highly similar Pavlovian reward conditioning paradigm, and analyzed HPR using PsPM's general linear convolution model (GLM). In contrast, in other previous work, cardiac responses did not discriminate CS+/CS- <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Ebrahimi et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Exner et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Hermann et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Sayão et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Wardle et al., 2018)</ref>. There appear two main differences between these studies and ours. First, these studies used heart rate as the CR and/or analyzed HPR using different approaches (e.g., mean change, heart index, and mean level) <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Ebrahimi et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Sayão et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Wardle et al., 2018)</ref>. Compared to heart rate, HPR has been shown to linearly relate to neural input into the heart and is therefore more likely to linearly relate to psychological variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bach &amp; Melinscak, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Berntson et al., 1995)</ref>. Also, work on fear conditioning suggests that a model-based approach might be more sensitive to discriminate CS+/CS-differences based on HPR than peak-scoring analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Castegnetti et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Paulus et al., 2016)</ref>. Hence, the observed null results in these studies may be due to the selection of CR index. Second, in some studies using odor as the US, a conditioning effect was not only absent for the HPR, but also for any other psychophysiological measures <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Exner et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Hermann et al., 2000)</ref>. A potential interpretation is that participants simply did not learn, possibly due to reduced associability of CS and odour <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Kokkola et al., 2019)</ref>.</p><p>Another interesting question is whether reward and fear conditioning affect HPR differently. Descriptively, the effect size for reward-conditioned HPR (Cohen's d = 0.79 in learning phase of experiment 2) is smaller than that of fear-conditioned HPR (Cohen's d = 0.97) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bach &amp; Melinscak, 2020)</ref>. Also, the response functions of these two differ from one another (RF for reward conditioning: = 1.72, [s -1 ] = 0.14, = 60.10, [s] = -17.61; RF for fear conditioning: = 48.5, [s -1 ] = 0.182, = 1, [s] = -7.36) (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref>). Compared to reward conditioning, the fear-conditioned responses appear narrower and returns to baseline more quickly. This could suggest a more vigilant preparatory reaction to successive behavioral response, which might be evolutionarily adaptive <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Andreatta &amp; Pauli, 2015)</ref>. Finally, there is evidence that fear-conditioned bradycardia is time-locked to US onset, that is, the onset of fearconditioned bradycardia moves as the time point of possible US delivery changes after CS onset <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Castegnetti et al., 2016)</ref>. In the present work, CS-US interval was not varied, such that we could not investigate this question for reward  Our recall test after 7 days revealed retention of the conditioned HPR in both experiments. To our best knowledge, no prior studies have assessed the retention of human reward learning memory after a delay of several days. The recall phase can be viewed as an extinction training due to the lack of reinforcers. Hence, it is interesting that there appears to be only limited extinction for reward learning.</p><p>Several reasons might be plausible. First, previous research on fear learning found that HPR is more resistant to extinction compared to SCR and saccadic scanpath length <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Xia et al., 2021)</ref>. It is possible that in the current paradigm, the number of trials ( <ref type="formula">96</ref>) is not sufficient to extinguish reward conditioning. Another potential explanation is that HPR becomes habitual during learning and looses its dependence on US outcome predictions <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Pool et al., 2019)</ref>.</p><p>4.1.2. SCR did not discriminate CS+/CS-difference in learning Interestingly, we did not find evidence that SCR discriminated CS+/CS-difference during the learning phase, although this measure was indeed sensitive to reward conditioning in most previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Andreatta &amp; Pauli, 2015</ref><ref type="bibr">, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Ebrahimi et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Klucken et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Kruse et al., 2017</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Kruse et al., , 2020;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Tapia León et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">van den Akker et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Wardle et al., 2018)</ref>. Upon a closer look, it seems that the US type and response quantification approach influenced whether SCR discerned CS+/CS-difference. There were two main US types (primary reinforcers such as snacks, fruit juice; secondary reinforcers such as monetary reward) and two response quantification approaches (model-based approach such as psychophysiological models, non-model-based approach such as through-to-peak approach) in previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Andreatta &amp; Pauli, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Ebrahimi et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Kruse et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">van den Akker et al., 2017)</ref>. All previous work employing non-modelbased approaches, particularly the through-to-peak and baseline-to-peak methods, have found CS+/CS-difference in SCR, regardless of the US type <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Andreatta &amp; Pauli, 2015</ref><ref type="bibr">, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Klucken et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Kruse et al., 2017</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Kruse et al., , 2020;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Tapia León et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Wardle et al., 2018)</ref>. In contrast, research utilizing model-based approaches (PsPM GLM and Ledalab), with primary and secondary reinforcers, presents mixed evidence. Among these, only one study out of five (including the present work) has found a difference in SCR between CS+ and CS- <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Ebrahimi et al., 2017</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Ebrahimi et al., , 2019;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Pietrock et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">van den Akker et al., 2017)</ref>. Collectively, these findings could suggest that model-based approaches may be less effective in detecting CS+/CS-differences in SCR, for example because they did not assume the correct underlying model of SCR generation. However, the heterogeneity of peak-scoring schemes in previous work and the limited number of studies warrant caution.</p><p>Another interpretation is that different primary reinforcers (fruit juice in the present work, snacks in some previous work) elicit different CR, potentially due to differences in arousal elicited by the US.</p><p>4.1.3. PSR discriminates CS+/CS-difference in recall but not during learning Unexpectedly, we did not find replicable CS+/CS-difference based on PSR during learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Bray et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Pietrock et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Pool et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Prévost et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Seymour et al., 2007)</ref>, despite our reward-conditioning paradigm being closely modelled on <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Pietrock et al.

This might strengthen contingency awareness, which in turn could affect PSR <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Van Dessel et al., 2019)</ref>.</p><p>The second is the CS sensory modality. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Pietrock et al. (2019)</ref> used compound CS (i.e., visual and auditory stimuli presented simultaneously). Finally, other previous reward-conditioning studies that revealed CS+/CS-difference for PSR employed a reinforcement rate larger than the 50% used here <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(O'Doherty et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Pool et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Prévost et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Reinhard &amp; Lachnit, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Schad et al., 2020)</ref>. On the other hand, PSR distinguished CS+/CS-early during recall, with the largest effect size in both experiments when averaging over 7 CS+ and 7 CS-trials. How this discrepancy between initial learning and recall can be reconciled is unclear at this point.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Future directions</head><p>The present work raises several important questions. First, it remains unclear how reward and fear conditioned HPR differ from each other, and what their adaptive value might be. Second, variability of paradigm characteristics may influence the reliability of measurement. Future work may systematically examine the roles of these characteristics (e.g., reinforcement rate, US expectancy, type of CS and US stimuli, SOA, etc.) in reward learning. Third, in both our experiments, the effect size of the HPR largely decreased from the learning to the memory retention phase. On the other hand, PSR robustly differentiated CS+/CS-during recall but not early learning. Hence future research could investigate the temporal dynamics of PSR and HPR as markers of reward learning.</p></div>

Fear-conditioned bradycardia has been linked to behavioural freezing (immobility), which might have adaptive value in certain defensive situations (Roelofs &amp; Dayan, 2022), although we note other work has demonstrated that freezing can co-occur with tachycardia as well as with bradycardia (Signoret-Genest et al., 2023), such that this link remains speculative.</figDesc></figure>
