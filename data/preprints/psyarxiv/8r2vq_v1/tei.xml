<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Cognitive dysfunction is essential to conceptualizing, defining, and assessing much of psychopathology. Despite this prominence, cognitive abilities are not included in the prevailing empirically based classification system: the Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology (HiTOP). This gap exists because the factor analytic literature HiTOP is based on has solely used reporter measures rather than neuropsychological tests needed to measure cognitive ability.</p><p>Given HiTOP's influence on research and clinical practice, the omission of cognitive functions from the model is consequential. This study aimed to determine how cognitive abilities fit into the empirical structure of psychopathology with a meta-analytic joint factor analysis. We pooled data from three published meta-analyses into a single correlation matrix of 8 DSM disorders and 7 cognitive functions. We then fit a series of models to the meta-analytic correlation matrix using exploratory factor analysis, and correlated factors across levels to estimate the hierarchical structure. The highest level of the model included a general factor with strong loadings of all disorders and cognitive functions (median l= |.51|, range = |.30| -|.64|). At the lowest level were three superspectra including 1) psychosis and cognitive dysfunction, 2) externalizing, and 3) emotional dysfunction. Our results show cognitive abilities can be integrated into the HiTOP model and point to actionable next steps in research to accomplish this goal.</p><p>Because HiTOP provides empirically validated phenotypes, this framework has advanced research on etiology, risk factors, mechanisms, and outcomes of psychopathology (Kim et al.,    </p></div>

In fact, some forms of psychopathology are defined almost exclusively by impairments in cognition (e.g., dementia, learning disorders, intellectual disability; <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Andrews et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Sachdev et al., 2009)</ref>. Cognition is considered so essential to psychopathology that it is one of the domains in the National Institutes of Mental Health's Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) initiative <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Morris &amp; Cuthbert, 2012)</ref>. Despite the prominence of cognitive dysfunction in how mental disorders are conceptualized, defined, and often treated, they are not included in the prevailing empirically based classification system: the Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology (HiTOP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Kotov et al., 2017</ref><ref type="bibr">(Kotov et al., , 2021))</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Omission of Cognitive Functions from the Empirical Structure of Psychopathology</head><p>The HiTOP model defines psychopathology in terms of hierarchically organized dimensions with narrow signs, symptoms, and behaviors at the base that combine into increasingly broad constructs, up to the superspectra level <ref type="bibr">(i.e., emotional dysfunction, externalizing, psychosis)</ref>. This model represents the consensus among a vast literature on the empirical structure of psychopathology and reflects a broader shift in clinical science away from DSM diagnoses and towards transdiagnostic, dimensional models <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Dalgleish et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>to psychopathology (e.g., by limiting coping resources) <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Pruessner et al., 2020)</ref>, psychopathology can lead to cognitive impairments (e.g., mood-induced memory problems) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Abramovitch et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Everaert et al., 2022)</ref>, and cognitive dysfunction and psychopathology could have shared etiology (e.g., genetics) <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Smeland et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Wootton et al., 2023)</ref>. Thus, there are arguments in favor of conceptualizing cognitive dysfunction as separate from psychopathology or as a fundamental part of it like any other symptom. However, limitations of existing research have prevented an empirical answer to this question of how cognition fits into the structure of psychopathology.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Prior Work on Relations between Psychopathology and Cognitive Functions</head><p>Although extensive in scope, research relating psychopathology and cognitive abilities has major methodological limitations. Most of this research has been on single DSM disorders, with results suggesting the presence of widespread cognitive deficiencies. Meta-analyses have concluded there is evidence for dysfunction in nearly all major domains of cognition (e.g., executive functioning, memory, processing speed, visuospatial abilities) for major depressive disorder <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Rock et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Snyder, 2013)</ref>, anxiety disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Moran, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Shi et al., 2019)</ref>, eating disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Smith et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Stedal et al., 2021)</ref>, obsessive-compulsive disorder <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Abramovitch et al., 2013)</ref>, alcohol and substance use disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Crowe et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Lee et al., 2019)</ref>, psychotic disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Au-Yeung et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Schaefer et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Ventura et al., 2010)</ref>, and bipolar disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Bourne et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Dickinson et al., 2017)</ref>. It is difficult to draw firm conclusions from this research though because each individual study has typically focused on one or two disorders and often related to just one or two domains of cognition. This narrow focus is a problem because DSM diagnoses co-occur more often than not <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Caspi et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Kessler et al., 2005)</ref>, which makes it unclear whether the observed impairments are specific to a certain form of psychopathology. Likewise, functioning across cognitive domains tends to be correlated, so it is unclear from this research whether a disorder relates to dysfunction in a specific area of cognition or whether the dysfunction is more pervasive. In sum, by failing to account for intercorrelations between disorders and between cognitive functions, it remains unknown whether cognitive deficits relate to psychopathology in general or specifically to some forms, and whether cognitive deficits are global when they occur, or some functions are more impaired than others in a given mental disorder.</p><p>A relatively small body of research addresses these problems of overlapping symptoms by examining cognitive functions in relation to HiTOP dimensions. Results from this literature are mixed and provide limited insight into how cognition fits into the empirical structure of psychopathology. Some findings suggest cognitive abilities relate more strongly to general versus specific aspects of psychopathology <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Pettersson et al., 2021)</ref>, whereas others find that general and specific psychopathology show a similar profile of cognitive deficits <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Caspi et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Southward et al., 2023)</ref>. Other findings suggest only one dimension is primarily deficient, although in some studies that dimension was externalizing <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Du Pont et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Nigg et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Pettersson et al., 2021)</ref> and in others it was psychoticism <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Jonas et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Stein et al., 2023)</ref>. There is also some evidence in youth samples that each form of psychopathology associates with a different type of cognitive deficit <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Bloemen et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Rotstein et al., 2023)</ref>.</p><p>The source of discrepancies across these studies is unknown-it could be due to variation in the subsets of disorders that were modeled, the cognitive domains examined, the particular neurocognitive tests administered, or sampling variability. Moreover, because these studies modeled psychopathology and cognition separately, they still do not answer the fundamental question of whether cognitive functions can be integrated into existing HiTOP dimensions or if they form a separate domain(s).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Joint Structure of Psychopathology and Cognitive Functions</head><p>The most direct approach to understanding how cognition fits into the structure of psychopathology is to estimate their joint structure. Only three studies have taken this approach.</p><p>In two of these studies, it was concluded that cognition is best conceptualized as a separate domain based on the superior global fit of a confirmatory factor model with separate cognitive/psychopathology factors compared to models with joint factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Eadeh et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Rotstein et al., 2023)</ref>. The third study arrived at the same conclusion based on the finding that cognitive abilities did not load onto a general factor alongside personality, personality disorders, psychopathology <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Littlefield et al., 2021)</ref>. These studies have at least two limitations that undermine the conclusion that cognition is separate from psychopathology. First, these studies did not assess schizophrenia symptoms, although they are associated with some of the most severe cognitive deficiencies <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Abramovitch et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">East-Richard et al., 2020)</ref>. Second, these results from hypothesis-driven analyses testing only one or two candidate models may have missed an integrated structure of psychopathology and cognition that fits the data best. Datadriven, exploratory factor analyses would enable a more exhaustive search of cognitionpsychopathology relations and stronger conclusions about the joint structure.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Present study</head><p>The present study aimed to determine how cognitive abilities fit into the empirical structure of psychopathology with a meta-analytic joint factor analysis. We knit together the fragmentary literature on DSM diagnoses and cognitive abilities by combining data from three published meta-analyses into a single correlation matrix. By pooling data across more than a hundred studies, we were able to account for method variance (due to e.g., different neuropsychological tests) and sampling variability that likely contributed to mixed results in previous studies. Furthermore, instead of comparing a small number of hypothesized structures like has been done in all prior joint factor models, we sought a data-driven solution with exploratory factor analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head><p>Code and data needed to reproduce our analyses and supplementary materials can be found on the Open Science Framework page for this study (https://osf.io/mgxht/).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Description of datasets</head><p>Data from three meta-analyses were combined to create a complete correlation matrix of DSM disorders × cognitive functions. Detailed information about the datasets can be found in the original studies, but we describe them briefly below along with adjustments made for the present analysis.</p><p>Disorder × disorder correlations were drawn from <ref type="bibr">Ringwald and colleagues' (2023)</ref> meta-analysis on the structure of DSM disorders. All samples from factor analytic studies of interviewer-assessed DSM disorders in adult samples were included in this meta-analysis. Metaanalytic correlations were estimated by pooling study-level correlations and weighting by sample size with a univariate random effects approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Hedges &amp; Vevea, 1998)</ref>. Source studies included assessments of dichotomous diagnoses and symptom counts, so the correlations were a combination of tetrachoric and Pearson's r.</p><p>Cognitive function × cognitive function correlations were obtained from Agelink and colleagues' (2020) meta-analysis on the structure of cognitive functioning. All studies reporting the factor structure of neuropsychological tests in cognitively healthy adult samples were included. Some cognitive domains from the source studies could not be included in the metaanalytic structural model reported by Agelink and colleagues due to insufficient data. Specifically, due to requirements of their meta-analytic modeling approach, domains for which pairwise complete correlations were unavailable had to be excluded. For the present study, we added data from another sample, which allowed us to include measures of nonverbal memory and visuospatial abilities that were not in the original meta-analysis. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> The sample added was the expanded Halstead-Reitan Battery normative dataset <ref type="bibr">(eHRB;</ref><ref type="bibr">Heaton et al., 1991)</ref>, which is considered to be one of the most comprehensive neuropsychological test batteries administered to a large (N = 460), demographically diverse sample of cognitively healthy adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Patt et al., 2018)</ref>. We pooled the raw correlation matrices of samples available for public sharing from the Agelink and colleagues' database that had our variables of interest (see the supplementary materials for a list of contributing studies) along with the eHRB sample using the same univariate random effects pooling approach employed for the disorder × disorder correlations.</p><p>All correlations were Pearson's r.</p><p>Disorder × cognitive functions correlations were obtained from Abramovitch and colleagues' (2021) systematic review of meta-analyses on cognitive functioning related to DSM disorders. Inclusion criteria were meta-analyses comparing neuropsychological test performance of adults who met criteria for a DSM disorder versus non-psychiatric controls. Unweighted mean effect sizes were reported as Cohen's d. For the present study, we converted the ds to rs with a two-step procedure: We first converted the ds to point-biserial rs <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Rice &amp; Harris, 2005)</ref>, then converted the point-biserial rs to biserial rs <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">(Terrell, 1982)</ref>. Biserial r was used to appropriately represent associations between the continuous neuropsychological test scores and dichotomous group membership (i.e., clinical vs. control), which was assumed to be drawn from a normally distributed continuum of psychopathology. Conversions at both steps were adjusted for population base rates of the disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Hudson et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Kessler et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">van Os &amp; Reininghaus, 2016)</ref>. Base rates are reported in the supplementary materials.</p><p>After making the reported adjustments for our analyses, the total number of studies contributing to the disorder × disorder correlations was 35 (N = 120,596), 45 studies (N = 54,686) for the cognitive function × cognitive function correlations, and 63 meta-analyses (N = 144,324 clinical participants) for the disorders × cognitive functions correlations. Number of studies per correlation are reported in the supplementary materials.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data harmonization</head><p>Each meta-analysis contained partially overlapping constructs. Because our analyses required a complete correlation matrix, we could only retain constructs for which every pairwise correlation with other constructs in the model were available. In cases that a correlation was missing, we had to listwise delete one construct in the pair. Decisions about which construct to omit were guided by the goal of maximizing content coverage and recovering as many factors as possible. Specifically, we aimed to include at least two diagnoses per each of the HiTOP superspectra (i.e., externalizing, emotional dysfunction, psychosis; <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Jonas et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr">Krueger et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Watson et al., 2022)</ref> for well-defined factors to emerge and to include constructs representing most major domains of cognitive functioning (i.e., executive functioning, attention, memory, processing speed, visuospatial abilities).</p><p>A total of 8 DSM diagnoses were retained based on overlap between Abramovitch and Ringwald and colleagues' meta-analyses <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Abramovitch et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Ringwald et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>Externalizing disorders included were alcohol use and substance use disorders<ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">2</ref> . Psychoticism spectrum disorders were schizophrenia<ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">3</ref> and bipolar disorders. There were 5 emotional dysfunction diagnoses in common between the source meta-analyses. However, we omitted PTSD because keeping it would require dropping a vital cognitive domain (i.e., set shifting). As a result, the emotional dysfunction disorders included were panic disorder, eating disorders (anorexia and bulimia), obsessive compulsive disorder, and depression.</p><p>After exclusions were made on the basis of available disorder correlations, 7 cognitive functions were retained. These functions included set shifting, working memory, and fluency within the executive functioning domain, verbal and nonverbal memory in the memory domain, processing speed, and visuospatial abilities. Neuropsychological tests used to assess cognitive functioning domains are in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. As shown in the Table, every cognitive domain was measured by multiple tests, ensuring minimal influence of task-specific variance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data analysis</head><p>To estimate relations among psychopathology and cognitive functions, we fit a series of structural models to the meta-analytic correlation matrix using exploratory factor analysis. Models were estimated in Mplus . The pooled matrix was non-positive definite because each meta-analytic correlation in the matrix was estimated separately and due the inclusion of tetrachoric correlations. To accommodate these conditions, we used unweighted least squares (ULS) estimator , , which does not require positive definiteness <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Li, 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Our aim was to identify a hierarchical model with as many levels as possible. To accomplish this, we estimated models with 1-8 factors. Given that global fit statistics and standard errors (and associated significance testing) are not available for models with ULS estimation, we evaluated models based on the effect size of factor loadings and factor interpretability. We considered primary loadings for a factor to be those &gt; |.35|. After determining the lowest level of the hierarchy, we correlated factors at subsequent levels to estimate the hierarchical structure (i.e., correlated the general factor with factors from the twofactor model and factors from the two-factor model with factors from the three-factor model).</p><p>Typically, factor scores are correlated across levels with this modeling approach. But since factor scores require individual-level data that were unavailable in the pooled correlation matrix, we used congruence coefficients instead following precedence of prior work <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">(Ringwald et al., 2023)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>The meta-analytic correlation matrix is in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>. Several disorders were notably associated with deficits in certain cognitive functions (i.e., rs &gt; .30). Focusing on these relatively strong correlations, depression was associated with worse set-shifting and visuospatial abilities, obsessive-compulsive disorder with worse nonverbal memory, alcohol use disorder with worse set-shifting, and bipolar disorders with worse verbal memory and processing speed. There were also a number of correlations just below .30. In contrast to these somewhat circumscribed deficits, psychotic disorders were associated with deficits in all cognitive functions.</p><p>The hierarchical model of psychopathology and cognitive abilities is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>.</p><p>Factor loadings and factor intercorrelations for each level are in Table <ref type="table">3</ref>. All disorders and cognitive functions loaded strongly onto a general factor in the one-factor model (median l= |.51|, range = |.30| -|.64|). Only eating disorders did not have a primary loading on this factor (i.e., l &lt; .35). The median size of disorders factor loadings was slightly lower than cognitive functions (l= |.44| versus |.53|). In the two-factor model, emotional dysfunction disorders split off into a separate factor, with cognitive dysfunction, psychotic disorders, and externalizing disorders marking the first factor. In the three-factor model, externalizing disorders formed a separate factor, whereas psychotic disorders remained on the first factor alongside all cognitive functions. Solutions with four or more factors were not interpretable and contained evidence of overextraction (i.e., Heywood cases, singlet factors). Thus, the lowest level of the hierarchy in our final model consisted of three superspectra: 1) psychoticism and cognitive dysfunction, 2) externalizing, and 3) emotional dysfunction. The top marker of the first factor was psychotic disorders, alcohol use disorders for externalizing, and panic disorder for emotional dysfunction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>This study used meta-analytic joint factor analysis to unify the piecemeal literature on DSM diagnoses and cognitive abilities and answer the question of how cognitive abilities fit into the empirical structure of psychopathology. Our results show that in the current HiTOP model, deficiencies in executive functioning, memory, processing speed, and visuospatial abilities are part of the psychoticism superspectrum. These findings lay the foundation for a more comprehensive classification system of psychopathology that includes cognitive abilities, and we provide concrete, actionable recommendations for future research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary of Findings and Connections to Prior Work</head><p>The principal finding of this study is that cognitive functions can be integrated into the structure of psychopathology. Bivariate associations for several disorders and cognitive abilities were substantial with correlations of up to r = -.43. Also, in our one-factor model, we found a balanced construct composed of roughly equal parts psychopathology and cognitive abilities.</p><p>Moreover, a separate cognitive factor never emerged, even after extracting up to eight factors.</p><p>At the lowest level of our hierarchical model, psychoticism and cognitive abilities formed a single factor, which adds more direct evidence for speculation that cognitive deficits are especially pronounced in the psychosis superspectrum <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Jonas et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Michelini et al., 2021)</ref>. This conclusion has been based primarily on indirect comparisons of studies on single DSMdefined disorders and a few studies comparing cognitive functioning of psychotic disorders to one or two non-psychotic disorders (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Reichenberg et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Sheffield et al., 2018)</ref>. Our meta-analysis goes beyond speculation by pooling these studies together into a single model and statistically isolating the common variance to show there is indeed a privileged relation of psychoticism to cognitive dysfunction.</p><p>Our results support a different conclusion than the few prior studies that have tested a joint factor model of psychopathology and cognitive abilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Eadeh et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Littlefield et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Rotstein et al., 2023)</ref>. Existing evidence suggested they are separate constructs, and none have placed cognition in the psychoticism superspectrum. These studies are not directly comparable to our meta-analysis given that two were in youth samples <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Eadeh et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Rotstein et al., 2023)</ref> and different operationalizations of cognitive dysfunction/psychopathology were used (e.g., self-report psychopathology, a cognitive ability index including standardized college admission test scores <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[Littlefield et al., 2021]</ref>). Aside from these sources are variability, there are three other explanations for the divergence in results. One reason previous studies failed to support the integration of cognitive functions into psychopathology is that those models may have been more influenced by method variance. Because these studies used one instrument for psychopathology and one for cognition (or a disproportionate number of reporter measures to neuropsychological tests), the separate factors may reflect different measures rather than different constructs. Our meta-analysis pooling across many assessment instruments and cognitive tasks limited measure-specific variance to produce estimates that may be closer to the "true" associations.</p><p>A second possible reason for divergence in findings is the difference in samples studied.</p><p>The disorder × cognition correlations in our study were obtained from a meta-analysis of case control studies whereas prior work on the joint structure used unselected samples. Case-control studies, which sample people at the most severe (i.e., diagnosed cases) and least severe ends (i.e., healthy controls) of the psychopathology distribution, may have amplified the differences in cognitive abilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Fisher et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Preacher et al., 2005)</ref>. This potential effect of sampling may be most pronounced for psychoticism-related disorders given the low base rates in unselected samples. Unselected samples represent psychopathology dimensions better by capturing the middle of the distribution and may provide a more accurate estimate of associations. On the other hand, unselected samples with mostly unimpaired cognition and subclinical levels of psychopathology (e.g., students, Prolific workers, youths sampled before age of risk for psychosis)--and particularly low representation of psychoticism--may have insufficient variance to detect their associations. Future research can address these issues by examining the joint structure in samples representing a fuller range of psychopathology severity <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(Stanton et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>A third way our study differs from prior work is that we took a fundamentally different, and arguably more rigorous, approach to testing the placement of cognitive abilities in the psychopathology structure. All prior studies used confirmatory factor analysis to test a small number of hypothesized solutions that imposed stringent and unrealistic assumptions of simple structure (i.e., no disorder cross-loadings). In contrast, our exploratory factor analytic approach relaxed the assumptions of simple structure and allowed for essentially any configuration of cognitive and psychopathology factors to emerge that best fit the data. Thus, our data-driven solution summarizing findings of 80 independent studies and 63 meta-analyses encompassing over 300,000 participants offers unprecedented evidence that cognitive abilities can, in fact, be integrated into the structure of psychopathology.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Implications and Future Directions for Nosology, Research, and Clinical Practice</head><p>Our meta-analysis suggests that HiTOP's psychoticism superspectrum could be revised to include impaired executive functioning, processing speed, and visuospatial abilities. This revision would align with the ICD-11 in which cognition is already a qualifier for a diagnosis of schizophrenia <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Gaebel, 2012)</ref>, and with the perspective of some scholars that cognitive impairments are actually the core pathology of psychoticism <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Kahn &amp; Keefe, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Rapoport et al., 2012)</ref>. However, before this revision can be made, the results need to be replicated in a population-based sample to ensure they are not unduly affected by case-control studies, as noted in the previous section. Additionally, although cognitive abilities fell within the psychosis superspectrum, it remains unclear how they relate to its component psychoticism and detachment spectra. We expect that in the lower-order structure of psychoticism, most cognitive deficiencies will be in the detachment spectrum. This hypothesis is based on consistent findings indicating that cognitive dysfunction is most closely linked to negative symptoms and disorganization, but not reality distortion symptoms <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Dibben et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Dominguez et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Ventura et al., 2010)</ref>. It is also plausible that a tripartite structure akin to schizotypy (i.e., trait psychoticism) would emerge <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Kwapil &amp; Barrantes-Vidal, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Tandon et al., 2009)</ref>, with some or all cognitive deficits forming a separate factor alongside detachment (i.e., negative symptoms) and psychoticism (i.e., positive symptoms) spectra. Once structural evidence for joint psychoticism and cognitive dysfunction factors are established, it would require validation before conclusions can be made about its superiority to the alternatives <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Forbes et al., 2024)</ref>.</p><p>It is also possible that cognitive abilities will fall in domains other than psychoticism when modeled with wider representation of psychopathology than were available for the present study. In particular, we expect that many cognitive deficiencies will be related to neurocognitive and neurodevelopmental disorders--which are disorders not currently in the HiTOP model.</p><p>Adding these disorders to the model has been a high priority <ref type="bibr">(Forbes, in press; Michelini et al., in press</ref>). However, one of the biggest barriers to this goal has been the reliance on reporter measures in structural research rather than neuropsychological tests that are best suited to assess the cardinal symptoms of cognitive dysfunction. We also expect that some cognitive abilities that were unavailable for our analyses will link most strongly to externalizing and emotional dysfunction constructs. Namely, deficits in attention, planning, and response inhibition are consistently observed in externalizing psychopathology, and, although the evidence is less consistent, poor episodic memory, response inhibition, and performance monitoring relates to subfactors of emotional dysfunction <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Michelini et al., 2021)</ref>. In sum, future research can build on the precedent we set by modeling a wider range of psychopathology and cognitive abilities, which we anticipate will eventually lead to changes throughout the HiTOP model.</p><p>Merging cognitive functions and psychopathology into a unified HiTOP framework can stimulate new hypotheses and accelerate research on their relations. Because the bulk of prior research has been on heterogenous DSM-defined diagnoses, often in isolation and in relation to one or two domains of cognition, it has been difficult to make progress in understanding which cognitive deficits are general or specific to a given form of psychopathology. Mapping cognitive abilities on to more precise phenotypes (i.e., HiTOP dimensions instead of DSM diagnoses) can help resolve this issue. For example, locating various cognitive abilities in the psychosis superspectrum would be a more parsimonious way to test whether the cognitive deficits seen across psychoticism-related disorders reflect variation in severity or kind compared to the usual approach of comparing the cognitive abilities of groups with different psychotic disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Gotra et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Hill et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Tamminga et al., 2014)</ref>. Including cognitive abilities in HiTOP would also allow us to build on well-established theory and research from cognitive science about the basic processes underlying neuropsychological test performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Keefe, 1995)</ref>. Such a bridge between basic science and clinical science would also create a more direct interface between the HiTOP and RDoC, enabling a synergistic approach to understanding psychopathology <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Michelini et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>Adding cognitive abilities measured by neuropsychological tasks to the HiTOP model could address some problems created by reliance on reporter methods. One of these problems is symptom equifinality. That is, there are symptoms that appear superficially similar but have essential differences that are not captured by reporter measures <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Forbes, 2021)</ref>. Most germane to the current study, reporter methods typically do not (or cannot) differentiate symptoms arising from deficit ability versus psychological factors like motivation or mood. To take one example, although concentration problems are observed in many disorders, they often associate with executive functioning deficits when they co-occur with externalizing symptoms (e.g., ADHD) but less so when they co-occur with emotional dysfunction symptoms (e.g., depression) suggesting distinct underlying mechanisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Fasmer et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Paucke et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>Incorporating cognitive abilities into the structure could therefore clarify the nature of symptoms in a way that is not currently possible.</p><p>Furthermore, the expansion of HiTOP to include task-based assessments need not be limited to cognitive abilities-many other psychopathology-relevant behaviors measured by nonneuropsychological laboratory tasks could be added to the model. For instance, incentive delay tasks measure variation in reward processing relevant to disinhibited externalizing <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Balodis &amp; Potenza, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Plichta &amp; Scheres, 2014)</ref>, the effort expenditure rewards task measures behavior related to anhedonia <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">(Treadway et al., 2009)</ref>, theory of mind tasks assess social cognitive deficits observed in psychoticism or autism <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Bora et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Senju, 2012)</ref>, and economic games tap interpersonal tendencies like spitefulness associated with antagonism <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Edershile, 2022)</ref>.</p><p>Defining HiTOP constructs based on multi-method data would enrich their nomological networks, resulting in a more valid and useful classification system.</p><p>A clinical implication of expanding the definition of psychopathology writ large to include cognitive abilities is that neuropsychological tests should be regularly administered alongside reporter measures-not just when a neurodevelopmental/neurocognitive disorder is suspected as is often the case. Unfortunately, neuropsychological tests are resource-intensive.</p><p>There are abbreviated and automated tests available that may be more feasible for clinical practice <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Berry et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Gur et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Keefe, 2004)</ref>, but our results reinforce a need to develop more abbreviated and valid instruments for this purpose. Another way to make neuropsychological testing more feasible would be to administer single tasks in a modular fashion when certain symptoms are endorsed in the same way optional subscales of some clinical interviews or self-reports are currently used. A more accurate and precise mapping of symptomcognition correlations achieved by further research on their joint structure will allow us to identify such brief, neuropsychological screeners for other psychiatric conditions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations</head><p>Our meta-analysis has some limitations. First, correlations in the model were drawn from different populations (e.g., cognitively healthy samples, epidemiological samples, clinical samples), and therefore may not be invariant. Second, as noted, the inclusion of case-control studies in the disorder × cognitive functions portion of the matrix may have inflated the correlations, especially with psychoticism. Third, and also noted previously, our models were limited by the disorders and cognitive domains available for inclusion. Finally, we used heterogenous DSM disorders as markers rather than homogenous trait dimensions or narrow symptoms. Due to these limitations, our results do not necessarily imply a definitive placement of cognitive abilities in the HiTOP model. Instead, we view our results primarily as proof-ofconcept that HiTOP can incorporate cognitive abilities specifically, and non-reporter measures of psychopathology generally.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>This study provides meta-analytic evidence that cognitive abilities can be integrated into the empirical structure of psychopathology. We hope our study is one small step that becomes a giant leap for HiTOP towards a more complete and useful classification system that expands beyond reporter measures.    </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
