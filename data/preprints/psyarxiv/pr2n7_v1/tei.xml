<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Psychological distress that stems from racial discrimination experiences may depend on how strongly individuals identify with their race. Existing findings across survey research and a small body of experimental research are equivocal on whether and how racial identity factors exacerbate or buffer the negative psychological effects of racial discrimination. This study included experimental and survey data to characterize the moderating roles of racial identity centrality, private regard, and public regard in the associations between racial discrimination and psychological distress. Participants were 240 young adults of color (Mage=23.27; 50.8% women; 37.5% Asian American, 35.4% Hispanic/Latino, 15.8% Black/African American). Findings generally converged across experimental and survey methods. Simulated and measured racial discrimination predicted psychological distress outcomes, but racial identity factors did not moderate these associations. Considerations for these null results and future research directions are discussed.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Does Racial Identity Moderate Psychological Effects of Racial Discrimination? Converging</head><p>Results from Experimental and Survey Data Ethnoracial mental health disparities can be attributed to racial inequities and disproportionate stress experienced by people of color <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Vines et al., 2017)</ref>. Particularly, racial discrimination is one form of stressor theorized to cause psychological distress, and other negative health outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Williams et al., 2019)</ref>. Understanding who may be more or less impacted by racial discrimination given their racial identity is an important step toward designing clinical interventions to promote mental health among people of color. The degree to which people are negatively impacted by racial discrimination experiences may vary as a function of personal attributes, such as individual differences in racial identity. Research on racial discrimination and racial identity largely has relied on survey designs and correlational analyses (see examples, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Cobb et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">French &amp; Chavez, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Rivas-Drake et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Sellers et al., 2006)</ref>; these studies do not allow researchers to make conclusions about the causal effects of racial discrimination and moderating roles of racial identity in these effects. Namely, it is challenging to conclude whether interactions between racial discrimination and racial identity are because of true moderation by racial identity in the psychological effects of racial discrimination, or because racial identity influences how individuals recall and report of racial discrimination experiences in surveys. This study was aimed to examine possible moderation by racial identity in the associations between racial discrimination and psychological distress, using experimental and survey data with the same set of research participants in the United States.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Racial Discrimination Is Theorized to Cause Psychological Distress</head><p>According to the acute racism reactions model and biopsychosocial stress model, racial discrimination elicits immediate stress reactions and causes chronic stress 10/18/2024 1:28:00 PM. The transactional model of stress and coping <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Lazarus &amp; Folkman, 1984)</ref> and the reserve capacity model <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Gallo &amp; Matthews, 2003)</ref> help explain these theorized effects further. When individuals are exposed to threatening events such as racial discrimination and when psychological burden of these events exceeds their resources to cope, racial discrimination can exert adverse effects on mental health <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Berjot &amp; Gillet, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">A. Ong et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Vines et al., 2017)</ref>. Examples of everyday racial discrimination include being treated with less respect than other people, being called names or insulted, and receiving poorer service than others because of people's ethnoracial backgrounds <ref type="bibr">(Williams et al., 1997)</ref>. Research has demonstrated robust associations between racial discrimination and various psychological outcomes such as stress, negative affect, mood disorders, anxiety disorders, and substance use disorders among people of color from diverse ethnoracial backgrounds compared to their White counterparts <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Brondolo et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Lee &amp; Ahn, 2011</ref><ref type="bibr">, 2012</ref><ref type="bibr">, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Lewis et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Ong et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Paradies et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Pascoe &amp; Richman, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Vines et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Williams et al., 2019)</ref>.</p><p>Most of these existing findings are derived from survey studies that rely on retrospective, self-reports of racial discrimination experiences (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Lewis et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Neblett, 2019 for review)</ref>. These studies preclude researchers from making causal conclusions about the effects of racial discrimination on psychological distress for several reasons. First, existing self-report discrimination measures ask participants to recall their discriminations over varying time periods including over the last day, month, and year. Individuals may not accurately remember instances of racial discrimination that have occurred over long time frames <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Neblett, 2019)</ref>. Second, similarly to other self-report survey research, measured racial discrimination may be fraught with recall and reporting biases. Individuals across personal attributes and lived experiences may over-report or under-report experiences of racial discrimination because of vigilance bias (i.e., interpreting events to be discriminatory) or minimization biases (i.e., not registering discriminatory events as such; <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Kaiser &amp; Major, 2006)</ref>. Without standardization of racial discrimination stimuli presented to individuals, and ensuring that racial discrimination events occur before the experiences and reports of psychological distress, researchers cannot rule out alternative factors that explain the associations between observed racial discrimination and psychological distress.</p><p>Independent of how racial discrimination is operationalized across experimental or survey research, existing studies also show considerable heterogeneity in the strength of the associations between racial discrimination and psychological distress across individuals (see reviews, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Lee &amp; Ahn, 2011</ref><ref type="bibr">, 2012</ref><ref type="bibr">, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Lewis et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Paradies et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Pascoe &amp; Richman, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Vines et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Williams et al., 2019)</ref>. Personal attributes such as individuals' positive feelings about their racial group likely influence people of color's mental health and the psychological effects of racial discrimination.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Racial Discrimination</head><p>One key set of personal attributes associated with psychological outcomes and effects of racial discrimination has to do with racial identity. Racial identity characterizes how people conceptualize their social position as a member of their racial group <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Cross Jr., 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Sellers et al., 1998)</ref>. For many people of color, racial identity is very important to their overall sense of self <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Tamir, 2022)</ref>. Research has shown that racial identity can promote resilience among individuals in stressful environments <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Butler-Barnes et al., 2018)</ref>. Racial identity also can shape how individuals appraise and cope with racial discrimination. For example, people of color who identify more strongly with their racial group have been shown to attribute ambiguous events to be related to race than those who do not identify as strongly with their racial group <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Operario &amp; Fiske, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Shelton &amp; Sellers, 2000)</ref>.</p><p>Racial identity has been conceived to comprise multiple components, thus how it is associated with psychological distress alone, and how it interacts with racial discrimination experiences in predicting psychological distress likely vary by dimensions of the construct.</p><p>Three stable dimensions of racial identity have been examined in existing research: centrality, private regard, and public regard <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Sellers et al., 1998)</ref>. 1 Centrality refers to the extent to which an individual's race is a core part of their self-concept. Private regard refers to an individual's positive or negative evaluative judgment about their own membership in a racial group. Public regard refers to people's positive or negative perception of how others evaluate their racial group.</p><p>Social identity and self-categorization theories help conceptualize how these different dimensions of racial identity relate to people's mental health, and protect against or exacerbate the negative psychological effects of racial discrimination <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Tajfel &amp; Turner, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Turner et al., 1987)</ref>. On the one hand, social identity theory posits that people generally are motivated to maintain a positive self-view in general and when faced with stress <ref type="bibr">(Tajfel &amp; Turner, 1984)</ref>.</p><p>Thus, individuals who have a stronger sense of racial centrality and more positive private regard may enjoy better mental health, and are better equipped to cope with threats to their identity such as racial discrimination. On the other hand, self-categorization theory posits that racial discrimination can function as contextual clues that heighten people's awareness of systemic 1 Sellers' 1998 model proposes other dimensions of racial identity including salience, nationalist ideology, oppressed minority ideology, assimilationist ideology, and humanist ideology. However, the centrality and regard (e.g., public and private) dimensions have been identified as the key dimensions in understanding experiences and psychological consequences of discrimination <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Sellers et al., 2006)</ref> and have been the most frequently studied in the existing literature using this model.</p><p>disadvantages and oppression facing their racial group, thus greater racial centrality and more negative public regard may intensify stress reactions to racial discrimination experiences <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Turner et al., 1987)</ref>. So far, there have not been consistent empirical results on these theorized associations linking racial discrimination, racial identity, and psychological outcomes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mixed Evidence on How Racial Identity Moderates Associations Between Racial</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discrimination and Psychological Distress</head><p>Survey studies-most of which have been derived from cross-sectional data-have yielded a wide range of effect sizes in the moderating associations of racial discrimination x racial identity with psychological distress. Some of these findings fall in different effect directions, casting doubt on whether and how racial identity moderates the associations between racial discrimination experiences and psychological distress. Some studies suggest that centrality <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Caldwell et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Cobb et al., 2019)</ref>, private regard <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Lui, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Rivas-Drake et al., 2008)</ref>, and public regard <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Seaton &amp; Iida, 2019)</ref> reduce the associations between racial discrimination and psychological distress. By contrast, other studies suggest that centrality <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Burrow &amp; Ong, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Lui, 2020)</ref> and public regard <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Caldwell et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Sellers et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Sellers &amp; Shelton, 2003)</ref> strengthen the associations between racial discrimination and psychological distress. There also are investigations that show null results on the moderating roles of all three dimensions of racial identity <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(French &amp; Chavez, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Huynh &amp; Fuligni, 2010)</ref>. Furthermore, meta-analytic results aggregating effect sizes from 18 survey studies failed to show statistically significant moderations by centrality, private regard, and public regard in the associations between racial discrimination and psychological outcomes <ref type="bibr">(Yip et al., 2019)</ref>.</p><p>A small body of experimental studies have shown some consistent results associating racial discrimination x racial identity with psychological outcomes. Using vignettes and video clips to simulate experiences with racial discrimination, two studies showed that higher levels of racial private regard reduced autonomic stress responses and momentary alcohol craving <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Desalu et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Neblett &amp; Roberts, 2013)</ref>. Both experimental investigations also showed that higher levels of racial centrality exacerbated the effects of racial discrimination on autonomic stress responses and alcohol craving, but results from these investigations did not converge on findings related to public regard <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Desalu et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Neblett &amp; Roberts, 2013)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Observed Moderation by Racial Identity May be Obscured in Survey Studies of Racial</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discrimination and Psychological Distress</head><p>Mixed results on the moderating roles of racial identity in the associations between racial discrimination and psychological distress may be driven by variations in methodological designs in existing studies. Experimental studies tend to expose individuals to simulated or imagined racial discrimination and measure psychological responses as they occur. By contrast, existing survey studies do not examine racial discrimination as people experience it. Researchers have tended to ask individuals to report racial discrimination experienced over the lifetime <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Rivas-Drake et al., 2008)</ref>, the past year <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Caldwell et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Sellers et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Sellers &amp; Shelton, 2003)</ref>, the past six months <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Lui, 2020)</ref>, and the previous day <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Burrow &amp; Ong, 2010)</ref>. Very few investigations have examined the psychological effects of racial discrimination in real time (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Desalu et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Neblett &amp; Roberts, 2013</ref> for examples). How people appraise and report their racial discrimination experiences may vary in real time as compared to their recall of their past experiences. These differences may be driven by personal attributes such as racial identity. For example, people with higher levels of racial identity centrality have been shown to report more daily encounters of racial discrimination <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Burrow &amp; Ong, 2010)</ref>. Perhaps, people who are more connected to their racial group membership are also more vigilant about and aware of racial discrimination events when they occur. Results from the same study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Burrow and Ong (2010)</ref> also showed higher levels of racial private regard to be associated with fewer number of racial discrimination events each day. Perhaps, people who feel good about their racial group can deploy psychological resources to cope with racial discrimination. To examine whether racial identity exacerbates or buffers the causal effects of racial discrimination on psychological distress, it is important that racial identity does not also influence how people recall and report past racial discrimination experiences. Experimental research allows researchers to expose participants to standardized racial discrimination stimuli without relying on participants to recall and report past experiences. This helps enhance the internal validity of empirical results on not only the psychological effects of racial discrimination, but also moderation by racial identity in their associations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Present Study</head><p>The goal of our present study was to examine whether and how racial identity moderated the causal associations between racial discrimination and psychological distress. Considering existing mixed results across experimental and survey studies on the moderating roles of racial identity on the associations between racial discrimination and psychological distress, we evaluated the moderations using experimental and survey data collected from the same set of research participants. Given the relative advantage of experimental research to survey research in determining causality, we simulated life-like racial discrimination experiences in a betweengroups experiment and measured people of color's self-reported stress and negative affect in real time. Consistent with most existing studies, we measured past racial discrimination experiences over the lifespan and general perceived stress in a set of cross-sectional surveys. Racial identity centrality, private regard, and public regard were tested as moderators in the associations between simulated and measured racial discrimination experiences and psychological distress outcomes.</p><p>First, we expected both experimental and survey data to show associations between racial discrimination experiences and psychological distress. Specifically, we hypothesized that participants assigned to experience simulated racial discrimination would report greater stress and negative affect than participants in the non-discrimination control condition (H1). We also hypothesized that individuals who reported greater frequency of lifetime racial discrimination would report greater perceived stress (H2).</p><p>Second, we expected racial identity to moderate the associations between racial discrimination experiences and psychological distress. Based on theories and prior empirical results, we hypothesized that centrality would intensify the effects of simulated racial discrimination experiences on stress and negative affect (H3), and the observed associations between measured lifetime racial discrimination and perceived stress (H4). We also hypothesized that private regard would buffer the causal effects of simulated racial discrimination on stress and negative affect (H5), and the observed associations between measured lifetime racial discrimination and perceived stress (H6). Finally, we posed a nondirectional hypothesis that public regard would moderate the experimental effects of racial discrimination on stress and negative affect (H7), and the observed associations between racial discrimination and perceived stress (H8).</p><p>Our present data were mainly drawn from a registered report study designed to examine the effects of simulated racial discrimination experiences on stress and alcohol craving in a sample of young adults of color <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Lui et al., 2023)</ref>. The registered report study was a betweengroups experiment in which 184 research participants were assigned to experience varying levels of racial discrimination or non-discriminatory daily hassles simulated using virtual reality technologies. We sampled an additional 54 research participants assigned to the nondiscriminatory daily hassles condition for the present study using the same study procedures as in the registered report study. Virtual reality allows researchers to create immersive environments that generate life-like experiences and genuine psychological responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Lui et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Rosa &amp; Breidt, 2018)</ref>. Stress and negative affect were measured through self-reports in real time whereas survey data on lifetime racial discrimination and general perceived stress were collected during the same study visit that the experiment occurred.</p></div>

They identified as Asian/Asian American (37.5%), Hispanic/Latino/Spanish American (35.4%), Black/African American (15.8%), and Native American and/or multiracial (11.3%). Participants reported gender identities as follows: men (45.8%), women (50.8%), transgender (0.8%), and nonbinary/genderfluid individuals (2.5%). Most participants (76.3%) reported to be heterosexual, 11.7% bisexual, 4.2% gay, 2.9% pansexual, 3.3% queer, 1.3% asexual, and 0.4% lesbian. The sample comprised 56.7% full-time undergraduate students and 43.3% community adults. Participants completed the study either in person in Dallas, Texas (55.8%) or Seattle, Washington (23.3%), or remotely from across the United States (20.8%).</p><p>Participants were eligible to participate in the study if they consumed alcohol at least once in the past month. Exclusion criteria included international or foreign exchange student status, and reports of motion sickness or epilepsy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study Design, Procedures, and Materials</head><p>The study protocol was approved by the institutional review boards at Southern Methodist University and University of Washington. Procedures in the parent study are reported in a published registered report <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Lui et al., 2023)</ref>. The parent study was a between-groups experiment in which participants were assigned to receive either daily hassles unrelated to race/racism in the control condition, or one of three forms of everyday racial discrimination in the experimental condition. Racial discrimination experiences ranged from microinvalidation, to microinsult, to blatant discrimination. We used virtual reality technologies to simulate daily hassles and racial discrimination experiences. Our study protocol took about 60 minutes. During the study session, participants provided informed consent, completed two VR simulations and associated measures for the dependent variables, and responded to a set of survey questionnaires about their typical experiences and individual difference characteristics.</p><p>Both VR simulations depicted a house party at which each participant interacted freely with an avatar. The avatar was controlled by a research actor, who used a semi-structured script to carry on conversations with the participant to simulate either racial discrimination experiences or daily hassles. The first simulation was designed to familiarize each participant with the VR technologies and immersive environment. In this simulation, participant engaged in a casual, non-stressful conversation with a White female avatar. The second simulation was designed to induce stress associated with either everyday racial discrimination or daily hassles. Survey data were collected following VR simulations. Survey questionnaires included assessments of lifetime experiences with racial discrimination, general perceived stress, and racial identity. All participants received either $30 or research credits as incentives for their time.</p><p>Initial data collection took place during 2021-2022 in Dallas, Texas. We recruited participants from the local communities and a college setting through social media ad campaigns, flyers, mass emails to students of color at a local university, and the psychology subject pool. We used a stratified randomization strategy for participant assignment to either the control condition or one of the racial discrimination conditions. As described in <ref type="bibr">Lui et al., 2023, participants</ref> completed the study procedures either in person or remotely.</p><p>Additional data collection took place in 2023 in Seattle, Washington, to increase the sample size in the control condition. The parent study compared three varying levels of intensity of discrimination experiences against the non-discriminatory daily hassles control condition, and found that the three discrimination conditions were not statistically different from each other <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Lui et al., 2023)</ref>. For the present study, we combined the three discrimination conditions into one broad discrimination condition to represent a wide range of discrimination experiences.</p><p>Because the parent study evenly divided participants between the four study conditions (i.e., three levels of discrimination and non-discriminatory daily hassles), for the purposes of the present study, we would have had a sample that had many more participants in the discrimination condition than the control condition when we combined the discrimination conditions. Thus, for the present study, we recruited an additional 54 participants to result in a more even distribution of participants between the discrimination and non-discrimination daily hassles conditions for the present study. We used social media postings, flyers, and the psychology subject pool at a local university to recruit full-time undergraduate students and community adults. Participants completed the study in person and were assigned to receive daily hassles unrelated to race/racism during the experimental VR simulation.</p></div>

The content of the discrimination conditions were based on vignettes that have been validated to represent varying severity levels of everyday racial discrimination experiences including microinvalidations, microinsults, and blatant discrimination <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Lui et al., 2020)</ref>. The content of the semi-structured scripts were constructed as defined by Sue's taxonomy <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Sue et al., 2007)</ref>. The microinvalidation condition consisted of assumptions including foreigner in own land, color blindness, myth of meritocracy, and denial of individual racism. The microinsult condition consisted of themes including ascription of intelligence, second class citizenship, pathologizing cultural values or communication styles, and assumption of criminal status that varied slightly based on the self-reported race of the participant. The blatant discrimination condition consisted of name-calling, avoidant behavior (e.g., looking away), and purposefully discriminatory actions directed toward the participant's race. The non-discrimination control condition consisted of stressful conversation topics unrelated to the racial background of the participant, and included discussions around finances, final exams, and employment.</p><p>Stress Rating. Our first dependent variable was self-reported stress rated immediately following the experimental simulation of racial discrimination or daily hassles. Participants also rated their stress levels immediately before the VR simulation, using a handheld controller. A visual analog of a stress meter was displayed at the bottom of the screen. Stress levels ranged from 0 (not at all) to 100 (extremely stressed). This measure of stress has been used in previous research, which has demonstrated adequate construct validity and reliability <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Muaremi et al., 2013)</ref>.</p></div>

We used negative affect items from the Positive and Negative Affect Scale. Participants rated the degree to which they experienced negative feelings such as anger and sadness on a scale from 1</p><p>(not at all) to 5 (very much). Participants also rated negative affect right before the experimental simulation.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Survey Questionnaires Assessing Lifetime Racial Discrimination, General Perceived Stress, and Racial Identity</head><p>Lifetime Racial Discrimination. We used the Everyday Discrimination Scale (EDS; D. R. <ref type="bibr">Williams et al., 1997)</ref> and the Major Experiences of Discrimination Scale (MDS; D. R. <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Williams et al., 2008)</ref> to capture the frequency by which participants encounter racial discrimination in their day-to-day life. The EDS and MDS together cover a broad range of everyday and blatant discrimination experiences. The EDS contained 10 items (e.g., "You receive poorer service than other people at restaurants or stores because of your race or ancestry") whereas the MDS contained 9 items (e.g., "Have you ever been unfairly prevented from moving into a neighborhood because the landlord or realtor refused to sell or rent you a house or apartment because of your race or ancestry). All items were rated on a scale from 1 (never) to 4 (often). These scale scores have shown reliability and criterion-related validity among people of color <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bastos et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Kim et al., 2014)</ref>. We conducted a principal axis factoring analyses in SPSS and found support for a unifactorial structure underlying the present data (40.65% explained by the first extracted factor (eigenvalue=7.72). The present scores assessing lifetime experiences with racial discrimination showed adequate internal consistency reliability (Cronbach's alpha=.92). We calculated a mean scale score such that higher scores indicated more frequent racial discrimination experiences. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Cohen et al., 1983)</ref>. We used the 10-item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) to assess general stress experienced over the last month. Items (e.g., "In the last month, how often have you found that you could not cope with all of the things that you had to do") were rated on scale from 1 (never) to 5 (very often). The PSS-10 has been reliably used across ethnoracial groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Baik et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Chen et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Makhubela, 2022)</ref>, and demonstrated adequate internal consistency reliability in the present sample (Cronbach's alpha=.88). <ref type="bibr">(Sellers, 1997)</ref>. Centrality, private regard, and public regard dimensions of racial identity were measured using the Multidimensional Inventory of Black Identity (MIBI). MIBI was initially developed for use with African American/Black individuals, and has been modified for use with other groups of color <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Yip et al., 2013)</ref>. Scale scores have shown adequate internal consistency reliability and convergent validity for use across ethnoracial groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Casey-Cannon et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Yip et al., 2013)</ref>. First, participants indicated their primary racial self-categorization (e.g., Asian American/Asian, African American/Black, Hispanic American/Latino). Then, they rated the degree to which they agreed with scale items in reference to their race. Items assessing centrality (8 items; e.g., "being ___ is an important part of my self-image"), private regard (7 items; e.g. "I feel that ___ have made major accomplishments and advancements"), and public regard (6 items: e.g., "Overall, ___ are considered good by others") were rated on a scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). The three scale scores demonstrated adequate internal consistency reliability in the present sample (Cronbach's alpha=.84, .79, and .87, respectively for centrality, private regard, and public regard).</p></div>

Thus, we recruited additional 54 research participants for the control condition. The added sample size was determined by time and available resources. The present sample included participants assigned to racial discrimination (n=141) and control (n=99) conditions. According to a sensitivity analysis with the current N=240, we would have 80% power to observe a smallest detectable moderation effect size of r/β=.22.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Analysis Plan</head><p>To test H1, we specified a multiple regression model examining differences in postsimulation stress by racial discrimination condition, controlling for pre-simulation stress.</p><p>Another multiple regression model was specified for negative affect. To test H2, we specified a multiple regression model regressing self-reported perceived stress on measured lifetime racial discrimination. To test H3 through H8, we specified a hierarchical regression model for each outcome variable. In Step 1, we included racial discrimination and each of the racial identity variables as predictors. In Step 2, we computed interaction terms between simulated or measured racial discrimination variables and racial identity variables (e.g., simulated racial discrimination x centrality, simulated racial discrimination x private regard, lifetime racial discrimination x centrality, lifetime racial discrimination x private regard) and added the interaction term into the regression model. We used the Mplus default maximum likelihood estimator in regression analyses on post-simulation stress and measured perceived stress outcomes. Because of non-normality in the residuals for post-simulation negative affect, we used the maximum likelihood estimator with robust standard errors.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Preliminary Analyses</head><p>We tested for systematic differences in demographic characteristics between racial discrimination and control experimental conditions, using N=184 from the parent study. We found no statistically significant differences between the discrimination and control conditions on demographic characteristics (see supplemental materials). Because we recruited an additional 54 participants from Seattle, Washington, all of whom were assigned to the control condition, we included data collection location as a covariate in all hypothesis-testing analyses to account for any systematic differences between samples that could not be accounted for by random assignment.</p><p>Table <ref type="table">1</ref> summarizes descriptive statistics on study variables retrieved from experimental and survey data and bivariate correlations among them. Higher levels of self-reported lifetime discrimination were linked to higher levels of self-reported perceived stress, and higher levels of stress and negative affect both before and after experimental manipulations of discrimination.</p><p>Higher levels of centrality were associated with greater frequency of lifetime racial discrimination, general perceived stress, and post-simulation stress. Higher levels of racial identity private regard were related to lower levels of lifetime racial discrimination, general perceived stress, post-simulation stress, and post-simulation negative affect. Racial identity public regard was not associated with lifetime racial discrimination, general perceived stress, or post-simulation stress or negative affect ratings. Pre-simulation ratings of stress and negative affect were robustly associated with post-simulation ratings; therefore, pre-simulation ratings of the relevant outcome variable were included as covariates in all analyses.</p></div>

Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> summarizes results testing H1 and H2. Both H1 and H2 were supported, and results from experimental and survey data converged. Controlling for data collection location and presimulation scores in the respective dependent variable, experimental data showed that participants in the racial discrimination condition reported higher levels of post-simulation stress (β=.36, p &lt; .001) and negative affect (β=.27, p &lt; .001) than participants in the control condition.</p><p>Survey data showed that more frequent lifetime racial discrimination experiences were associated with higher levels of general perceived stress (β=.40, p &lt; .001), even when controlling for data collection location. <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> summarizes results from hierarchical regression models testing H3 and H4. In Step 1, the main effects of the racial discrimination condition and centrality were examined. Relative to the control condition, participants assigned to the racial discrimination condition reported higher levels of post-simulation stress (β=0.40, p &lt; .001) and post-simulation negative affect (β=.30, p &lt; .001), over and above other predictors in the model. Higher levels of centrality were associated with greater post-simulation stress (β=0.20, p=&lt; .001) and post-simulation negative affect (β=.19, p &lt; .001). Survey data showed that more frequent lifetime racial discrimination experiences were associated with greater perceived stress (β=.06, p &lt; .001). Unlike results from the experimental data, however, centrality did not predict measured perceived stress (β=.12, p &lt; .273). In Step 2, racial discrimination x centrality did not predict post-simulation stress (β=.30, p=.166) and post-simulation negative affect (β=.21, p=.217) using experimental data, and measured perceived stress <ref type="bibr">(β=-.05, p=.846)</ref> using survey data.

Private regard did not predict measured perceived stress based on survey data (β=-0.12, p=.074). When we included the interaction term racial discrimination x private regard in Step 2, both experimental and survey data yielded no support for a buffering role of private regard in terms of post-simulation stress (β=0.62, p=.242), postsimulation negative affect (β=0.30, p=.431), and measured perceived stress (β=-0.16, p=.759).</p><p>Moderating role of public regard on the effects of simulated racial discrimination on stress and negative affect (H7) and on the associations between measured racial discrimination and perceived stress (H8).

In Step 1, accounting for other predictors in the respective model, public regard was not associated with either post-simulation stress (β=-0.11, p=.052) or post-simulation negative affect (β=-0.05, p=.368) using experimental data. By contrast, based on survey data, higher levels of public regard were associated with lower levels of perceived stress <ref type="bibr">(β=-0.20, p=.011)</ref>. Parameter estimates for racial discrimination x public regard interaction term showed that public regard did not moderate the effect of racial discrimination on post-simulation stress (β=-0.27, p=.124) and post-simulation negative affect (β=-0.19, p=.495), and did not moderate the association between lifetime racial discrimination and measured perceived stress (β=-0.08, p=.666).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>We examined the moderating roles of racial identity in the theorized effects of racial discrimination on psychological distress outcomes. Consistent with our first set of hypotheses, simulated and measured racial discrimination experiences were associated with higher levels of psychological distress. Contrary to our second set of hypotheses, racial identity centrality, private regard, and public regard did not moderate these associations. Given the existing equivocal findings on whether and how racial identity modifies the impact of racial discrimination on psychological outcomes-some of which may be attributed to diverse research methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Neblett, 2023)</ref>, a strength of our investigation is that we cross-validated these results using experimental and survey data with the same sample. Considering racial discrimination both simulated in a controlled environment and measured on a commonly used survey, our data show that racial identity does not interact with racial discrimination in its effect on psychological distress.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Racial Identity Is Associated with Psychological Distress Outcomes</head><p>Our observed bivariate correlations between racial identity variables and psychological distress outcomes align with assumptions that derive from social identity theories <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Tajfel &amp; Turner, 2004)</ref>, and generally are consistent with prior empirical findings <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Desalu et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Sellers et al., 2006)</ref>. Across acute and general psychological distress outcomes, we find that greater distress corresponds to higher levels of centrality and lower levels of private regard.</p><p>Psychological distress does not appear to be associated public regard, however. Considering the ubiquity of racism facing people of color in the United States, centering overall sense of self on their racial group membership may heighten psychological burden of structural disadvantages whereas feeling good about their race may promote feelings of belongingness and collective affirmation.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discrimination and Psychological Distress</head><p>Social identity theories have been used as guiding frameworks for conceptualizing whether and how racial identity moderates the psychological effects of racial discrimination.</p><p>Empirical evidence to date has not supported these theorized interaction effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Burrow &amp; Ong, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Desalu et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">French &amp; Chavez, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Huynh &amp; Fuligni, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Lui, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr">Yip et al., 2019)</ref>. Given the persistence and ubiquity of structural racism and insidious nature of everyday racial discrimination, racial discrimination experiences may be damaging to psychological functioning regardless of how people of color understand and internalize their social statuses.</p><p>Possible protections against racial discrimination may occur at the interpersonal and societal levels as opposed to at the individual level <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Pieterse &amp; Carter, 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Conclusions about the health-promoting and buffering effects of private regard bear distinct practical importance because culture-centered interventions have been developed to promote racial private regard to enhance psychological functioning and to reduce the harm of racial discrimination (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Coard et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">White &amp; Wanless, 2019)</ref>. Prior confirmatory findings may be false positives. As with most topical areas <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Aert et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Ferguson &amp; Heene, 2012)</ref>, published effect sizes documenting the moderation by racial identity likely are inflated because null results may be suppressed (see relevant discussion in <ref type="bibr">Yip et al., 2019)</ref>. As demonstrated in results from our sensitivity analysis, most studies likely require samples that are larger than what are represented in the literature (see discussion on power in moderation analyses in <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Vize et al., 2023)</ref>. Because most research on this topic has relied on survey methods, it also is possible that private regard simultaneously influences how people recall global racial discrimination experiences and their psychological distress status. Retrospective reporting of all three variables may have conflated the moderation role of private regard in the associations between racial discrimination and psychological distress outcomes.</p><p>We also consider two alternative reasons for being unable to detect a potentially true buffering role of private regard, and potentially true moderating roles of centrality and public regard: restriction of range in our observed private regard scores and sensitive time scale for capturing moderating effects of racial identity. First, our participants reported high levels of private regard; observed sample mean score was close to 6 (somewhat agree) on a scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). Limited variability in these scores may have constrained our ability to detect a moderation effect across experimental and survey data (see power discussion in <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Memon et al., 2019)</ref>. Our recruitment strategies appeared to have resulted in a sample of young adults of color who felt positively about their racial group.</p><p>Second, our research methods may have missed the sensitive time periods when private regard and public regard protect the psychological harm of racial discrimination, and when centrality worsens the effects of racial discrimination. Namely, racial discrimination not only causes acute psychological distress, but also may cause rumination <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bernard et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Borders &amp; Liang, 2011)</ref> that in turn leads to delayed distress and accumulated psychological burden. On the one hand, survey studies that reflect people's daily lived experiences show no moderation by any racial identity variables in the associations between same-day experiences with racial discrimination and same-day psychological outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Burrow &amp; Ong, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Huynh &amp; Fuligni, 2010)</ref>. On the other hand, survey studies that contain repeated measurements of self-reported racial discrimination experiences over one year show that centrality and public regard exacerbate the associations between racial discrimination and externalizing problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Caldwell et al., 2004)</ref>.</p><p>Whereas our experimental data help reflect the effects of simulated racial discrimination on momentary distress, our survey data help demonstrate shared variance between lifetime racial discrimination and global distress. These results do not capture how people may respond to racial discrimination over hours, days, and weeks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations of The Present Study</head><p>We consider several limitations in our study. First, in our experimental procedures, the avatar was presented as a White male. Even though simulated daily hassles did not involve interpersonal racial discrimination, financial, workplace, and/or educational challenges nevertheless might reflect structural disadvantages facing people of color. The White avatar coupled with participants' racial identity could have influenced post-simulation psychological distress ratings, therefore masking moderating effects by centrality, private regard, and/or public regard. Second, racial identity variables were measured after experimental simulations of stress.</p><p>Despite centrality, private regard, and public regard being conceptualized as stable characteristics <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Sellers et al., 1998)</ref>, simulations of racial discrimination could have increased the salience of race, and affected individuals' self-reports on these racial identity factors. Third, we measured lifetime racial discrimination experiences and perceived stress concurrently. We were unable to make causal conclusions about their associations. Fourth, our participants tended to feel positively about their racial group membership and reported relatively low levels of general stress. We also did not measure participants' household income or socioeconomic status. Current findings may not generalize to other segments of the population.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Future Research Directions</head><p>Converging results across experimental and survey data suggest that null findings on the moderating roles of racial identity factors are not driven by methodological differences. Still, our investigation reveals key directions in understanding how racial identity interact with racial discrimination in affecting people of color's psychological distress. First, future studies should use large sample sizes that ensure sufficient statistical power to detect the effect sizes of interest.</p><p>Second, research samples should be comprised of individuals with a range of scores on racial identity factors. Third, this literature would benefit from research methods that aim to reflect how racial discrimination and racial identity affect people in their daily lives <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Ong &amp; Burrow, 2017)</ref>. Specifically, (intensive) longitudinal surveys and experience sampling approaches can allow researchers to collect fine-grained data that capture when and under what contexts racial discrimination may affect psychological outcomes, and time scale that racial identity may modify these associations.</p><p>The likely complex associations among racial discrimination, racial identity, and psychological distress may not be best examined using quantitative, variable-centered methods.</p><p>Rather, qualitative research and quantitative, person-centered methods can be particularly beneficial in informing how people appraise and respond to racial discrimination, and how racial identity factors function as individual-level vulnerabilities or strengths. In-depth interviews and tools such as the UConn Racial/Ethnic Stress and Trauma Survey can be used to understand people's experiences with racism and discrimination from various sources, racial identity development, and psychopathology symptoms associated with these racialized factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Williams et al., 2018)</ref>. Person-centered analyses can help researchers identify profiles of racial discrimination experiences and racial identity factors that make people resilient against psychological distress (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Banks &amp; Kohn-Wood, 2007)</ref>. These scientific data can inform culturally responsive interventions that promote psychological functioning and reduce the negative effects of racial discrimination. <ref type="bibr">Yip, T., Wang, Y., Mootoo, C., &amp; Mirpuri, S.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Preliminary analyses from the original preregistered sample size of N = 184</head><p>For transparency, we report preliminary analytic results testing differences across experimental conditions using participant data from the parent study (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Lui et al., 2023)</ref>, as registered in the study plan archived in the Open Science Framework repository (<ref type="url" target="https://osf.io/hzyb6/?view_only=0fb019a153b34ab99f81ee6df13c0e58">https://osf.io/hzyb6/?view_only=0fb019a153b34ab99f81ee6df13c0e58</ref>). Differences in demographic characteristics and baseline stress ratings were examined between participants assigned to the discrimination conditions and control condition. Chi-square tests of independence showed that the discrimination group did not statistically significantly differ from the control group on ethnoracial background [χ 2 (3,185) = 1.70, p = .637]. Similarly, there were no differences between the discrimination group and the control group on gender [χ 2 (3,185) = 4.57, p = .206], participation method [χ 2 (1,185) = 0.06, p = .808], and student status [χ 2 (1,185) = 0.53, p = .469]. Independent samples t-tests showed that the control group did not statistically significantly differ from the experimental group on age, t(183) = 0.36, p = .720. There were no significant differences between the experimental and control group on stress ratings [t(178) = 0.01, p = .304] and negative affect [t(183) = -0.21, p = .831] measured before the experimental manipulations.</p><p>Differences in racial identity variables measured were explored between participants assigned to the discrimination conditions and control condition. Independent samples t-tests showed that the control group did not significantly differ from the experimental group on racial identity centrality, t(183) = 1.63, p = .105, public regard t(183) = -0.36, p = .720, or private regard t(183) = 0.50, p = .619.</p><p>Analyses were conducted to explore associations between demographic characteristics and outcome variables (i.e., post-simulation stress and negative affect) to determine whether it would be appropriate to control for any demographic variables in the planned analyses. Bivariate correlations showed that age was not statistically significantly associated with any of the study variables. One-way ANOVAs were used to examine post-simulation stress and negative affect scores by demographic and sample characteristics. Post-simulation stress (F(3,177) = 2.09, p = .104) and negative affect scores (F(3,179) = 0.23, p = .878) did not significantly differ by gender. There were no statistically significant differences in post-simulation stress (F(1,179) = 1.56, p = .214) and negative affect scores (F(1,181) = 2.06, p = .153) across participants who completed the study in person or remotely. Post-simulation stress (F(3,177) = 0.84, p = .472) and negative affect scores (F(3,179) = 0.11, p = .956) did not significantly differ by ethnicity.</p><p>There were no statistically significant differences in Post-simulation stress (F(1,179) = 0.43, p =.511) and negative affect scores (F(1,181) = 0.06, p = .805) across participants who were college students or community adults. Post-simulation stress (F(6,174) = 1.01, p = .421) and negative affect scores (F(6,176) = 1.49, p = .183) did not differ by sexual orientation.   </p></div>			</div>
