<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Political interest is fundamental to democratic engagement. Yet, its conceptualization remains debated. In this study, we offer a new but important perspective by conceptualizing political (dis)interest as a social identity. We introduce two innovative measures: the Positive Political Interest Identity Scale (PPIS) and the Negative Political Interest Identity Scale (NPIS).</p><p>Employing Item Response Theory, we validate the construct validity of both scales in a preregistered study in the Netherlands (N = 2,060). Using the same dataset, we also demonstrate their predictive validity. Importantly, the PPIS and NPIS uncover substantial differences in political attitudes and behaviors both between and within individuals who identify as politically (dis)interested. Recognizing political (dis)interest as a social identity enriches our understanding of the concept and its implications for politically relevant attitudes and behaviors, while also informing interventions to foster political interest equally across all citizens.</p></div>

We draw upon the stateof-the-art social identity literature, also recognizing that people can have multiple social identities within one-domain <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Kang &amp; Bodenhausen, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Klandermans, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Mason, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">McConnell, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">McConnell et al., 2013)</ref>. To be specific, we argue that political (dis)interest serves as both a positive identity, defining the self through identification with a (dis)interest category, and as a negative identity, defining the self through distancing from a (dis)interest category <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bankert, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Tajfel, 1981)</ref>.</p><p>We introduce our Positive Political interest Identity Scale (PPIS) and our Negative Political interest Identity Scale (NPIS). Using a split-half approach<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">foot_0</ref> , we first establish the construct validity of our scales through Item Response Theory using data from a preregistered study in the Netherlands (N=2,060) in December 2023. Next, we demonstrate the predictive validity of political (dis)interest as an identity. We associate our measures of positive and negative social identity with political attitudes and behaviors central to democracy. These results show that different levels of identification with (dis)interest in politics significantly affect broader political engagement and behaviors between and within groups. To summarize, our findings demonstrate that political (dis)interest indeed functions as a social identity, providing a new and enhanced lens to understand the nature of political (dis)interest.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Development and Stability of Political (Dis)Interest &amp; Social Identity</head><p>In this study, we explore and test whether political (dis)interest is a social identity. Two lines of research provide indirect evidence supporting our argument. First, longitudinal studies suggest that political (dis)interest forms during adolescence <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Hoskins &amp; Janmaat, 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Mattila et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Prior, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Russo &amp; Stattin, 2017)</ref>. Adolescence is a period crucial for developing personal identity <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Branje, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Crocetti et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Lannegrand-Willems et al., 2018)</ref> and social identity <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Albarello et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Tanti et al., 2011)</ref>. Early adolescents have a vague sense of self and are exploring various identities <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Meeus, 2011)</ref>. These can evolve into firm commitments in later teenage years depending on how carefully they think about those identities and how emotionally connected they feel towards them <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Mannerström et al., 2017)</ref>. Social identities offer younger people identity alternatives to facilitate exploration and provide input for personal identity formation <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Crocetti et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Tanti et al., 2011)</ref>. Crucially for our argument is that political (dis)interest appears to develop during this critical stage of social identity formation: adolescence.</p><p>A second indication that political (dis)interest functions as a social identity comes from the stability of political interest in adulthood. Studies which track the same individuals over many years and repeatedly measure their (dis)interest in politics show that political interest remains remarkably stable (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Mattila et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Neundorf et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Prior, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Russo &amp; Stattin, 2017)</ref>. Adults either maintain an ongoing interest in politics or they remain disinterested <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Prior, 2010)</ref>. Reflecting on the stability of political interest, <ref type="bibr">Prior (2010, p. 763)</ref> concludes that "political interest behaves like a central element of political identity, not like a frequently updated attitude".</p><p>The stability of political interest mirrors the enduring nature of partisanship which has also been established as a social identity <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Greene, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr">Huddy &amp; Bankert, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Huddy et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Observing that political interest develops in adolescence and is stable in adulthood provide first indications for our argument that political (dis)interest is a social identity. In the next section, we turn to the social identity literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Tajfel &amp; Turner, 1979;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Turner et al., 1987)</ref> to explore whether political (dis)interest qualifies as a social identity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Political (Dis)Interest as a Social Identity</head><p>People can define themselves by drawing to varying degrees on both personal and social identities <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Haslam, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Haslam &amp; Ellemers, 2005)</ref>. Social cognition research also shows that the self is organized in memory through multiple context-dependent "self-aspects" such as social roles or political identities <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(McConnell, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">McConnell et al., 2013)</ref>. Social identity is a part of a person's self-concept derived from their subjective sense of belonging to a group, including the value and emotional significance they attach to that membership <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Lannegrand-Willems et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Tajfel, 1981)</ref>. Measures such as the Identification with a Psychological Group scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Mael &amp; Tetrick, 1992</ref>) capture these key social identity aspects such as group belonging, emotional significance of group belonging, and feelings related to lower group status <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Ellemers et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Leach et al., 2008)</ref>. This sense of belonging varies among individuals: some have a stronger identity than others <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Huddy et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Tanti et al., 2011)</ref>. Importantly, social identities are fluid and shaped in the moment <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Haslam et al., 1992)</ref>.</p><p>Self-Categorization Theory (SCT) notes three factors that contribute to when and how likely we are to choose and act upon a specific group, called "social category salience" <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Haslam &amp; Ellemers, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Oakes, 1987)</ref>. Specifically, a social category, such as political (dis)interest, is salient depending on comparative fit, normative fit, and person readiness. Comparative fit refers to the way people categorize themselves and others into social groups by comparing the differences they see within a group to the differences between groups. People investigate how well a social category accounts for observed similarities and differences <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Tajfel, 1981)</ref>. If we apply this to political (dis)interest, people should be more inclined to identify as interested or disinterested based on whether differences between groups are more noticeable than differences within groups. This principle applies to domains like political engagement and behaviour, where individuals interested in politics differ significantly from those who are not across various factors such as political efficacy, knowledge, news consumption, and participation in both conventional and unconventional political activities (for a review <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Prior, 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Normative fit gauges how closely an individual's characteristics, behaviors, and attitudes align with the norms or expectations of a social group represented by the in-group prototype, i.e., the most ideal or typical model of a group member in a specific social context <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Hogg et al., 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Van Lange et al., 2011)</ref>. For example, STEM fields are often associated with men, leading to a "STEM identity" deficit amongst women <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Kim et al., 2018)</ref>. Similarly, political interest might also be seen as a male prototype. This highlights how, based on how well we or others conform to social group norms, normative fit influences the way we evaluate others and ourselves. Moreover, individuals interested in politics may see themselves as informed and responsible citizens, while perceiving the disinterested as lacking awareness, being indifferent to societal issues, or not fulfilling their civic duties. On the other hand, those uninterested in politics may view the politically engaged as overly opinionated or disconnected from everyday concerns, diverging from their own norms of disengagement from political matters.</p><p>Finally, perceiver readiness describes how a social group becomes prominent based on its importance to the individual or the situational accessibility. Therefore, political (dis)interest becomes a relevant social category if one values (dis)interest or if it is prominent in the immediate context.</p><p>Political interest might be more valued by those who feel a strong sense of civic duty, whereas disinterest is important to individuals who seek to avoid conflict or distrust political elites. Also, during periods of heightened political debate or elections, political groups, ideologies and polarization become more visible in both public and private discourse, as well as in media coverage.</p><p>Overall, the exploration of political (dis)interest as a social identity aligns with key criteria from the social identity literature: comparative fit, normative fit, and perceiver readiness. These factors suggest that political (dis)interest can function as a social category, reflecting the dynamic ways individuals define themselves within political contexts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Positive and Negative Social Identities</head><p>Individuals not only define themselves through the categories that they belong to. Identities can also form in opposition to groups to which they do not belong, a process known as negational categorization <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">(Zhong et al., 2008)</ref>. The idea that people can have both a positive and a negative social identity integrates insights from social identity, optimal distinctiveness, and balance theories <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Brewer, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Heider, 1946;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Tajfel &amp; Turner, 1979)</ref>. Positive identity involves how much an individual's self-concept is shaped by the shared characteristics of their in-group, emphasizing alignment with group values and goals. In contrast, negative identity involves the rejection or opposition to out-groups, focusing on distancing oneself from the values, beliefs, or behaviors associated with those groups.</p><p>Research conceptualising partisanship as a social identity shows that people can have both a positive party identity and a negative party identity <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Abramowitz &amp; Webster, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bankert, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Caruana et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Medeiros &amp; Noël, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Titelman &amp; Sajuria, 2023)</ref>. Both have different origins and characteristics <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bankert, 2023)</ref>, and it is possible to possess a positive identity without simultaneously having a negative identity, and conversely <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Abramowitz &amp; Webster, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Iyengar et al., 2012)</ref>. Interestingly, the in-group has been assumed to be "psychologically primary" <ref type="bibr">(Zhong et al., 2008, p. 794)</ref>. In line, positive identity has a stronger effect on vote choice and political engagement than negative identity <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bankert, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Medeiros &amp; Noël, 2014)</ref>. Attachment may be more important than rejection to motivate behavior.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Research Design: Preregistered Split-Half Approach</head><p>We developed an 8-item Positive Political Interest Identity Scale (PPIS) and an 8-item Negative Political Interest Identity Scale (NPIS). This study has two main parts: (1) assessing the construct validity of our newly developed scales and (2) evaluating their predictive validity.</p><p>Flycatcher recruited 2,060 participants in the Netherlands with quotas for education, gender, region, and age (see Table <ref type="table">A</ref>.1 for sample descriptives in Appendix 2). The survey ran in 2023 from December 15 to 22 and had ethical approval from the authors' institute. The questionnaire took 15-20 minutes and participants received three euros compensation. As preregistered in Preanalysis Plan (PAP) 1, a random 3/4 (N=1,553) of participants saw our identity scales due to time and budget constraints <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Lakens, 2022)</ref>.</p><p>We analyzed the data using a split-half approach illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. This method was preregistered in PAP 1 before data collection ended on December 19, 2023. After data collection, the data manager randomly split the sample in two. The first author received a data set containing a random split-half with only the items of the political (dis)interest scales (PPIS &amp; NPIS) to conduct exploratory analyses (EA) on the scale performance (Step 1 in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). We then preregistered our expectations of the scale performance in Pre-analysis Plan (PAP) 2 on February 8, 2024. The first author then received the second half of data only including again the scale items to conduct a confirmatory analysis (CA; Step 2, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Note: This flowchart shows the different steps taken within this study using the split-half approach.</p><p>Exploratory analyses on the left side were done using the same first split-half of the data. Confirmatory analyses on the right side were done using the second-split half of the data. The meta-analysis in Step 5 was done with the whole sample. The three pre-analysis plans (PAP) are listed in the dotted squares in the middle.</p><p>To evaluate the predictive validity of the scales, the data manager sent the same subset as used for Step 1 to conduct Step 3, but containing all the variables from the survey. After exploring the scales' relationships with six selected variables (Step 3) we preregistered our hypotheses in Preanalysis Plan (PAP) 3 on April 2, 2024. These were confirmed in Step 4 and in Step 5 through a confirmatory analysis and an internal meta-analysis for power reasons.</p><p>Step 1-2: Establishing the Scales' Construct Validity Determining the In-Group and Out-Group Before showing our scales to participants, they had to be allocated a political interest in-and outgroup. We first asked respondents what we refer to as the standard political interest measure: "Some people are very interested in politics, others much less. Where do you place yourself on a scale from not at all to very interested in politics?". Answer options were: (1) not at all, (2) a little, (3) fairly, or (4) very interested. Those who reported that they were "not at all" or "a little" interested were classified as uninterested and given the PPIS items that refer to those who are uninterested in politics as their in-group. The other participants who said that they were "fairly" or "very" interested in politics were classified as interested in politics and saw the version of the PPIS referring to interested people as their in-group (see section 1.1 Participants in Interested and Uninterested Group in Appendix 1 for how many people saw each version).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Political (Dis)Interest Scales</head><p>We adjusted the item-wording from the Identification with a Psychological Group scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Mael &amp; Tetrick, 1992)</ref> to measure political (dis)interest as a social identity.</p><p>Table 1 (translated) and Table A.2 (original in Dutch; in Appendix 2) list the eight items for the two developed scales.</p><p>We hereby follow work measuring partisanship as a positive social identity (in the Netherlands: <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Bankert et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Greene, 2004)</ref>.</p><p>The Positive Political interest Identity Scale (PPIS) gauges a person's psychological and emotional attachment to their political interest in-group. We ask for example how often statements like "I feel close to people who are (un)interested in politics" apply to them on a scale with four answer categories: never/seldom (1), sometimes (2), often (3), and always (4). In the PPIS, in-group can be people who are either interested or uninterested in politics. The items were presented in a random order.</p><p>Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bankert (2022)</ref>, we also measure the extent to which political (dis)interest centers around rejecting the political interest out-group. We ask for example how often statements like "I feel anger towards people who are (un)interested in politics" apply to them on a scale with four answer categories: never/seldom (1), sometimes (2), often (3), and always (4). The items were presented in a random order.</p><p>Table 1: Item Wording of the Political Interest Identity Scales.</p><p>Note: This table shows the scale items which were translated from Dutch to English. People were asked: "Indicate how often the following statements apply to you" with answer categories: never/seldom (1), sometimes (2), often (3), always (4).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Item Response Theory</head><p>We use Item Response Theory (IRT) to assess the measurement performance of the PPIS and NPIS.</p><p>For scale development, IRT shows how individual items relate to the construct being measured, with response likelihood depending on the person's latent trait as well as on item properties like difficulty, offering more flexibility and higher reliability than Modern Test Theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Ayala, 2013)</ref>.</p><p>As we work with ordered multi-categorical data, we specified uni-dimensional Graded Response Models (GRM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Samejima, 1969)</ref>. In the exploratory analysis (Step 1 in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>), we specified four GRMs (2 versions of the 2 scales = 4 GRMs) using the first split-half of the data. We preregistered acceptable scale criteria in PAP 2. In the confirmatory analysis (Step 2 in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>), we specified the same four models using the second split-half of the data. The following section reports and evaluates the measurement properties of the PPIS and NPIS based on how results from the confirmatory analysis align with the preregistered criteria in (PAP 2). Results for both the EA and CA can be generated separately through the replication files on the Open Science Framework (OSF).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Item descriptives can be found in Table <ref type="bibr">A.3 and Table A.4</ref> in the Appendix 2. In PAP 2 we preregistered three hypotheses:</p><p>• (H1) Political (dis)interest can be conceptualised as a social identity.</p><p>• (H2) Political (dis)interest can be measured through a positive identity scale.</p><p>• (H3) Political (dis)interest can be measured through a negative identity scale.</p><p>As IRT is primarily concerned with the relationship between individual scale items and the overall measured construct -here political (dis)interest identity <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Mazur, 2022)</ref>, we preregistered in PAP 2 an analysis strategy focusing on (1) item-level statistics and (2) person fit to evaluate our scales and test the hypotheses <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Mazur, 2022)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Item fit &amp; Item information</head><p>First, to evaluate the performance of each scale item, we rely on the S-X2 of <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Orlando and Thissen (2000)</ref> and the associated Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA). We conducted the item-fit test using the Benjamini-Hochberg correction to control for multiple testing <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Benjamini &amp; Hochberg, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Liu et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Sauder &amp; DeMars, 2020)</ref>. For each item, the RMSEA was lower than or equal to the preregistered threshold in PAP 2 of 0.08 (see Tables A.5, A.6, A.7, A.8 in Appendix 2) in the EA as well as in the CA <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Browne &amp; Cudeck, 1992)</ref>. The associated S-X2 statistic was also non-significant for all items in the EA (p&lt;.05), suggesting an adequate item fit <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Orlando &amp; Thissen, 2000)</ref>. In the confirmatory analysis, Item 1 in the NPIS was statistically significant for interested participants, p=0.008, and Item 3 in the NPIS for uninterested participants, p=.016. However, they fall within the preregistered IRT parameters outlined below.</p><p>For graded response models, each item is described by two parameters: Item discrimination parameters (α) and item difficulty parameters (β). First, higher α values suggest items that are effective at discriminating between individuals with different trait levels.  Note: This plot displays the contribution of each scale item to measuring the latent concept. Items can be found in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>.</p><p>Overall, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> shows that the introduced items are effective at discriminating between indi-viduals with different trait levels. Some items require some attention. In panel A (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>), the CA value for Item 4 (α=5.77) is above the threshold (α=4). However, further analysis does not indicate that the scale becomes more reliable when dropping this item (Cronbach's α=0.80 <ref type="bibr">[EA]</ref> and 0.84 <ref type="bibr">[CA]</ref>). In panel C (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>), the CA value for Item 8 (α=0.49) is just below the threshold (α=0.50). Further analysis indicates that reliability improves when Item 8 is dropped (Cronbach's α goes from 0.78 to 0.88 in EA and from 0.76 to 0.82 in CA). In panel D (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>), the CA value for Item 7 (α=0.35) is slightly below the threshold (α=0.50). Further analysis indicates that reliability improves when Item 7 is dropped (Cronbach's α goes from 0.76 to 0.79 in EA and from 0.68 to 0.71 in CA). Going forward, the wording of Items 7 and 8 could be simplified. Fit-issues can arise due to complex phrasing of questions.</p><p>Second, beta's represent at which trait level there is a 50% probability of scoring at or above an answer category on an item. We did not preregister expectations for this parameter. Nonetheless, the Item Information Curves show that the items cover a good range over the latent concept (see Figures A.1, A.2 in Appendix 2). Going forward, further studies might consider dropping items that cover the same ranges, selecting the item with the highest α value to be more time efficient.</p></div>

Person fit results can be found in Table <ref type="table">A</ref>.10 in the Appendix 2.

(2017)</ref>, we also verified whether both scales are indeed measuring two different constructs. These analyses were not preregistered and thereby exploratory.

The following section will also demonstrate that the scales are effective at differentiating between and within politically interested and uninterested people.</p><p>Step 3-5: Predictive Validity of Political (Dis)Interest Identity</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Scales</head><p>Having established the construct validity of our scales, we turn to their predictive validity. Here, we show that our interest identity scales have meaningful and substantive associations with political attitudes and behaviors, namely political activism, consumption of political news, openness to political news, political efficacy, confidence in political knowledge, and factual political knowledge.</p><p>We measured political activism by asking how likely participants were to engage in a set of five different political activities. Political news consumption refers to the self-reported frequency of consuming political news on a 7-point Likert scale. Three questions were asked about news avoidance (e.g., "I deny political news") on a 7-point Likert scale, which we reverse coded to reflect openness to political news for ease of interpretation. Political efficacy was gauged through six statements on a 7-point Likert scale. Items 3 to 6 were negatively phrased and were reverse coded.</p><p>Confidence in political knowledge was asked through three statements on a 7-point Likert scale.</p><p>Questions 2 and 3 were negatively phrased and were reverse coded. Factual political knowledge was assessed through four questions about Dutch politics (multiple choice). Originally, we had five questions. But question one was removed because of a coding issue in the survey. However, 92 percent gave the same answer on question one. For all variables with more than one item, we added the individual items, and then z-standardized all the variables. Table <ref type="table">A</ref>.11 contains the exact question wording for the outcomes, Table <ref type="table">A</ref>.12 the descriptives, and Table A.13 the psychometrics of the outcomes in the Appendix 2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Preregistered Modelling Strategy</head><p>We specified six three-way interaction models, one for each dependent variable (Step 3 in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</p><p>The following equation summarizes our three-way interaction models whereby we regress each of the six outcome measures on standard interest (coded as 0 [uninterested] and 1 [interested] to reflect the allocated groups), positive identity (PosId is the mean score on PPIS), negative identity (NegId is the mean score on NPIS) and all consecutive interaction terms. Finally, we control for age, education, gender (female) and ideology. The three-way interaction models allow us to explore how positive and negative identity, individually and combined, are associated with the specified outcomes, and whether these associations differ between interested and uninterested people (twosided, p &lt; .05). We investigate the interactions closer by analyzing the differences (contrasts) and similarities of Estimated Marginal Means (EMM) between each combination (two-sided, p &lt; .05). The individual contrasts, i.e., differences between each interest and identity combinations, can be generated using the replication files which can be found on OSF.</p><p>A post-hoc sensitivity analysis, using the InteractionPowerR package <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Baranger et al., 2023)</ref>, shows that our sample is sufficiently powered to reliably detect effect sizes of interest <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Lakens, 2022)</ref>. In both the exploratory and the confirmatory samples, we have enough participants to detect a two-way interaction effect of 0.16 (standardized) of PosId*NegId, 0.12 (standardized) of PosId*Interested, and of 0.11 of NegId*Interested. We expect that the three-way interaction effect that we can reliably detect will be slightly bigger than the two-way interaction effect: that said, this remains speculation at this point (see section 1.2 Power Analysis for Three-way Interaction Models in Appendix 1 for more information about the power analysis).</p><p>In the following section we evaluate our preregistered meta-analysis over the whole data set in relation to the four preregistered hypotheses in PAP 3. Results from the Exploratory Analyses</p><p>[EA] and Confirmatory Analyses [CA] can be derived individually from the replication files on OSF.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>The following results demonstrate that positive identity accentuates differences within individuals who are interested in politics, as well as within uninterested people. These differences are overlooked when relying solely on a conventional one-item measure of political interest. Specifically, positive identity is a statistically significant predictor for all six outcomes within the group of politically interested participants, and in five out of six outcomes within the group of uninterested people. The associations are also in the expected direction with large effect sizes of one to two standard deviations. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3</ref>  We discuss the relationships in detail, primarily referring to the preregistered hypotheses outlined in PAP 3. These hypotheses are based on the exploratory analysis (Step 3 in 1) . Note: This heatmap shows the estimated marginal means of 6 different regression models from the meta-analysis (each row is a model). The marginal means are based on three-way interaction models, distinguishing between uninterested (left) and interested (right) people and setting low and high negative and positive identity to one standard deviation under/above the standardized means of interested / uninterested participants. The dark blue squares indicate lower than average predicted values on the dependent variable, yellow squares indicate higher than average predicted values. The hypotheses were preregistered in PAP 3.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H1: Political activism</head><p>In PAP 3, we preregistered a three-way interaction effect whereby (h1a) interested people with both high negative and high positive identity report the highest level of political activism. First, we find in the meta-analysis that higher positive identity (b 2 =0.26, se=0.09) as well as higher nega-tive identity substantively increases reported political activity within the interested group (b 3 =0.20; se=0.07; see Table <ref type="table">A</ref>.14 for regression table in Appendix 2). Furthermore, although the three-way interaction term is not statistically significant within the meta-analysis, the Estimated Marginal Mean (EMM) for this specific identity combination (EMM=0.72, se=0.06) is statistically significantly higher compared to all other (dis)interest combinations. The darker yellow squares in row 1 of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3</ref> illustrate this. Within the group of uninterested people, we do not find any statistically significant associations between positive or negative interest identity and political activism.</p><p>We also preregistered a three-way interaction effect whereby (h1b) interested people with low negative identity and low positive identity do not differ from uninterested participants<ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">foot_1</ref> . As can be seen in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3</ref>, as well as in the interaction plot in Figure A.3 in Appendix 2, interested people with low negative identity and low positive identity (EMM=-0.07, se=0.06) do not differ much from uninterested participants (EMM=ranges from -0.35 to -0.31). Therefore, we accept h1a and h1b.</p><p>H2: Political efficacy (h2a), news consumption (h2b), and confidence in knowledge (h2c)</p><p>In PAP 3, we preregistered a two-way interaction effect whereby interested people with a high positive identity have the highest level on political efficacy (h2a), news consumption (h2b) and confidence in knowledge (h2c). Within the interested group, participants high on positive identity had substantively more confidence in their political knowledge compared to people who reported lower positive identity (b 2 =0.68, se=0.08) in the meta-analysis. Conversely, we find that a higher positive identity decreases confidence in political knowledge within the group of individuals uninterested in politics (b 2 =-0.27, se = 0.07). Negative identity had no statistically significant association with confidence in knowledge in both groups (b 3 [interested]=-0.02, se=0.07); b 3 [uninterested]=-0.02, se=0.05). As preregistered we find similar effects in the meta-analysis for positive identity when analyzing political news consumption (h2b) and political efficacy (h2a; see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">3 rows 2-3</ref>).</p><p>Overall, we confirm H2a-c that positive political identity is associated with higher political efficacy, more news consumption and higher perceived political knowledge among the politically interested participants. Moreover, positive identity is associated with lower political efficacy, news consumption and perceived knowledge among politically uninterested participants. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3</ref> highlights that participants with high positive identity have respectively the highest (interested; yellow squares) and lowest (uninterested; dark blue squares) values on news consumption, efficacy, and perceived knowledge.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H3: Political efficacy</head><p>We also preregistered in PAP 3 that (H3) people interested in politics with a low positive identity will have similar political efficacy scores as those uninterested in politics. We did not entirely replicate this pattern in the meta-analysis because of a coding error in the exploratory analysis<ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">foot_2</ref> .</p><p>With the correct coding, differences between and within the groups become starker. Positive identity becomes a statistically significant predictor for uninterested people. Moreover, in both interest groups, the three-way interaction becomes statistically significant and mirrors results for h2a-h2c (b 5 [interested]=-0.20, se=0.06); b 5 [uninterested]=0.14, se=0.04). The meta-analysis shows that interested participants with low positive identity (EMM=ranges from 0.11 to 0.16) have similarly low scores on political efficacy than uninterested people with low positive and low negative identity (EMM=0.05; see greyish squares in row 2 of Figure3).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H4: Political knowledge (h4a/c) and News openness (h4b/d)</head><p>In PAP 3, we preregistered a two-way interaction effect whereby uninterested people with high positive identity have the lowest level of political knowledge (h4a) and the highest level of news avoidance (h4b). We deviate from our PAP 3 by reverse coding news avoidance to reflect news openness so that all effects are in the same direction. In line with h4b, we find that for uninterested people, a higher positive identity reduces openness to news (b 2 =-0.32, se=0.09). Within the interested group, we find that a higher positive identity increases openness to news (b 2 =0.42, se=0.11).</p><p>Negative identity has no statistically significant association in both groups (b 3 [interested]=0.12, se=0.10); b 3 [uninterested]=-0.11, se=0.07). Row 6 in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3</ref> also illustrates that participants with high positive identity have respectively the highest (interested) and lowest (uninterested) values on news openness.</p><p>For political knowledge, we find that positive identity is negatively associated with knowledge within uninterested people in the meta-analysis(b 2 =-0.25, se=0.09). Within the interested group, positive identity is significantly associated with more political knowledge, but only in the metaanalysis (b 2 =0.23, se=0.11). However, in estimated marginal means, positive identity makes no difference within the interested group. Row 5 in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3</ref> shows that participants with high positive identity have the lowest (uninterested) values on political knowledge, but not necessarily the highest (interested) [see row 5 square "Interested highNeg lowPos"].</p><p>We also preregistered that uninterested people with low positive identity have similar levels of political knowledge (h4c) and news openness (h4d) than interested participants. First, one could argue that uninterested people with a low negative and a low positive identity have levels of news opennesss (EMM=0.04, se=0.08) that resemble those of interested people with low negative and low positive identity (EMM=0.26, se=0.08). However, we do not confirm h4d entirely as uninterested people with low positive and high negative identity are not similar to interested people.</p><p>Second, uninterested people with a low positive identity have similar levels of knowledge than all interested people (h4c), except for the interested with high positive and low negative identity. The greyish squares in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3</ref> row 5 illustrate this pattern.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion: Predictive validity of the PPIS and NPIS scales</head><p>We conclude that positively identifying with your in-group of (dis)interested people is correlated with large differences in several political outcomes. The differences between those that positively identify with political disinterest and those that positively identify with political interest is around one and two standard deviations on the tested outcome variables. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3</ref> illustrates this pattern with the dark blue colors on the left (lowest values for uninterested and positive identifying) and the yellow colors on the right (highest values for interested and positive identifying). We also find that for some outcome variables the values of disinterested and interested participants with low positive identity do not differ much. In sum, the identity scales we introduce significantly add to the predictive validity that the political (dis)interest concept has on political attitudes and behaviors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Exploratory test: The correlates of PPIS and NPIS</head><p>Who scores high or low on the PPIS and NPIS scales? To answer this we specified the same threeway interaction models in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4</ref> with demographics (gender, age, education) and personality traits (Big 5, self-esteem) as dependent variables<ref type="foot" target="#foot_3">foot_3</ref> (see Table <ref type="table">A</ref>.1 in Appendix 2 for descriptives).</p><p>We did not preregister this. Note: The marginal means are based on three-way interaction models, distinguishing between uninterested (left) and interested (right) people and setting low and high negative and positive identity to one standard deviation under/above the standardized means of interested/uninterested participants. The dark blue squares indicate lower than average predicted values on the dependent variable, yellow squares indicate higher than average predicted values.</p><p>In line with other research (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Prior, 2018)</ref>, the heatmap in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4</ref> shows that women are more likely than men to identify as uninterested. In this group, women report similar levels of both positive and negative identity. Moreover, younger people are more likely to identify positively with the uninterested group. There is greater variation within the interested group: younger people tend to have a negative view of those who are uninterested, while older individuals are more likely to view themselves as politically interested. In line with the broader personality and political interest literature (for a review see <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Bromme et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Freitag &amp; Zumbrunn, 2024)</ref> we find weak indications that personality traits set apart those being interested from those being uninterested in politics. Yet, we find that personality traits set-apart especially people within each group. A few results stand out: for the uninterested, higher levels of neuroticism are associated with high positive and high negative identity. Among the interested, those having a high positive and a high negative identity have lower levels of conscientiousness compared to those who have a weak positive and a weak negative identity. Overall, these results reveal significant variation both between and within the politically interested and uninterested groups, highlighting the range of factors linked to political identity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Political interest is crucial to the functioning of democratic societies. Yet, its conceptualization remains debated. The lack of consensus hinders efforts to understand what influences and causes political (dis)interest, limiting efforts to promote political interest effectively and equally among all citizens. This study addresses this by conceptualizing and measuring political (dis)interest as a social identity. We hereby follow a growing body of research highlighting the importance and existence of multiple social identities within politics (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Bornschier et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Egan, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Huddy, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Kang &amp; Bodenhausen, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Klandermans, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Mason, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">McConnell et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Wagner &amp; Eberl, 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">West &amp; Iyengar, 2022)</ref>. Our main contribution lies in demonstrating that political (dis)interest functions as a social identity, offering a new perspective on this concept and advancing our understanding of its implications for political engagement and behavior. Specifically, we demonstrated the construct and predictive validity of our novel measures which capture this social identity aspect of political (dis)interest. Using Item Response Theory, the most appropriate method for our assessments, we convincingly demonstrated that political (dis)interest can be accurately gauged through our newly developed Positive Political Interest Identity Scale (PPIS) and Negative Political Interest Identity Scale (NPIS). We also established the predictive validity of these scales by correlating them with six political outcome variables, revealing large variations on political activism, political efficacy, news consumption, news openness, confidence in knowledge and political knowledge between as well as as within the interested and uninterested group. These strong disparities would have gone unnoticed if we had only used (the) standard political interest measure(s).</p><p>The two main parts of this study, (1) assessing the construct validity of our newly developed scales and (2) evaluating their predictive validity, align with the social identity literature. We demonstrate a strong comparative fit, showing that (dis)interest in politics indeed constitutes a meaningful divide in society <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Krupnikov &amp; Ryan, 2022)</ref>. Our identity scales are good at discriminating across different trait levels, and highlight meaningful differences between those interested and disinterested in politics. Concerning differences within interested people, our findings align with recent work by <ref type="bibr">Krupnikov and Ryan (2022, p. 34)</ref>, who argue that "gradations [in people's relationships with politics] form an especially meaningful political divide in the highest categories of interest". Yet, our findings also uncover important variations within the uninterested group in the degree to which they positively identify with being uninterested, underscoring the importance of examining variability within both interested and disinterested individuals. We also show differences within both groups in how strongly individuals identify with their in-group, and disengage with their out-group <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Haslam &amp; Ellemers, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Turner et al., 1987)</ref>. Our findings also align with earlier studies showing that the strength of positive identification with one's in-group is linked to differences in attitudes and behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bankert, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Huddy, 2018)</ref>. This pattern holds true for both those who are interested and those who are not. The social identity approach suggests that stronger identification increases the likelihood of adopting or internalizing the group's typical values, norms, attitudes, and behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Huddy et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Tanti et al., 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Our results regarding negative identity are less conclusive. The findings align with the literature on partisanship which also shows that positive identity has better predictive validity than negative identity <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bankert, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Medeiros &amp; Noël, 2014)</ref>. Negative identity is however not the opposite of positive identity and may exert "different powers", relating to attitudes and behaviors which were not tested in this study <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Caruana et al., 2015)</ref>. Future research should explore when and how negative identity uncovers meaningful distinctions among politically (dis)interested individuals.</p><p>This study is only a starting point and we welcome further research to explore the construct and predictive validity of (dis)interest as a social identity across different contexts. First, to better understand political (dis)interest as a social identity, we need to know when and how it develops.</p><p>As our study relied on a cross-sectional design using a sample of Dutch adults, it cannot answer this. Given that political interest develops during adolescence <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Hoskins &amp; Janmaat, 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Prior, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Russo &amp; Stattin, 2017)</ref>, exploring the emergence and determinants of political (dis)interest as an identity requires tracking adolescents over time. Second, a person can belong to various socio-political groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Amiot et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Kang &amp; Bodenhausen, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Klandermans, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Mason, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">McConnell et al., 2013)</ref>. In politics, partisanship <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Huddy et al., 2018)</ref>, gender <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Boyer et al., 2022)</ref>, ethnicity <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Egan, 2020)</ref> nationality <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Huddy &amp; Khatib, 2007)</ref>, religion <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Margolis, 2018)</ref>, and political (dis)interest have been established as meaningful social identities to understand politically relevant attitudes and behaviors. Future research should explore how these identities are structured hierarchically.</p><p>To conclude, our main contribution lies in demonstrating that political (dis)interest functions and can be measured as a meaningful social identity. Our findings have also practical implications for stakeholders invested in fostering political engagement. For instance, interventions informed by the social identity approach aimed at modifying prototype content, as discussed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Kim et al. (2018)</ref> in their work on women in STEM, could prove invaluable in enhancing political interest. Specifically, social identity research suggests that modifying the in-group prototype (amongst group leaders) is highly effective in making the social category more inclusive, and thereby enhancing social identification <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Seyranian, 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Seyranian, , 2017;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Tajfel, 1981)</ref>.</p><p>Recognizing that political (dis)interest is a social identity helps our understanding of the concept and its repercussions, while also providing stakeholders with tools to cultivate political interest equally amongst all citizens. By establishing political (dis)interest as a meaningful social identity, our research deepens understanding of its implications for inclusive democratic engagement. .</p><p>Table A.2: Item Wording of the Political Interest Identity Scales (Dutch Version).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">Power Analysis for Three-way Interaction Models</head><p>To be specific, in both split-halves, we have enough participants to detect a two-way interaction effect of b = 0.16 (standardized) of PosId*NegId, b = 0.12 of PosId*Interested, and of b = 0.11 of NegId*Interested. This means we can detect small interaction effects. Note that at this point we limit sensitivity to two-way interactions. In the next iteration of the paper we also include the power analysis for the three-way interaction. These are complicated and we need more time to conduct these. Yet, we expect that the three-way interaction effect that we can reliably detect will be slightly bigger than the two-way interaction effect: that said, this remains speculation at this point.</p></div>
