<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The increasing prevalence of youth with overweight has made understanding its causes highly important. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> Individual differences in body mass index (BMI) are shaped by the complex interplay between genes and environment whereby young people's choices and responses to changes in their environment are influenced by their genetic makeup. During adolescence, food decisions become less dependent on parents, and individuals start making their own dietary and lifestyle choices. Once moved out of the parental home, adolescents and young adults are even more independent in shaping their health-related habits. The transition from adolescence to young adulthood is therefore a critical phase where gene-environment interactions (G×E) might substantially influence variation in BMI outcomes. For instance, those at higher genetic risk for overweight seem more prone to cravings for foods high in fat and sugar that influence their environmental choices. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> Thus far, our understanding of genetic and environmental contributions to weight has largely relied on twin studies. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> These studies have demonstrated that genetic influence on BMI varies across development, with heritability estimates increasing during childhood and adolescence and peaking at the onset of adulthood. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> More recently, findings from twin samples have been confirmed by molecular genetic studies that focused on individual differences in DNA structure and variation in traits, such as overweight. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> Next to genetic factors, "obesogenic" environments that facilitate a sedentary lifestyle and consumption of unhealthy foods might drive the rising prevalence of overweight. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> Studies into socio-ecological determinants of overweight therefore focus on built environments, including (un)healthy residential neighborhood characteristics. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> That is, people likely engage in less physical activity in neighborhoods that are unsuitable for walking, which poses a risk for high BMI. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> Similarly, ease of access to stores and restaurants with high calorie meals can lead to increased consumption of unhealthy foods and subsequent weight gain. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> While there is some evidence linking the physical activity environment, particularly walkability, to weight, most studies on the built environment and weight-related outcomes have thus far found limited evidence. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> For the food environment, the strongest evidence was found for fast-food outlet exposure, although even within this domain findings remain inconclusive. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> Associations might differ across the degree of neighborhood deprivation, with increased exposure to fast-food outlets only linked to BMI in more deprived areas. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> Individual differences in genetic predisposition for overweight might be another influence on who remains lean and who gains weight in an obesogenic environment. However, only limited G×E research exists on the role of the wider food and physical activity environments that shape individual behaviors. Studies in adults suggest that genetic factors influence susceptibility to obesogenic neighborhood characteristics, with stronger genetic influence in more deprived neighborhoods, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> in less walkable neighborhoods, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> and in neighborhoods with more fast-food outlets. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> However, much of this research has relied on twin designs rather than genotype information to estimate genetic influence. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> In contrast to studies using twin samples, molecular genetic designs directly measure genetic risk and analyses can be conducted in any genotyped sample. By applying a G×E framework, we can elucidate which features of the neighborhood environment interact with genetic risk to influence overweight. An understanding of which genetic and built environment risk factors are associated with higher BMI can contribute to interventions that support young people in developing healthy dietary and lifestyle habits and might also inform policy responses or neighborhood-level interventions.</p><p>Longitudinal studies that explore the interplay between genes and environment on BMI in adolescence and across the transition into young adulthood are currently lacking. This is a problem because genetic factors associated with BMI increasingly influence weight during adolescence and beyond, 4 reflecting young people's growing autonomy to select and create environments in line with their genetic predispositions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> In other words, a developmental approach is necessary to study how genes and the built environment interact to shape BMI during this transition.</p><p>We used a polygenic score for BMI to examine BMI development across changes in the built environment during the transition into young adulthood and to explore genetic moderation.</p><p>A polygenic score represents an individual's genetic predisposition for a phenotype, derived from relevant genome-wide association study data. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> We used longitudinal data spanning nine years from a large-scale cohort and objective environmental measurements. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> We hypothesized that individuals moving to more fast-food dense and less walkable neighborhoods increase more in BMI and that that these associations are particularly strong for those at high genetic risk for overweight. We controlled for age, sex, family socioeconomic status, mental health, and whether participants still lived at home as these might influence BMI development. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> Additionally, we controlled for neighborhood socioeconomic status and urban density to isolate the influence of fast-food restaurant density and walkability on BMI development independent of broader socioeconomic and urban contextual factors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>We used data from six waves of the TRacking Adolescents' Individual Lives Survey (TRAILS), an ongoing longitudinal study of Dutch adolescents recruited in the north of the Netherlands with bi-or triennial follow-up assessments. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> TRAILS consists of a population and high-risk sample: The population sample was recruited through community registers and primary schools, whereby out of 2395 children approach for enrolment, 2229 (50.8% girls) agreed to participate. Data collection for the initial assessment wave (T1) took place in 2001 and 2002 (mean age 11.1), the second wave (T2) in 2003 and 2004 (mean age 13.6), the third wave (T3) in 2006 and 2007 (mean age 16.3), the fourth wave (T4) in 2008 to 2010 (mean age 19.1), the fifth wave (T5) was conducted in 2012 and 2013 (mean age 22.3), and the sixth wave (T6) took place in 2016 (mean age 25.7). The high-risk sample was set up in 2004 and included 543 children selected on the basis of having been in contact with mental health services before age 11, indicating a higher risk of mental health problems (response rate 43%). This sample included more boys (66%), in line with sex ratios for the most common childhood psychopathologies. Initial data collection occurred in 2004-2005 (mean age 10.9), with follow-up assessments every two or three years, lagging approximately one assessment wave behind the population sample: T2 in 2006-2007 (mean age 13.0), T3 in 2009-2011 (mean age 15.9), T4 in 2012-2014 (mean age 19.1), and T5 in 2015-2017 (mean age 22.0).</p><p>Retention rates ranged between 73% and 96% for the population sample and between 73% and 85% for the high-risk sample. Ethics approval was obtained from the Dutch Central Committee on Research Involving Human Subjects before the start and written consent was obtained from participants and parents. See Appendix A for attrition analyses for the data used here.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Linkage</head><p>We linked TRAILS participants' data from ages 16, 19, and 25 (corresponding to the years 2006, 2010, and 2016) to built environment data collected by the Geoscience and Health Cohort Consortium. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> We selected these time points to align BMI measurements with periods when built environmental data were available, focusing on the developmental phase when participants transitioned from living with their parents to living independently. When built environment data were not available for one or more of these time points, we obtained the data for the closest available year to our intended timeframe. We matched built environment variables to the TRAILS assessment wave conducted either in the same year or in the closest corresponding year. Given that the high-risk sample lagged behind by one assessment wave compared to the population sample, the specific TRAILS assessment wave to which the built environment data was linked differed between the two samples. Built environment data were matched with participants' residential addresses (i.e., six-digit postal code and house number), six-digit postal codes, or four-digit postal codes, depending on the available spatial scale of the built environment variables. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">1</ref> provides an overview of the included built environment data and corresponding TRAILS waves. Information on the TRAILS waves that were used to construct the variables for each time point is reported in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">2</ref>. In line with prior research conducted in the Netherlands, exposures on address level were calculated within circular buffers of 1000m around participants' homes. 21</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Body Mass Index</head><p>Weight and height were measured by trained research assistants at T2-T5 using a calibrated scale (Seca 770, Hamburg, Germany) and a stadiometer (Seca 214, Hamburg, Germany). At T6, weight and height were self-reported. BMI was calculated by dividing weight by height squared (kg/m 2 ). To address the time lag of one assessment wave in the high-risk sample compared to the population sample, we created BMI variables based on assessment year (2006, 2010, and 2016) rather than assessment wave, corresponding to BMI at ages 16, 19, and 25, respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Change in Fast-Food Restaurant Density</head><p>Data for fast-food restaurant density came from Locatus, a Dutch company that collects information on the locations and types of retailers in Europe. We used Locatus data on the kernel density of fast-food restaurants within a 1000m radius of each residential address for the years 2006, 2010, and 2016. Kernel densities are used to create a weighted availability or intensity measure in which the distances to all food retailers within the search radius are reflected for every (virtual) grid cell location. The application of kernel density estimation implies the attribution of location specific density values to the address locations of individuals with e.g., higher density values close to food retailers clustered together. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> To assess changes in fast-food restaurant density between two time points, we computed difference scores by subtracting each time point's score from the previous one, resulting in two difference scores: one reflecting fast-food restaurant density differences between 2006 (age 16) and 2010 (age 19), and the other between 2010 (age 19) and 2016 (age 25). Positive scores indicate an increase in fast-food restaurant density between time points.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Change in Walkability</head><p>The walkability index was based on seven different spatial components, including population density, density of retail and service destinations, land-use mix, street connectivity, green space, sidewalk surface area, and public transport density. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">29</ref> All components were summed and normalized to a continuous walkability index ranging from 0-100, with higher scores indicating greater walkability.</p><p>The index was not available for 2016, so we included the indices for the years 2006, 2010, and 2015. We measured changes in walkability over time by computing two difference score variables: one capturing walkability differences between 2006 (age 16) and 2010 (age 19), and the other between 2010 (age 19) and 2015 (age 25). Positive scores reflect an increase in walkability between two time points.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Polygenic Score for BMI</head><p>Genetic data were available for n=1676 participants. Details on DNA extraction and participant exclusion are provided in Appendix B. The polygenic score for BMI was computed using summary statistics of adult BMI from the Genetic Investigation of Anthropometric Traits Consortium (N=~700 000). <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">30</ref> Adult-derived polygenic scores for BMI can predict BMI during adolescence with similar accuracy to BMI in adults. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> Additionally, genome-wide association studies based on adult BMI involve much larger sample sizes compared to those focusing on child BMI, thus providing more robust estimates of genetic risk. TRAILS data were excluded from the summary statistics using R package MetaSubtract (version 1.60). <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">31</ref> We used LDpred2-auto to calculate the polygenic score, which automatically estimates the single nucleotide polymorphism-heritability (h 2 ) and the proportion of causal variants (p) without the need for a validation dataset. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">32</ref> Only HapMap3+ variants were included (n=920 337), which passed rigorous quality control and provide a good coverage of the whole genome. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">32</ref> We used the linkage disequilibrium reference panel based on European individuals of the UK Biobank provided by the developers of LDpred2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Covariates</head><p>We controlled for age at baseline, sex, cohort, family socioeconomic status, living situation, baseline mental health, neighborhood socioeconomic status, and urban density.</p><p>Family socioeconomic status was measured at T1 using both parents' educational and occupational levels and family income. Educational level was assessed in five categories ranging from elementary to university education. Occupational level was based on the International Standard Classification for Occupation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">33</ref> Family net income was measured on a scale ranging from 1 (&lt;€680 per month) to 9 (&gt;€3857 per month). Socioeconomic status was calculated as the mean of these standardized five items (Cronbach a=.84). We created variables </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analytic Strategy</head><p>We specified a latent growth model of BMI without covariates using Mplus v8.6. We Next, we first tested for main environmental effects by entering the fast-food restaurant density difference scores (Model 1a) and the walkability difference scores (Model 2a) as timevarying covariates to predict BMI change. Second, the polygenic score for BMI as well as interaction terms between the BMI polygenic score and fast-food restaurant density difference scores (Model 1b) and walkability difference scores (Model 2b) were added as predictors of slope to test for gene-environment interaction. All models were adjusted for sex, age at baseline, cohort, family socioeconomic status, and baseline mental health as time-invariant covariates, and living situation, neighborhood socioeconomic status, and urban density as time-varying covariates. Only time-invariant covariates and time-varying covariates measured at baseline were added as predictors of intercept. In models that included the polygenic score, we added 20 principal components of the genetic data to control for population stratification. All predictors were standardized to improve interpretability. Missing values were handled using multiple imputation, resulting in a final analytic sample of N=2735 for analyses excluding the polygenic score for BMI, and n=1676 for analyses including the polygenic score. Using SPSS (version 28.0.0.0), we generated twenty datasets with fifty iterations using the Fully Conditional Specification Method (Predictive Mean Matching). Analyses were conducted in the imputed datasets in Mplus and pooled estimates are reported. As a sensitivity check, we repeated the analyses using 500m and 1500m buffers for fast-food restaurant density, and 500m and 1650m buffers for walkability. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">35</ref> Variations in buffer sizes were due to differences in availability.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">2</ref> contains descriptive statistics for the full sample (N=2735) and for participants with genetic data (n=1676). The BMI polygenic score explained up to 13.0% of BMI variance in TRAILS participants. Compared to those without genetic data, participants with genetic data available were older at baseline (t2247=-2.04, P=.04, Cohen's d=-0.10), had higher family socioeconomic status (t2689=11.16, P&lt;.001, Cohen's d=0.44), resided in higher socioeconomic status neighborhoods at ages 16 (t2194=3.19, P=.001, Cohen's d=0.15) and 19 (t2255=2.04, P=.04, Cohen's d=0.09), lived in more rural areas at age 16 (t2179=-2.06, P=.04, Cohen's d=-0.10), and in more urban areas at age 25 (t1865=2.46, P=.01, Cohen's d=0.13). Correlations are presented in Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Latent Growth Analyses of BMI</head><p>Model fit indices for the latent growth analyses of BMI can be found in Supplementary Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">1</ref>. We first fitted an intercept-only model to establish baseline fit. Subsequently, we estimated a model with linear slope. The model comparison showed that adding a linear slope improved the fit over the intercept-only model (Δχ 2 3=1846.53, P&lt;.001), and the linear model generally demonstrated reasonable fit to the data (AIC=40543.06, CFI=0.96, TLI=0.87, RMSEA=.17, and SRMR=.05). <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">36</ref> Table <ref type="table">3</ref> shows parameter estimates of the linear model, and a plot depicting the predicted trajectory of BMI is included in Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Genetic Risk and Gene-Environment Interactions as Predictors of BMI Change</head><p>Genetic risk for higher BMI was a moderate predictor of BMI at age 16 (e.g., β=0.31, 95% CI: 0.27 to 0.35; Table <ref type="table">4</ref>, Model 1b). When converted back to the original BMI scale, this indicated that a one standard deviation increase in the polygenic score for BMI was associated with a 1.10 kg/m 2 higher BMI at age 16. This association became stronger over time (β=0.12, 95% CI: 0.07 to 0.18; Table <ref type="table">4</ref>, Model 1b, and β=0.11, 95% CI: 0.06 to 0.17; Table <ref type="table">5</ref>, Model 2b), indicating that for each standard deviation increase in genetic risk, the annual rate of change in BMI was, on average, 0.04 kg/m 2 higher. Genetic risk did not moderate the influence of moving to more fast-food dense or more walkable neighborhoods on BMI change (Models 1b and 2b). Sensitivity analyses produced results consistent with the main analyses (Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">S2-S5</ref>), and analyses based on complete cases showed highly similar results to those obtained from the imputed data (Tables <ref type="table">S6-S7</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>The transition from adolescence to young adulthood is an important period to study factors contributing to weight gain, as young people become more independent in making dietary and lifestyle choices. We leveraged information on adolescents' relocations during this transition to examine whether BMI development was associated with changes in the environment, specifically changes in fast-food restaurant density and walkability. Further, we examined the interplay of genes and the built environment on BMI development.</p><p>There was little evidence to suggest that participants who moved to more fast-food restaurant dense neighborhoods experienced greater BMI increases than those who moved to neighborhoods with fewer fast-food restaurants. Neighborhoods with high fast-food restaurant density are likely situated in urbanized settings that provide a large variety of options for both food and physical activity, including healthier choices. In the major cities of the Netherlands, neighborhoods located in city centers not only offer access to unhealthy food but also provide extensive opportunities for various forms of exercise. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> Exclusively focusing on fast-food restaurant density might thus oversimplify the environment, which contains features that promote and discourage healthy behaviors. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">37</ref> Consistent with findings from twin studies, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> we found moderate genetic influence on BMI development that increased with age. Parents are an important environmental source of variation in BMI in childhood, yet their influence decreases during the transition into young adulthood when individuals increasingly select and create their own environments. Such choices may in part be driven by genes that influence both the decision to move to certain types of neighborhoods and BMI development, indicating gene-environment correlation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">38</ref> Although financial constraints can restrict young people's ability to actively select specific neighborhoods to live in, genetic variants that affect BMI might also shape broader life decisions, such as attending college or choosing to remain in the parental home.</p><p>Overall, genetic risk did not appear to alter the association between changes in fast-food restaurant density and BMI change, although G×E has been reported previously. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> Interestingly, a study that investigated both cross-sectional and longitudinal associations found a stronger association between fast-food restaurant exposure and BMI, but not BMI change, in young adults with higher genetic risk. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> This suggests that interactions between genetic factors and the built environment might not be stable over time.</p><p>Similar to the results for fast-food restaurant density, we found little evidence that moving to less walkable neighborhoods was associated with greater BMI increases compared to moving to more walkable areas. This contradicts previous research on longitudinal associations between neighborhood walkability and weight-related outcomes that suggested that living in walkable neighborhoods might protect against weight gain by encouraging physical activity. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">39</ref> We also found limited support for the hypothesis that the association between moving to less walkable areas and BMI increase was stronger among individuals with higher genetic risk. Although some previous research suggests that individuals with higher genetic risk might be more sensitive to exposure to obesogenic environments, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> these studies used crosssectional designs and may only provide snapshots of the associations. Moreover, most of these studies relied on twins to examine G×E. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> The discrepancy between findings from twin-and polygenic score studies emphasizes the need for diverse approaches to examine geneenvironment interplay associated with BMI development.</p><p>Taken together, our findings indicate that associations between the built environment and the development of overweight are likely small. However, even small effects can be relevant for population health when many people are exposed. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">40</ref> The importance of the neighborhood environment could also vary across life stages, with individual-level factors, such as parenting practices and individual routines, playing a more pronounced role during the transition into young adulthood. Future studies may benefit from assessing the choices individuals make within their neighborhoods and the reasons behind these choices.</p><p>Understanding where young people choose to eat, whether they use nearby sports facilities, and their engagement in other lifestyle behaviors can provide a more nuanced representation of the association between the built environment and weight.</p><p>Despite strengths such as the longitudinal data, the use of a polygenic score for BMI, and objective measurements of the built environment, there were some limitations. First, environmental data were not available for all TRAILS assessment waves, limiting our analysis to three time points aligned with the available environmental data. Second, weight and height were self-reported at wave six. Given that individuals tend to underestimate their weight, the reliance on self-reports may have biased our results. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">41</ref> However, at wave five, both self-reports and objective measurements were collected and the high correlation of .95 between the two indicated only a minimal discrepancy. Third, genetic data were not available for the full sample, which reduced the sample size and statistical power for analyses involving the BMI polygenic score, particularly for the G×E analyses, which typically require large samples. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">42</ref> Additionally, participants with genetic data had higher socioeconomic status than participants without, which might have led to an attenuation of reported estimates. Fourth, measures of the built environment were based on where participants lived but ignored where they spent their time.</p><p>For example, patterns may be more pronounced when examining the built environment surrounding schools or workplaces. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">43</ref> Fifth, the modifiable aggregation of geographical units can introduce bias. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">44</ref> To reduce the impact of arbitrary spatial aggregation, we assessed built environment exposures within buffers around participants' homes rather than aggregating data into areas such as postal code zones. We also conducted sensitivity analyses using other buffer sizes and found no impact on the results. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">35</ref> A final limitation is the potential for bidirectional influence, where changes in BMI could also impact built environmental factors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>We examined how changes in the built environment, specifically changes in fast-food restaurant density and walkability, in interplay with genetic risk influenced BMI development during the transition to young adulthood. Changes in fast-food restaurant density or walkability did not show a clear association with BMI development, nor did genetic risk moderate responses to changes in the built environment. Only genetic risk was moderately associated with increases in BMI. Overall, our findings suggest that the development of overweight during the transition into young adulthood is influenced by genetic factors, but we did not find convincing evidence for an influence of "obesogenic" neighborhoods. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>representing living situation (1=living away from home and 2=living in family home) for 2006 (age 16), 2010 (age 19), and 2016 (age 25) based on whether participants' addresses matched those of their parents.
