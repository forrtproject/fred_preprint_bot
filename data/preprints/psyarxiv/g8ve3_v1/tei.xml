Like what does that do other than discourage students and make them feel dumb?" -Alice, a college physics student <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Le, 2022)</ref> Today's college students are grappling with a mental health crisis, as evidenced by the growing prevalence of depression, anxiety, and other forms of psychological distress over the past 15 years <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Duffy et al., 2019)</ref>. This has led to a surge in treatment-seeking behavior on campuses <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Lipson et al., 2019)</ref> and the need for educational institutions to focus on alleviating student distress. In this work, we explore how perceptions that one's classmates, teaching assistants, and instructors believe intelligence to be fixed versus malleable (i.e., perceived classroom mindset beliefs) represents both an antecedent and consequence of psychological distress among college students. Notably, this work uniquely explores the temporal dynamics of this relationship, demonstrating for the first time that perceived classroom-level fixed mindset beliefs and psychological distress may mutually reinforce each other in the classroom.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Student-Level Mindset Beliefs and Psychological Distress</head><p>College students' beliefs about the fixed (vs. malleable) nature of their own traits, such as their intelligence, may worsen mental health issues, especially when students encounter adversity <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Yeager &amp; Dweck, 2023)</ref>. Two recent meta-analyses have shown that endorsing fixed mindset beliefs, or believing that human traits are mostly stable and unchangeable, is linked to increased psychological distress (e.g., anxiety, depression, and stress), whereas embracing growth mindset beliefs, or believing that human traits can be developed through hard work, persistence, and seeking help from others, is linked to psychological well-being <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Burnette et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Schleider et al., 2015)</ref>. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> When students hold fixed mindset beliefs, experiencing setbacks, such as earning a poor test grade or receiving critical feedback from an instructor, can be paralyzing. For these students, failure in the classroom is often attributed to a lack of inherent ability, leading to a sense of hopelessness and perceived inability to overcome their academic challenges <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Seo et al., 2022)</ref>. This in turn fuels psychological distress <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Liu et al., 2015)</ref>. In contrast, students with a growth mindset are less bothered by setbacks because, instead of seeing setbacks as evidence of a permanent inadequacy, they view them as chances to enhance their skills <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Yeager &amp; Dweck, 2023)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Classroom-Level Mindset Beliefs and Psychological Distress</head><p>The relationship between mindset and psychological distress in the classroom is not simply a matter of individual beliefs. The mindset culture in a classroom can affect student distress too. Mindset cultures are reflected in a classroom's collective norms, values, policies, and practices <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Murphy &amp; Dweck, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Murphy &amp; Reeves, 2019)</ref>, and they are created and sustained by various actors in the classroom environment, such as instructors, teaching assistants, and even peers <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Muenks et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Muenks &amp; Yan, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Yeager et al., 2019</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Yeager et al., , 2022))</ref>. In a fixed-mindset classroom culture the emphasis is on celebrating talent and brilliance, and distinguishing between students who supposedly possess these qualities from those who do not, leading to limited constructive feedback from instructors or peers because it is presumed that certain students lack the potential to improve <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Kroeper, Fried, et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Kroeper, Muenks, et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Rissanen et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Sun, 2019)</ref>. In a growth mindset classroom culture, however, it is emphasized that traits are malleable, and students will improve as long as they put in effort, experiment with new strategies, and seek help when struggling. In such a culture, persistence and hard work are valued, and feedback plays a crucial role in improvement. As a result, numerous opportunities to receive constructive feedback from instructors and peers are offered to students. 2   Recent research in educational contexts has demonstrated that fixed mindset classroom cultures can worsen psychological distress (e.g., increasing negative affect and imposter feelings), 3 whereas growth mindset cultures can provide psychological strength for studentseven after accounting for students' own self-reported mindset beliefs (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Canning et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">LaCosse et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr">Muenks et al., 2020)</ref>. Consequently, growth mindset cultures tend to foster academic motivation and achievement, whereas fixed mindset cultures impede them (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Canning et al., 2019</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Canning et al., , 2022;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Yeager et al., 2022)</ref>. A longitudinal field study by <ref type="bibr">Muenks et al. (2020)</ref> examined mindset perceptions and psychological distress among college students using an experience sampling method. They found that when students perceived their professors to endorse fixed (vs. growth) mindset beliefs, students experienced greater psychological distress, such as lower belonging, increased evaluative concerns and imposter feelings, and heightened negative affect. This, in turn, predicted lower course engagement, including reduced class attendance, greater drop-out intentions, and lower grades (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Yeager et al., 2019</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Yeager et al., , 2022))</ref>.</p><p>Simply put, when students perceive that opportunities for growth are limited, they may feel hopeless, which is known to prompt psychological distress <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Abramson et al., 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Liu et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>2 Here, we refer to mindset cultures as "fixed" or "growth" for brevity, but it is crucial to note that these cultures exist on a continuum, ranging from highly growth-oriented classroom cultures to highly fixed-oriented ones, similar to the continuum of student-level mindset beliefs <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Murphy &amp; Reeves, 2019)</ref>. 3 We use the term "psychological distress" to refer to what was previously called "psychological vulnerability." This deliberate change emphasizes distress as a negative outcome in its own right, rather than solely a risk factor for other negative outcomes, like poor grades and retention.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reinforcing Recursive Processes: The Mindset-Distress Cycle</head><p>So far, we have argued that perceived classroom mindset beliefs can lead to psychological distress and a considerable literature supports this conclusion (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Canning et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">LaCosse et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr">Muenks et al., 2020)</ref>. We extend this reasoning, however, with a novel argument that this relationship is recursive: not only does perceiving a fixed mindset classroom culture lead to psychological distress, but psychological distress leads to perceiving the classroom culture to be fixed-minded.</p><p>The potential for psychological distress to shape perceptions of the classroom mindset culture can be understood as arising from two common cognitive responses to distress: enhanced threat detection and overgeneralization. First, when experiencing distress, people become more attuned to potential threats in their environment (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bar-Haim et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Cisler &amp; Koster, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">MacLeod et al., 2019)</ref>. For distressed students, this heightened sensitivity may lead to a greater awareness of fixed mindset cues that threaten their sense of competence in the classroom, such as overhearing a peer boast, "I aced that test without even studying-physics just comes naturally to me" <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Muenks &amp; Yan, 2023)</ref>. In contrast, less distressed students may not as readily detect fixed mindset cues, perhaps perceiving more growth mindset cues or a more balanced mix of both.</p><p>Second, people experiencing distress tend to engage in negative thinking patterns <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Beck, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Shickel et al., 2020)</ref>, such as overgeneralization and absolutist "all-or-nothing" thinking <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Al-Mosaiwi &amp; Johnstone, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Antoniou et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Yeager &amp; Dweck, 2023)</ref>. Thus, once a few fixed-mindset cues are detected, there's a possibility that distressed students might generalize them into a broader perception of a fixed-minded culture (e.g., "Everyone here is trying to figure</p><p>out who has what it takes and who doesn't"), fomenting feelings of hopelessness and reinforcing the distress. Less distressed students, in contrast, may be more likely to resist the inclination to form quick judgments about the mindset culture based on limited observations, preferring more data or drawing more nuanced conclusions about the classroom mindset culture.</p><p>This creates a mindset-distress cycle that can trap distressed students: perceptions of a fixed mindset culture beget distress, which in turn reinforces the perception of a fixed-minded culture. By exploring this recursive relationship, our study offers a more nuanced, comprehensive understanding of the mutually reinforcing dynamics of classroom mindset beliefs and psychological distress than previous research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Current Study</head><p>We investigate the recursive relationship between perceived mindset beliefs and psychological distress in the classroom. Our goal is to determine whether changes in perceived classroom mindset predict changes in psychological distress, and whether changes in psychological distress predict changes in perceived classroom mindset. By examining these recursive relationships, we aim to enhance our understanding of the complex interplay between mindset beliefs and mental distress, as well as identify potential intervention points to disrupt the mindset-distress cycle.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head><p>All procedures and measures received approval from the Institutional Review Board</p><p>(IRB) at the data collection site. This study analyzes data from a larger project on psychological distress and performance in introductory college physics; measures, procedures, and research questions were pre-registered. However, the specific analytical approach was not pre-registered.</p><p>For the full list of variables and research questions for the larger project, please see:</p><p><ref type="url" target="https://osf.io/wt3v2/?view_only=4d3bd58b6d994256a92078b8ee5726f0">https://osf.io/wt3v2/?view_only=4d3bd58b6d994256a92078b8ee5726f0</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>Over one semester, 383 undergraduate students taking a physics course at a large public research university in the Midwest consented to participate in the present research, out of 503 students enrolled in the course. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">4</ref> The consenting sample consisted of 68.9% men and 29.2%</p><p>women, with 1.8% not reporting their gender. The racial/ethnic makeup of the sample was 68.7%</p><p>White, 18.0% Asian, 5.0% Black, 3.9% Latine, 0.5% Pacific Islander, 0.2% American Indian/Alaska Native, and 3.7% not reported.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sensitivity Analysis</head><p>Our final sample size, restricted to 288 students, was determined by the number of enrolled participants who consented and provided complete data. Because we used a random intercept cross-lagged panel model (RI-CLPM) to test the hypothesized recursive relationship, we implemented a sensitivity power analysis for RI-CLPM <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Mulder, 2023)</ref>. The results indicated that this sample size provides 75% statistical power to detect cross-lagged effects as small as β = .25 at p = .05.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Classroom Context</head><p>The focal classroom was an introductory calculus-based physics course designed for undergraduate students majoring in physical sciences, mathematics, and engineering. The course consisted of three large lecture sections with 91 to 156 consenting students, led by one of two main instructors and held three times per week online via Zoom due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The course also included weekly group-work recitation sections via Zoom with 13 to 24 consenting students, led by a teaching assistant.<ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">foot_2</ref> Procedure All students enrolled in the course were invited to participate in a study exploring psychological factors affecting their academic experiences. Throughout the term, students completed weekly online surveys that included measures assessing their personal mindset beliefs, perceptions of classroom cultural mindset, and psychological distress.<ref type="foot" target="#foot_3">foot_3</ref> Attrition on primary measures was low: 97.13% completed the Week 3 survey, 96.08% completed the Week 8 survey, and 93.21% completed the Week 13 survey. However, complete covariate information (i.e., gender and ACT score) were only obtained for 82.2% participants, via university records. An overview of relevant survey questions and measurement administration details is provided in Table 1.<ref type="foot" target="#foot_4">foot_4</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Primary Measures</head><p>Perceived Classroom Mindset Beliefs refer to students' perceptions of the mindset culture in their classroom, including the perceived beliefs of their instructors, TAs, and peers <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Good et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Kroeper, Muenks, et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr">Muenks et al., 2020)</ref>. Students responded to six items that asked them to rate their perceptions of others' mindset beliefs, with higher scores indicating stronger endorsement of fixed mindset beliefs at the classroom-level. : "I often leave this physics class feeling like I am the only who doesn't understand the material well." Note. a Rated from 1 (Not at all) to 6 (Extremely). b Rated from 1 (Strongly disagree) to 6 (Strongly agree). c Rated from 1 (Not at all) to 6 (A huge amount). d Rated from 1 (Almost never true of myself) to 7 (Almost always true of myself). * Item was reverse scored.</p><p>Psychological Distress measures the negative psychological experiences that occur in the classroom <ref type="bibr">(Muenks et al., 2020)</ref>. To evaluate the level of psychological distress students experienced in their physics class, we measured their belonging, evaluative concerns, imposter feelings, negative affect, and social comparison concerns (10-items) every week. To standardize the measurements, we used the Percent of Maximum Possible (POMP) rescaling technique to transform all items to a uniform 0 to 100 scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Moeller, 2015)</ref>. We then computed the average psychological distress score for each student for each week of the term, with higher scores indicating greater psychological distress. Confirmatory factor analyses indicated a strong fit (weekly CFI ≥ .97; weekly RMSEA ≤ .11; weekly SRMR ≤ .05; see SOM). For the purposes of our model, we focused on Weeks 3, 8, and 13 to align with the frequency of the Perceived Classroom Mindset Beliefs assessments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Covariates</head><p>Student-Reported Mindset Beliefs refer to students' beliefs about the malleability or fixedness of their own physics ability. Consistent with past mindset research, we expected students who strongly endorsed fixed mindsets to report more psychological distress in the classroom (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Burnette et al., 2020)</ref>. Further, previous research has also shown that one's own mindset beliefs can influence perceptions of others' mindset beliefs (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Kroeper, Muenks, et al., 2022)</ref>. Therefore, we included student-reported mindset beliefs as a covariate in our main analysis. Toward the start of the term (Week 2), students responded to four items adapted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Dweck (1999)</ref> assessing their personal mindset beliefs about their physics ability. Higher scores represent stronger endorsement of fixed mindset beliefs. As expected, preliminary analyses revealed that student-reported mindset beliefs toward the start of the term were moderately correlated with psychological distress (r ≥ .26, p &lt; .001) and perceived mindset beliefs (r ≥ .30, p &lt; .001) in the classroom at all three time points, supporting its inclusion as a covariate.</p><p>Gender data were obtained from university records. We retained only students who were identified by university records as men or women (98.1%), dropping students whose gender was undisclosed (1.8%). We suspected that women, as members of a social group that is often marginalized and subject to negative stereotypes in the physics context (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Eaton et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Skibba, 2019)</ref>, would experience greater classroom-related psychological distress than men <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Good et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Murphy &amp; Zirkel, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Rudolph &amp; Conley, 2005)</ref> and suspect that others in the classroom endorse greater fixed (vs. growth) mindset beliefs <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Canning et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr">Good et al., 2012)</ref>. Therefore, we included gender as a covariate in our main analysis. As expected, preliminary descriptive analyses revealed that women indeed reported greater psychological distress than men across the three focal time points (MDifference ≥ 10.77, SEDifference ≤ 2.76, p &lt; .001, d ≥ 0.47). Additionally, women perceived significantly stronger fixed mindset beliefs about physics ability among others in the classroom (i.e., instructors, TAs, peers) compared to men (MDifference ≥ 0.26, SEDifference ≤ 0.13, p ≤ .050, d ≥ 0.23). We also found that women selfreported slightly stronger endorsement of fixed mindset beliefs about their own physics ability toward the start of the term (M = 2.37, SD = 0.89) compared to men (M = 2.12, SD = 0.90, p = .006, d = 0.28). Taken together, these findings justify the inclusion of gender as a covariate in our main analysis. 8</p><p>ACT scores were obtained from university records and included as a covariate in our main analysis to control for pre-course academic performance. The ACT is a standardized test that measures college readiness in English, math, reading, and science, with scores ranging from 8 Exploratory analyses examining moderation by gender and prior academic achievement can be found in the SOM. No significant moderation effects were found for either.</p><p>14 to 36 in this sample. We suspected that students with lower ACT scores would be more vulnerable to psychological distress in the physics classroom. Indeed, preliminary analyses revealed negative correlations between ACT scores and classroom psychological distress at all three time points (r ≤ -.17, p ≤ .004), indicating that students with lower ACT scores experienced greater distress. These findings support the inclusion of ACT scores as a covariate in our analysis.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>We were interested in understanding the recursive, longitudinal relationship between perceived mindset beliefs and psychological distress in the classroom.</p><p>We first analyzed descriptive statistics (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>). In line with past research (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Muenks et al., 2021)</ref>, students perceived their physics classrooms as relatively growth-minded (i.e., M ≥ 2.03 on a 6-point scale). However, these perceptions slightly shifted towards a fixed mindset over the course of the term, t(350) = -2.80, p = .005, d = 0.15, 95% CI [0.04, 0.25].</p><p>Students also reported relatively low levels of psychological distress,<ref type="foot" target="#foot_5">foot_5</ref> but these averages increased throughout the term too, t(350) = 6.39, p &lt; .001, d = 0.34, 95% CI [0.23, 0.45].</p><p>We then examined basic correlational relationships between these variables. Consistent with past work <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(LaCosse et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr">Muenks et al., 2020)</ref>, perceived fixed classroom mindset beliefs and psychological distress were positively correlated throughout the term (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> and Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>).</p><p>Next, we used a random intercept cross-lagged panel model (RI-CLPM) with Mplus (ver.   In these models, we controlled for student-reported mindset beliefs, gender, and ACT performance. 11, 12 Only participants with complete data for all variables (N = 288) were included in the RI-CLPM. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_9">13</ref> In addition, we placed cross-wave equality constraints for the RI-CLPM, which increases the statistical power of the analyses and enhances the precision of estimates <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Orth et al., 2021)</ref>. We report estimates for the standardized effects (β)<ref type="foot" target="#foot_10">foot_10</ref> , 95% CIs for β, and p values.</p><p>The overall fit for the RI-CLPM model was good, χ 2 (20) = 20.47, p = .429, Comparative Fit Index (CFI) = 1.00, Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) = 0.01. The autoregressive effects were positive and significant for both perceived classroom mindset beliefs and psychological distress (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>). That is, changes in perceived classroom mindset beliefs at Week 3 were positively associated with changes in perceived classroom mindset beliefs at Week 8, which were positively associated with those at Week 13 (ps ≤ .013). The same pattern was shown for psychological distress (ps &lt; .001, see SOM for the full results).</p><p>More importantly, we found significant cross-lagged effects, indicating that perceived classroom mindset beliefs and psychological distress had bidirectional effects over time.</p><p>Specifically, perceiving other individuals in the classroom as endorsing more fixed mindset beliefs predicted increased psychological distress at the next time point (Week 3 to 8: β = .18, 95% CI [.05, .31], p = .009), and, in turn, increased psychological distress predicted perceiving others as endorsing more fixed mindset beliefs (Week 8 to 13: β = .39, 95% CI [.15, .63], p = .002). This pattern suggests the mutual reinforcement of these factors over time. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Reflecting on the urgent mental health crisis among college students, this study provides novel evidence of a feedback loop between perceived classroom-level fixed mindset beliefs and psychological distress. We found that perceiving others in the classroom as more fixed-minded predicted increased psychological distress in the classroom, which, subsequently predicted perceiving others as more fixed-minded, implying that these factors may be mutually reinforcing over time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theoretical &amp; Practical Implications</head><p>Recent research has delved into how students perceive classroom mindset cultures, focusing particularly on the role of instructor and classroom characteristics <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Good et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Kroeper, Fried, et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Kroeper, Muenks, et al., 2022)</ref>. Our study expands on this by considering the influence of student-specific factors, such as psychological distress, on these perceptions. Exploring the temporal dynamics of this relationship constitutes an important and novel contribution to this field of research. Prior studies have established that perceived classroom mindset beliefs can predict psychological distress <ref type="bibr">(Canning et al., 2019</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Canning et al., , 2022;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">LaCosse et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr">Muenks et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Yeager et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Yeager &amp; Dweck, 2023)</ref>.</p><p>However, we are the first to document the reverse: psychological distress can foment perceptions of a fixed-minded classroom culture, which in turn intensifies distress. By investigating how these factors reciprocally influence each other over time, we gain valuable insights into students' distress experiences in the classroom.</p><p>To contextualize our contribution to the mindset literature, we offer several critical clarifications. First, we recognize that personal distress is just one of many factors that shape perceived mindset beliefs (and vice versa). Specifically, we see our work as an extension of research showing that signals from teachers and peers, such as their messages and behaviors, inform mindset perceptions (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Kroeper, Fried, et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Muenks et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Yeager et al., 2019)</ref>. Rather than being mere figments of distressed imaginations, we suggest that these mindset perceptions are grounded in reality-they are reasonable interpretations of tangible cues within the classroom environment (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Canning et al., 2019</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Canning et al., , 2022;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Muenks &amp; Yan, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Rattan et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Williams et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Yeager et al., 2022)</ref>. For instance, a teacher's casual remark, 'This topic isn't for everyone,' can signal a fixed mindset culture to students <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Kroeper, Muenks, et al., 2022)</ref>, perhaps especially to those who are already feeling distressed. As such, we interpret distressed students' acute sensitivity to such fixed mindset cues through the lens of threat-orientation, where distress heightens the awareness <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bar-Haim et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Cisler &amp; Koster, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">MacLeod et al., 2019)</ref> and perceived impact of negative stimuli (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Al-Mosaiwi &amp; Johnstone, 2018)</ref>. In other words, distressed students might spot fixed mindset cues in the classroom more readily than their non-distressed peers, and then generalize these cues into an impression that the overall culture is fixed-minded. Encountering these cues, which imply limited or undervalued growth opportunities, may lead to feelings of hopelessness and thus, deepen their distress <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Abramson et al., 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Liu et al., 2015)</ref>. While our study does not delineate the specific cognitive mechanisms involved in this mindset-distress cycle, it does lay the groundwork for future research. For instance, subsequent studies could use techniques like eyetracking to dissect how attention to fixed mindset cues is influenced by distress. Finally, it is crucial that our findings are not misinterpreted as a reason to shift blame onto students for their mindset perceptions. Instead, our research suggests one avenue to support student well-being is by creating classroom environments that minimize fixed mindset signals. This approach acknowledges the collective responsibility of students, educators, and institutions to cultivate conditions that promote growth mindset cultures on campus.</p><p>Recognizing the recursive relationship between perceived mindset beliefs and distress also raises practical considerations for mindset culture interventions. For instance, it may be the case that neither fixed mindset perceptions nor distress can be fully addressed unless they are considered together <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Walton &amp; Wilson, 2018)</ref>. If true, multipronged interventions that simultaneously reduce psychological distress and minimize fixed-mindset cues in the classroom may be optimal <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Kubzansky et al., 2023)</ref>. In classrooms where growth mindsets are already the norm, breaking the mindset-distress cycle could entail sharing evidence of the collective growth mindset beliefs among students, TAs, and instructors and, afterward, regularly assessing psychological distress to provide timely support. However, in classrooms where a fixed mindset culture prevails, emphasis could be placed on reshaping the mindset culture. This could involve collaborating with instructors (who often play a significant role in shaping classroom culture) to create growth mindset affordances in their classrooms <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Walton &amp; Yeager, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Yeager et al., 2022)</ref>. These affordances might include shifting classroom norms, values, policies, and practices to emphasize (1) everyone's ability to learn, (2) offering feedback and revision opportunities to all students, (3) supporting struggling students with additional emotional and material assistance, and (4) placing value on student learning and development <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Kroeper, Fried, et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Kroeper, Muenks, et al., 2022)</ref>. Future research should explore how to integrate these reforms effectively, alongside assessing and addressing students' psychological distress.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Strengths, Limitations &amp; Future Directions</head><p>A key strength of the present study is that it uses field data, enabling us to capture contemporaneous mindset perceptions and distress experienced by college STEM students in an actual class, repeatedly throughout an academic term. It is important to note, however, that like other correlational field studies, this research cannot definitively establish causal relations between perceived mindset beliefs and psychological distress. The observed relations may be influenced by an unmeasured third variable affecting both perceived mindset and distress.</p><p>Nevertheless, the study's longitudinal design rules out reverse causation,<ref type="foot" target="#foot_11">foot_11</ref> and by collecting data at multiple timepoints, we mitigate issues related to recollection. Despite the limitations in causal inference, field data bolsters ecological and external validity.</p><p>In our study, there were only three course sections, and most students perceived them as growth-minded, which limited the variability in perceived classroom mindset. Yet, despite this limited variability, we detected a self-defeating cycle linking perceived fixed-mindset beliefs and distress. This raises the possibility that the observed effect sizes may be underestimations and that this cycle might be even stronger in more fixed-minded classrooms. Moreover, these results suggest that, even within a generally growth-oriented environment, small shifts towards fixedness are both significant and noteworthy, as they are recursively linked to psychological distress in the classroom. Regardless, future research should seek to increase variability by recruiting a larger number of course sections and instructors.</p><p>We acknowledge that our data were collected in spring 2021, one year into the COVID-19 pandemic, during which classes and recitations were held remotely. This unconventional format might have limited students' ability to infer the mindset beliefs of their instructors, TAs, and classmates, potentially affecting the generalizability of our findings. In-person classes, which enable more direct student-instructor and student-student interaction, might foster stronger perceptions of mindset beliefs, and, consequently, create more (or less) distress. However, the specific influence of in-person versus remote classroom settings on mindset perceptions and related distress constitutes an empirical question in itself, warranting further study. Although remote classes are becoming increasingly common <ref type="bibr">(Ezarik, 2021)</ref>, and the present study carries immediate implications for these online classroom environments, we recommend that future research replicate our results in more traditional classroom settings.</p><p>The generalizability of our findings might also be constrained by our sample characteristics, namely physics students who are predominantly white and male, attending a fouryear university in the United States. Future research should explore whether these findings extend to other challenging courses and more diverse samples. The relationship between perceived classroom mindset beliefs and psychological distress could be particularly critical during middle and high school, a period when adolescents are forming foundational beliefs and are more susceptible to mental health issues <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Sisk &amp; Gee, 2022)</ref>. Or, perhaps, this recursive cycle could manifest differently cross-culturally. In cultures where negative affect is perceived as less aversive and more motivating (e.g., Eastern cultures, cultures emphasizing dialectical thinking; <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Eid &amp; Diener, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Miyamoto et al., 2014)</ref>, the linkages between perceived mindset beliefs and psychological distress may be weaker or even absent.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>The mental health crisis in college settings calls for effective interventions. The present work represents an important advance toward this end by documenting for the first time that perceiving classroom mindsets as more fixed rather than growth is both an antecedent and a consequence of psychological distress. These recursive processes may create a mindset-distress cycle that poses challenges for interventions that focus on only one or the other of these processes. By understanding the dynamics of this relationship, we hope to make progress in not only creating more supportive and inclusive learning environments, but also in alleviating psychological distress among college students.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measurement Details</head><p>We operationalized "psychological distress" using a hierarchical model with one higherorder latent factor ("psychological distress") that is indirectly measured through five lower-order latent factors ("belonging", "evaluative concerns", "imposter feelings", "negative affect", and "social comparison concerns").</p><p>Each of these lower-order latent factors is directly measured by two observed indicators:</p><p>Belonging 1: "How comfortable do you feel during this class?" Belonging 2: "How accepted do you feel during this class?" Evaluative Concerns 1: "In class, how much do you worry that your professor might think that you were a slow learner?" Evaluative Concerns 2: "In class, how much do you worry that your professor might not believe in your abilities to do well in this class?" Imposter Feelings 1: "In class, I feel afraid others will discover how much knowledge or ability I really lack." Imposter Feelings 2: "In class, I feel like people might find out that I am not as capable as they think I am." Negative Affect 1: "When I am in class, I feel distressed." Negative Affect 2: "When I am in class, I feel upset." Social Comparison Concerns 1: "I often leave this physics class feeling like I am not as smart as others." Social Comparison Concerns 2: "I often leave this physics class feeling like I am the only who doesn't understand the material well."</p><p>As reported in the main text, internal consistency reliability across the semester was strong for this 10-item measure (weekly α's ≥ .93). Additionally, confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) fit indices were good (CFIs ≥ .97; RMSEAs ≤ .11; SRMRs ≤ .05; see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">S1</ref>).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Moderation by Gender</head><p>We used multigroup analyses in Mplus <ref type="bibr">(Mulder &amp; Hamaker, 2021)</ref> to test whether gender moderates the path coefficients in the RI-CLPM. Specifically, in the analysis, we constrained the path coefficients of the autoregressive and cross-lagged effects in the RI-CLPM to be invariant across genders and compared the fit of this constrained model to the fit of the unconstrained model in which all path coefficients are allowed to vary across genders. We used the chi-square statistics to evaluate the difference in model fit. The difference in fit between the constrained model and unconstrained model was not statistically significant (Δχ 2 (4) = 5.96, p = .202), indicating that none of the autoregressive and cross-lagged effects differ between genders. Thus, the results of the RI-CLPM were consistent across men and women.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Moderation by Prior Academic Performance</head><p>We also test whether prior academic performance moderates the path coefficients in the RI-CLPM. We operationalized prior academic performance using students' ACT scores. Because multigroup analyses cannot handle a continuous moderator, we used a Bayesian Structural Equation Modelling framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Speyer et al., 2023)</ref>. Specifically, interaction terms between ACT scores and within-person changes in perceived classroom mindset beliefs and between ACT scores and within-person changes in psychological distress were included in the RI-CLPM, and a Bayesian estimator was used to estimate the parameters of the interactions. The results showed that none of the autoregressive and cross-lagged effects were moderated by ACT scores (ps ≥ .230), indicating that the results of the RI-CLPM were consistent across people with varying ACT scores.<ref type="foot" target="#foot_12">foot_12</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic Performance Outcomes</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p>Student distress is an aversive outcome that should be minimized, irrespective of its influence on grades or retention. However, prior research links teachers' mindset beliefs and student psychological distress to students' academic performance <ref type="bibr">(Canning et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">Muenks et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr">Suresh &amp; Heckler, 2023)</ref>. In this context, we investigated whether perceived fixed classroom mindset beliefs and psychological distress could predict lower final exam scores and course grades. However, given the small effects in past studies and their larger sample sizesbetween three and fifty times larger than ours-we recommend a careful interpretation of our analyses. This disparity in sample size suggests our study might lack the statistical power to detect these small effects. Nonetheless, in the interest of transparency, we have included these analyses in the SOM.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures</head><p>Final exam performance was retrieved from university records. Scores were based on 10 multiple-choice questions (worth 5 points each) and 4 open-ended, show-work questions (worth between 10 and 15 points). Final exam scores ranged from 0 to 96 points in this sample (M = 56.60, SD = 18.05).</p><p>Final grades were also retrieved from university records. These grades were based on lab (10%) and prelab work (3%), online homework (12%), hand-in homework (6%), recitation participation (6%), online practice problems (3%), quizzes (16%), midterms (24%), and the final exam (20%). On a 4.0 scale, the average final grades ranged from 0.0 to 4.0 (M = 2.73, SD = 1.05).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Our first step was to analyze bivariate correlations. The perceived classroom mindset beliefs showed no significant correlation with final exam performance at any of the three time points, although the trends aligned with our expectations (Week 3: r = -.04, p = .431; Week 8: r = -.09, p = .09; Week 13: r = -.04, p = .482). Psychological distress, on the other hand, demonstrated a significant negative correlation with final exam performance during Week 3 (r = -.20, p &lt; .001) and Week 8 (r = -.15, p = .004), while the correlation in Week 13 was negative but not significant (r = -.09, p = .115).</p><p>Regarding final grades, there was no significant correlation with perceived classroom mindset beliefs at any of the three time points (Week 3: r = .02, p = .699; Week 8: r = -.03, p = .602; Week 13: r = -.01, p = .893). Psychological distress showed a significant negative correlation with final grades in Week 3 (r = -.14, p = .006), while the correlation in Week 8 was negative but not significant (r = -.09, p = .103). By Week 13, the correlation between final grades and distress was statistically insignificant (r = -.03, p = .537).</p><p>Next, we performed regression analyses to study the impact of Week 13 perceived classroom mindset beliefs and Week 13 psychological distress on final exam scores and grades, while adjusting for student-reported mindset beliefs, gender, and ACT scores. In these analyses, the only significant predictor of both final exam scores and grades was the ACT score, with higher ACT scores predicting better outcomes (B = 0.46, p &lt; .001 for exam scores; B = 0.38, p &lt; .001 for grades). All other variables had no significant effect (ps ≥ .106; see Tables <ref type="table">S3</ref> and <ref type="table">S4</ref>). It's important to note that the estimates for psychological distress align with the trends in previous research <ref type="bibr">(Canning et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">Muenks et al., 2020)</ref>, albeit not reaching statistical significance in this study. Furthermore, these coefficients reflect the expected direction of the relationship. The absence of statistical significance might be due to our study being underpowered to detect these effects.</p><p>Table S3. Regression: Predictors on Final Exam Performance 95% CI Effect Est.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>While previous research (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Canning et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">Muenks et al., 2020)</ref> has established a connection between mindsets of others' the classroom, distress, and performance, our study provided only limited support for these relationships. In the following section, we delve into possible explanations for our study's inability to replicate these previously identified relationships.</p><p>As previously noted, our study's limited sample size may have constrained our ability to detect small effects. This challenge is further underscored when comparing our sample size with those of past studies. For instance, <ref type="bibr">Muenks et al. (2020)</ref> in their fourth study surveyed over 900 students, and <ref type="bibr">Canning et al. (2019)</ref> examined a sample exceeding 15,000 students. In contrast, our recruitment efforts yielded only 288 participants. This smaller sample could potentially introduce a higher margin of error and may not offer the same statistical power to detect small yet meaningful relationships that larger studies can capture. Hence, these discrepancies in sample size could partially explain the different findings between our study and the preceding research.</p><p>Furthermore, the limited variation in perceived classroom mindset within our study could have constrained our ability to detect significant effects on academic outcomes. Although there were relative differences in perceptions of classroom mindsets, overall most of our students perceived their course sections as endorsing a growth mindset, resulting in a more homogeneous sample. This homogeneity could limit our ability to uncover potential differences and relationships that a more diverse set of mindset perceptions might reveal. In contrast, past research has covered a broader range of classrooms, affording a more varied mindset perceptions. For instance, Muenks et al. surveyed students from 37 classrooms, while <ref type="bibr">Canning et al.</ref> extended their study to 634 classrooms. Such larger, more diverse samples are more capable of detecting subtle effects or nuanced relationships. Therefore, the limited classroom representation in our study may have contributed to our deviating findings.</p><p>Lastly, the unique circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic may also explain our inability to detect an effect on academic performance. The data for this study were collected in spring 2021, one year into the pandemic. Research suggests that during this time, instructors were more lenient towards students' poor performance <ref type="bibr">(Ezarik, 2021)</ref>. In a typical semester, when instructors adhere more stringently to classroom policies, the perceived mindset and distress of students may have a greater impact on grades.</p><p>In summary, our study diverged from previous research findings, providing only minimal evidence of the influence of classroom mindset and distress on academic performance. This discrepancy can be attributed to several factors. Our smaller sample size, compared to past studies, likely impacted our statistical power to detect minor but significant effects. Furthermore, limited variability in perceived classroom mindset beliefs in our study may have restricted our ability to uncover significant relationships. Lastly, the unprecedented circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic during our data collection period could have affected student performance and instructor leniency, thus potentially obscuring the relationships under investigation. Our findings underline the necessity for larger, more diverse studies, and highlight the impact of external factors such as global crises on educational research outcomes.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>8.8) to test recursive relationships between perceived classroom mindset beliefs and psychological distress over three time points (Week 3, 8, and 13 of the term).

The results were consistent with those using the Bayesian Structural Equation Modelling framework. Specifically, the difference in fit between the constrained model and unconstrained model was not statistically significant (Δχ 2 (4) = 3.44, p = .487), indicating that none of the autoregressive and cross-lagged effects differ between high and low ACT groups.</p></note>
