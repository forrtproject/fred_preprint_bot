<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The Model of Excellencism and Perfectionism (MEP) differentiates striving toward high and realistic standards from striving for perfectionistic standards. Two studies situated excellencism and perfectionism within the nomological network of the Perfectionism Social Disconnection Model (PSDM). Study 1 (n=284) showed that excellencism and perfectionism were distinctively associated with loneliness, social goals, self-presentation strategies, and sacrificing social and community goals. Study 2 (n=396) replicated the associations with loneliness and showed higher frustration of the need for relatedness in perfection strivers than in excellence strivers. The results emphasized the importance of distinguishing between perfectionism and excellencism to understand their unique roles in psychological and social adjustment, with perfectionism leading to social disconnection and excellencism promoting healthier relationships.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The feeling of being alone or socially disconnected is a significant risk factor for psychological maladjustment among emerging adults (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Park et al., 2020)</ref>. Over the last thirty years, both perfectionism and loneliness have significantly increased among young adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Buecker et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Curran &amp; Hill, 2019)</ref>. As young adults perceive more social pressure to be perfect <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Curran &amp; Hill, 2022)</ref>, many risk sacrificing their social relationships, viewing friendship and romance as interfering with their goals. Perfectionism is a multidimensional construct, and recent research has drawn attention to the difference between people who pursue perfection and those who strive for excellence. The nuanced perspectives in the Model of Excellencism and Perfectionism (MEP; <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Gaudreau, 2019)</ref> can further our understanding of the role of perfectionism in psychological and social adjustment. However, the distinction between excellencism and perfectionism has yet to inform theories and research on how perfectionism relates to social disconnection. We conducted two studies to deepen our understanding of perfectionism and loneliness. Study 1 investigated loneliness, social goals, and self-regulation tactics of emerging adults pursuing perfection compared to those pursuing excellence. Study 2 aimed to probe unexpected findings from Study 1 by replicating the distinct associations of perfectionism and excellencism with social connection and social disconnection indicators, including satisfaction and frustration of the need for relatedness.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1.">Perfectionism and Excellencism</head><p>The MEP introduces the concept of excellencism as a counterweight to clarify the definition of perfectionism <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Gaudreau, 2019)</ref>. People with excellencism pursue high standards in an engaged and flexible manner. Such high standards have frequently been conceptualized and measured as a facet of perfectionism (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Frost et al., 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Slaney et al., 2001)</ref>. However, perfectionism has traditionally been portrayed in a way that involves the aiming and pursuing of standards that go above and beyond the high standards involved in excellencism (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Egan et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Hewitt et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Smith et al., 2022)</ref>. Excellence is a realistic and attainable endpoint whereas perfection is a strictly unattainable standard based on the relentless pursuit of flawlessness. The MEP formalizes the distinction between the high but realistic standards involved in excellencism and the extremely high, and unrealistic perfectionistic standards involved in perfectionism <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Gaudreau, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">Gaudreau et al., 2022)</ref>. The MEP offers a conceptual framework to investigate the unique role of excellencism and perfectionism in psychological and social adjustment.</p><p>The MEP conceptualizes perfectionistic standards as the core definitional feature of perfectionism <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Gaudreau, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Gaudreau et al., 2023)</ref>. People who strive toward perfection will express their perfectionism in various ways. Perfectionism is a multidimensional construct and constitutive elements such as concerns over mistakes, doubts about actions, socially prescribed perfectionism, other-oriented perfectionism, automatic perfectionistic thoughts, and perfectionistic self-presentation tactics (for a review, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Smith et al., 2022)</ref> are reconceptualized as signature expressions of perfectionism in the MEP. These signature expressions are differential features that shape the unique phenomenological experience of being a perfectionist. Growing empirical support has supported this hypothesis (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Gaudreau et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Tape et al., 2024)</ref>. Compared to people who aim toward excellence (i.e., excellence strivers), those who aim toward perfection (i.e., perfection strivers) are more likely to experience the many signature expressions of perfectionism. Excellencism and perfection both involve the pursuit of high standards <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bien et al., 2024)</ref>, but only the stringent, rigid, and extreme perfectionistic standards seem to activate the many signature expressions of perfectionism (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Gaudreau et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Tape et al., 2024)</ref> that are closely associated with the development and maintenance of symptoms of psychopathology (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Limburg et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Excellencism and perfectionism are part of a dualistic system in which their respective effects on psychological adjustment are interpreted together rather than in isolation <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Gaudreau, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">Gaudreau et al., 2024)</ref>. Different combinations of positive, null, and negative effects of excellencism and perfectionism have been described in the nine hypothetical scenarios of the MEP <ref type="bibr">(Gaudreau et al., 2024)</ref>. To conclude that perfectionism is beneficial, perfection strivers must show better outcomes than excellence strivers. If their outcomes are comparable, it suggests perfectionism is unneeded. Perfection strivers use more resources and experience more strain to achieve the same results, indicating inefficiency and unsustainability. If perfection strivers have worse outcomes, it supports the view that perfectionism is harmful.</p><p>Empirical studies on the MEP have helped to clarify inconsistent evidence regarding the outcomes associated with perfectionistic standards. For example, past studies concluded that perfectionism can either be a booster (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Chou et al., 2019)</ref> or a creativity killer (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Ferrari &amp; Mautz, 1997)</ref>. Results of two studies using different measures of creative achievement showed that the positive effects sometimes reported in the literature were attributable to the high standards often conflated with measures of perfectionistic standards <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Goulet-Pelletier et al., 2022)</ref>. More precisely, creativity was positively associated with excellencism and negatively associated with perfectionism, hinting that perfectionism is harmful. Similar results have been found with academic achievement <ref type="bibr">(Gaudreau et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Tape et al., 2024)</ref> and various psychological adjustment constructs <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Cheek &amp; Goebel, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr">Gaudreau &amp; Schellenberg, 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr">Gaudreau et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Tape et al., 2024)</ref>. Overall, the separation between excellencism and perfectionism is a theoretical step to clarify how perfectionistic standards can contribute to psychological and social adjustment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2.">Social Disconnection in the MEP</head><p>Researchers have yet to apply the MEP to the study of social adjustment, but the idea that perfectionists are likely to experience social difficulties is a common theme in the perfectionism literature (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Hewitt et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Smith et al., 2020)</ref>. The Perfectionism Social Disconnection Model (PSDM) posits that perfectionism contributes to feelings of loneliness and social disconnection due to difficulties in forming and maintaining close relationships <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Hewitt et al., 2006)</ref>. Hostility toward others and avoidance of social situations may hinder one's capacity to create trustful, caring, and respectful social ties needed to feel socially connected and satisfied (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Flett &amp; Hewitt, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Smith et al., 2020)</ref>. In that context, asserting that perfectionists are particularly vulnerable to the burdens of social disconnection is logically defendable. Support for the presumed association between perfectionism and loneliness varies across the conceptual landscape of the perfectionism construct. Facets operationalized as signature expressions of perfectionism in the MEP (e.g., concerns over mistakes, doubts about actions, socially prescribed perfectionism, discrepancy, perfectionistic self-presentation) have systematically been positively and strongly associated with feelings of loneliness <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Smith et al., 2020)</ref>. However, studies examining the association between perfectionistic standards and loneliness have produced inconsistent results. Most studies have reported correlations between indicators of perfectionistic standards (e.g., high standards, self-oriented perfectionism) and loneliness that were small/negative <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Chang et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Chang et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Flett et al., 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Muyan &amp; Chang, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Wang et al., 2009)</ref> or a small/positive <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Chang, 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Chang, , 2017;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Dobos et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Harper et al., 2020)</ref>. Some studies even decided to exclude measures of perfectionistic standards to focus on perfectionistic concerns (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Flett et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Mackinnon et al., 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Only a few studies found a moderate positive correlation (from .17 to .27) between self-oriented perfectionism and loneliness <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Rnic et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Robinson et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Visvalingam et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Zhao et al., 2024)</ref>.</p><p>The MEP places perfectionistic standards as the core definitional feature of perfectionism. Following that, the lack of a systematic association between perfectionistic standards and loneliness contradicts the position that perfectionism is a risk factor for social disconnection. In this study, we created bridges between the MEP and the PSDM to clarify the relationship between perfectionistic standards and loneliness, which is essential to support the notion that perfectionism contributes to social disconnection. We forwarded and investigated two explanations to unravel these theoretically unexpected and contradictory findings.</p><p>On the one hand, what happens to the association between perfectionistic standards and loneliness remains to be seen once perfectionism is clearly differentiated from excellencism.</p><p>Based on the MEP, expecting a negative association between excellencism and loneliness is defendable because excellence strivers operate under a "good enough principle" that could help them invest the resources needed to develop and maintain fulfilling social relationships. Several studies relied on measures that conflated high standards (excellencism) and perfectionistic standards (perfectionism) which may have dragged down the positive association between perfectionistic standards and psychological outcomes (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Gaudreau, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Osenk et al., 2020)</ref>, such as loneliness. If we accept this rationale, then we should expect MEP studies to find a significant and positive association between perfectionism and loneliness. In other words, perfection strivers are hypothesized to exhibit higher loneliness than excellence strivers.</p><p>Separating the effect of perfectionism from excellencism will help to reevaluate whether perfectionism is socially unhealthy, unneeded, or beneficial (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Gaudreau et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr">Gaudreau et al., 2024)</ref>.</p><p>On the other hand, perfectionism has often been dubbed as a double-edged sword (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Stoeber, 2014)</ref>. In the context of social relationships, perfection strivers may be prone to pursue social goals that could be antagonistically related to social adjustment <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Ryan &amp; Shim, 2008)</ref>.</p><p>Social achievement goals offer individuals different paths to express their natural desire to satisfy their needs for social competence and relatedness <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Hirsch &amp; Clark, 2019)</ref>. Not all social achievement goals are equally associated with desirable social outcomes (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Liem, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Michou et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Mouratidis &amp; Sideridis, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Ryan &amp; Shim, 2006)</ref>. Social development goals, which focus on developing deeper connections (e.g., becoming a better friend, finding better ways to get along with people, and becoming a better listener), are generally associated with positive social outcomes like reduced loneliness (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Shim et al., 2024)</ref>. Another type of approach-oriented motivation, social demonstration goals, involves seeking social validation and being favorably judged by others. This can be pursued by hanging out with highly liked people, wanting to be perceived as popular and cool, and doing things that look good in front of others.</p><p>These goals can lead to a mix of outcomes, such as perceived popularity but also less prosocial behavior. Social demonstration avoidance goals encompass actions to shield oneself from potential embarrassment or ridicule, such as refraining from behaviors that might provoke laughter, teasing, or mockery. These avoidance goals are typically associated with negative social outcomes, including loneliness (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Shim et al., 2024)</ref>.</p><p>The epitomizing pursuit of avoidance-oriented social achievement goals shares similarities with perfectionistic self-presentation tactics. Perfection strivers try to promote themselves as being perfect while avoiding displaying and disclosing their imperfections <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Hewitt et al., 2003)</ref>. Perfectionistic self-presentation tactics are positively and strongly associated with an increased risk of social disconnection <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Smith et al., 2020)</ref> and loneliness <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Arce &amp; Polo, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Robinson et al., 2022)</ref>. Far less empirical attention has been allocated to the potential links between perfectionism and the pursuit of social achievement goals. Perfectionistic standards (measured with high standards) have been found to relate positively to each of the three social achievement goals <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Fletcher &amp; Shim, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Shim &amp; Fletcher, 2012)</ref>. It remains uncertain just how much these findings are tainted by the fact that high standards measure a mixture of excellencism and perfectionism. Within the MEP framework, excellencism should positively correlate with social development goals whereas perfectionism should positively correlate with approach and avoidance social demonstration goals. If so, the antagonistic approach and avoidance goals of perfection strivers could explain the small and inconsistent association between perfectionistic standards and loneliness in previous studies (for another illustration of the antagonistic effects of avoidance and approach motivation, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Sommet &amp; Elliot, 2023)</ref>. Such findings would be consistent with perfectionism being a double-edged sword.</p><p>Several streams of research inform us of the difficulty of finding the right balance in pursuing our goals (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Taris &amp; Jonge, 2024)</ref>. Balancing professional (e.g., school, work) with interpersonal life (e.g., friends, family, community) can be facilitated when someone aims toward realistically achievable goals. Excellence strivers follow a "good enough principle" allowing them to balance various activities. For instance, a study found that student-athletes who are excellence strivers feel less interference between school and sports compared to perfection strivers <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Gaudreau et al., 2021)</ref>. Several theorists have described perfectionism as an unreasonable and inflexible quest in which the person is prepared to sacrifice everything to achieve their goals <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Egan et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Hewitt et al., 2017)</ref>. Occasional sacrifices are ubiquitously needed to prioritize urgent and essential tasks in our daily lives. However, sacrificing one's health, relationships, and community engagement solely for personal ambitions can pose significant risks for social disconnection and loneliness (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Holding et al., 2020)</ref>. Prioritizing extrinsic (e.g., fame, glory, appearance) rather than intrinsic goals (e.g., healthy, relationships, community) is negatively associated with psychological well-being <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bradshaw et al., 2022)</ref>.</p><p>Such a tendency to sacrifice reduces a person's self-concept by putting all their eggs in one basket (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Linville, 1985)</ref>. This overspecialization of the self-concept places the person in a vulnerable situation that increases the risk of isolation and obsessive development centered on realizing a narrow, reductionist self-concept (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Vallerand, 2015)</ref>. Repeated sacrifices of social relationships and community engagement can lead to frustration with the need for relatedness, and sacrificing one's psychological needs has been associated with decreased well-being and life satisfaction (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Houlfort et al., 2022)</ref>.</p><p>Very few studies have looked at the potential links between perfectionism and the sacrifices made to pursue personal goals. Perfectionists have a bottom-line mentality <ref type="bibr">(Gaudreau &amp; Schellenberg, 2022)</ref>. They will do anything to achieve their goals to the point it could cause them harm. Drawing on the theoretical literature on perfectionism and MEP, we expected that people who pursue perfection make more significant social sacrifices (social relationships, community engagement) than people who pursue excellence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Study 1</head><p>We aimed to deepen our understanding of loneliness by differentiating the social goals, sacrifices, and self-presentation of emerging adults who pursue perfection versus excellence. We expected perfection strivers to rely on perfectionistic self-presentation tactics and to make social sacrifices (e.g., interpersonal and community) to a larger extent than excellence strivers. We also explored the idea that perfectionism is tied to an antagonistic pursuit of social achievement goals that are associated with desirable and undesirable social outcomes. While social demonstration goals could help perfection strivers expand their networks, they may lack the deep, reciprocal bonds needed to fully satisfy the need for affiliation in a healthy and lasting way <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Baumeister &amp; Leary, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bradshaw et al., 2022)</ref>. Nevertheless, these goals potentially enable perfectionists to maintain enough social relationships to reduce feelings of loneliness. Simultaneously, social avoidance goals can be appealing to perfection strivers to shield themselves from embarrassing social blunders. Much like the tactics to avoid displaying and disclosing one's imperfection, these avoidance goals can exacerbate social anxiety and increase feelings of loneliness (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Hewitt et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Hofmann, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Knoll et al., 2019)</ref>. Overall, excellence and perfection strivers are expected to differ on social achievement goals, willingness to sacrifice their social relationships, and perfectionistic self-presentation strategies, which could explain their respective likelihood of experiencing lower and higher levels of loneliness.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Method</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.1.">Participants</head><p>A sample of 300 university students from Canada, USA, and UK completed an online questionnaire and were recruited via the Prolific Academic platform in January 2023. This sample size is in line with the previous research using the MEP and is sufficient to detect the effect of personality on proximal outcomes using regression models. After removing 11 participants who failed the attention check, and five univariate outliers, the final sample consisted of 284 students between 18 and 30 years of age (mean = 22.56, SD = 3.29). The sample comprises 150 men, 127 women, and 7 identifying as non-binary. The participants were mostly undergraduates (n=218) and some graduate students (n=60). In the sample, 53% self-identified as White, Hispanic (5.6%), Asian (21.5%), Black (13%), Middle Eastern (1.4%), African (1%), and mixed-raced or multi-ethnic (4.5%). All participants provided their informed consent, and the study was approved by the Research Ethics Board of the (MASKED FOR REVIEW).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.2.">Measures</head><p>Excellencism and Perfectionism. Participants answered each of the 22 questions from the Scale of Perfectionism and Excellencism (SCOPE, <ref type="bibr">Gaudreau et al. 2022</ref>) on a scale from 1 (Not at all agree) to 7 (Totally agree). The SCOPE asks about striving with "As a person, my general goal in life is to…" and has a two-factor structure with subscales measuring excellencism (e.g. "attain difficult but realistic goals") and perfectionism (e.g. "accomplish great things perfectly"). The questionnaire has been validated and used in samples of students in the past <ref type="bibr">(Gaudreau et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Tape et al., 2024)</ref>. Internal consistency coefficients of the SCOPE (and all other measures used in this study) are presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>.</p><p>Perfectionistic Self-Presentation. Three ways to control self-presentation are identified in the 18-item Perfectionistic Self-Presentation Scale-Junior Form (PSPS-Jr; <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Hewitt et al., 2011)</ref>: Perfectionistic self-promotion ("I like trying to look perfect to other people"), nondisplay of imperfection ("I feel bad about myself when I make mistakes in front of other people"), and nondisclosure of imperfection ("I should always keep my problems secret"). Participants self-reported their responses on a scale from 1 (Strongly disagree) to 5 (Strongly agree). Scores for each subscale and a total composite score were calculated along with their internal reliability (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</p><p>Social Achievement Goals. The Social Achievement Goal orientations were measured using the three subscales of the 12-item questionnaire from the Social Achievement Goals <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Ryan, 2006)</ref>. The subscales are social development ("In general, I strive to develop my interpersonal skills"), social demonstration approach ("It is important to me that others think of me as popular"), and social demonstration avoidance ("I would be successful if I could avoid being socially awkward"). Participants rated statements from 1 (Not at all true of me) to 5 (Totally true of me). Internal consistency was acceptable across the three subscales (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</p><p>Social Sacrifices. We used two 5-item scales measuring meaningful relationships and community contributions from the Life Aspiration Index <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Kasser &amp; Ryan, 1993)</ref>. These items have been used to measure goal endorsement and goal attainment in past studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bradshaw et al., 2022)</ref>. In this study, we modified the instructions to evaluate the extent to which people made sacrifices in their relational (e.g., "To feel that there are people who really love me, and who I love.") and community aspirations (e.g., "To assist people who need it, asking nothing in return"). Items were preceded with this instruction: "Over the last few weeks, which of these things have you sacrificed in the pursuit of your goals?". Participants answered each item on a scale from 1 (Not at all agree) to 7 (Totally agree). Internal consistency of the scores was excellent in this sample (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Feelings of Loneliness. Feelings of Loneliness were measured with the UCLA</head><p>Loneliness Scale version 3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Russell, 1996)</ref> a 20-item questionnaire asking ("How often do you feel that there is no one you can turn to?") on a scale of 1 (Never) to 4 (Always). The third version of the questionnaire contains 9 reversed items ("How often do you feel that there are people you can talk to?") that were added to avoid systematic response bias. However, reversed items can create validity and interpretability problems, and even distort correlations with other variables (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Gehlbach, 2015)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Russell (1996)</ref> reported an effect of the negative items on the factorial structure, which had been questioned by other researchers <ref type="bibr">(Maes et al., 2022)</ref>. Results from our own factor analysis showed that a two-factor model separating positive and negative items improves significantly model fit (Δχ2=282.99, p &lt; 0.01). Therefore, we decided to analyze our data twice: once using the total score and once separating the loneliness items (i.e., social disconnection) and the reversed items (i.e., social connection). Internal consistency was excellent for all scores.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.3.">Plan of Analyses</head><p>Regression models were tested using Mplus Version 8.7 following the 7-step plan of analyses that accompanies the MEP <ref type="bibr">(Gaudreau et al., 2024)</ref>. The two predictors (i.e., excellencism and perfectionism) were mean-centered. Four multivariate multiple regressions were performed on (1) perfectionistic self-presentation tactics, (2) social achievement goals, (3) social sacrifices, and (4) loneliness. Predicted values of the dependent variables were calculated at +/-1SD from the mean of excellencism and perfectionism, and they were graphed to visually represent nonexcellence/nonperfection strivers (low excellencism and low perfectionism), excellence strivers (high excellencism and low perfectionism), and perfection strivers (high excellencism and high perfectionism). All figures were created using the publicly available MEP Shiny App: <ref type="url" target="https://model-of-excellencism-and">https://model-of-excellencism-and</ref> perfectionism.shinyapps.io/Shiny_Version2/ Loneliness. Results of our regression analysis showed that excellencism was significantly associated with lower levels of loneliness (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>, Model 1a). However, the association between perfectionism and loneliness was not statistically significant. As shown in Panel A of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, loneliness was lower in excellence strivers compared to nonexcellence/nonperfection strivers whereas excellence and perfection strivers reported comparable loneliness. The effect size of the differences between the predicted values is reported in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Results</head><p>Concerns have been raised about the fact that loneliness and reversed items (social connection) are distinct constructs that tend to have their own nomological network (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Dueber et al., 2022)</ref>. We separated loneliness and reversed items into separate dependent variables:</p><p>social disconnection and social connection respectively. Results showed that perfectionism is significantly and positively associated with loneliness (social disconnection) and that the effect was diluted due to the null association with social connection (see Model 1b in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>). These differential effects are not present in excellencism which is significantly associated with more social connection and less disconnection. Social disconnection (i.e., loneliness) was higher in perfection strivers than excellence strivers, while social connection did not significantly differ (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, Panel B). Overall, these results outlined the need to draw a clear distinction between loneliness and social connection when testing the hypothesis from the MEP and PSDM.</p><p>Perfectionistic Self-Presentation. The total score of perfectionistic self-presentation tactics was significantly and positively predicted by perfectionism and negatively associated with excellencism (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>, Model 2a). These findings indicated that perfection strivers relied on more perfectionistic self-presentation than excellence strivers who used these tactics to a lesser extent than nonexcellence/nonperfection strivers (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, Panel A). All three subscales were significantly associated with perfectionism, but the strongest association was for perfectionistic self-promotion (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>, Model 2b).</p><p>Social and Community Sacrifices. The results were similar across the two types of sacrifices (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>, Model 3). Sacrificing interpersonal relationships and community engagement were positively and significantly associated with perfectionism (but not excellencism). Perfection strivers were more likely to sacrifice their social and community lives compared to both excellence strivers and nonexcellence/nonperfection strivers (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, Panel B).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Social Achievement Goals.</head><p>The multivariate multiple regression showed nuanced effects of excellencism and perfectionism (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>, Model 4). First, perfectionism (but not excellencism) was positively associated with social demonstration goals. The same pattern emerged for the social demonstration approach and avoidance goals. Perfection strivers had higher social demonstration goals than excellence strivers, which did not significantly differ from nonexcellence/nonperfection strivers. Second, excellencism (but not perfectionism) was positively associated with social development goals. Excellence strivers had higher social development goals than nonexcellence/nonperfection strivers. Excellence and perfection strivers did not significantly differ on this goal. Overall, this pattern of effects indicated that perfection strivers have an antagonistic style of social goals in which they try to demonstrate their social competence while avoiding the display of social incompetence (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, panel C).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Brief Discussion</head><p>Perfectionism was not significantly associated with loneliness until we accounted for the conceptual distinction between feelings of social connectedness and disconnection (i.e., loneliness). Perfectionism is significantly associated with increased feelings of loneliness whereas excellencism seemed to be a protective factor with a negative association with loneliness. These contrasting findings generalized to other factors involved in the nomological network of loneliness/social disconnection. Excellencism and perfectionism differed in their associations with social goals, willingness to sacrifice social relationships and community engagement, and the desire to appear perfect in front of others. Overall, revisiting the PSDM through the lens of the MEP seems to reconcile the theories, qualitative studies, and empirical findings regarding the experience of loneliness amongst perfectionists. Still, our distinction between social connection and disconnection (i.e., loneliness) was made a posteriori and requires replication in a new sample. Note. Non = nonexcellence/nonperfection strivers.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Study 2</head><p>The difference between social connection and social disconnection was unexpected in Study 1. We aimed to replicate these findings using two approaches. First, we reverted to an older version of the UCLA loneliness scale that did not contain reversed loneliness items. In recent years, experts in scale development have recommended against the inclusion of reversed items unless a questionnaire tries to measure negatively related constructs (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Gehlbach, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Roszkowski &amp; Soven, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Weijters et al., 2013)</ref>. The loneliness scale was never intended to measure social inclusion and loneliness, and most researchers have created a unidimensional score that may have conflated two separate constructs. In Study 2, we tried to replicate our loneliness/social disconnection findings from Study 1 with a loneliness scale that would minimize the risk of contamination by items capturing the opposite of loneliness. Consistent with the social disconnection findings from Study 1, we expected to find a negative association for excellencism and a positive association for perfectionism.</p><p>Second, similar distinctions have been made between inclusion versus exclusion, belonging versus ostracism, and the satisfaction versus frustration of the need for relatedness.</p><p>According to self-determination theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Ryan &amp; Deci, 2017)</ref>, the need for relatedness is a universal and basic psychological need. When satisfied, it is hypothesized to contribute to the development and maintenance of optimal psychological functioning (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Cerasoli et al., 2016)</ref>.</p><p>However, this need can be threatened, or thwarted, and such experiences are hypothesized to contribute to the development and maintenance of psychological distress (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Vansteenkiste &amp; Ryan, 2013)</ref>. In Study 2, we relied on relatedness as a proxy of social connectedness and disconnection. We hypothesized that excellencism (but not perfectionism) would be positively associated with relatedness satisfaction. We expected that relatedness frustration would mimic the results of loneliness and be negatively associated with excellencism and positively associated with perfectionism. These findings would replicate those of Study 1 for social connection and social disconnection.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.3.">Plan of Analysis</head><p>Like Study 1, we conducted a multiple regression analysis with loneliness as the dependent variable. We also conducted a multivariate multiple regression with relatedness frustration and satisfaction as two correlated dependent variables. Loneliness.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Brief Discussion</head><p>The results of Study 2 replicated those of Study 1 by showing the importance of distinguishing social connection and disconnection. Using a loneliness measure explicitly focusing on social disconnection, our results supported the idea that perfection strivers are lonelier than excellence strivers. These effects not only replicated those of Study 1 but also generalized to the experiences of frustration with the need for relatedness. In other words, perfection strivers were more frustrated with their need for relatedness but not less satisfied than excellence strivers. As such, our findings indicate that the unhealthy effects of perfectionism on social adjustment are revealed only when we focus on feelings of social disconnection. Feelings of social connection are not significantly lower among perfection strivers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">General Discussion</head><p>Results of a recent qualitative study described perfectionism as a sad and lonely place in which perfectionists feel isolated, and out of touch with others <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Binder et al., 2023)</ref>. While such an assertion is compelling, past quantitative studies found inconsistent support for the positive association between perfectionistic standards and loneliness. We conducted the first-ever study revisiting this social disconnection hypothesis within the confines of the MEP. Our results</p><p>showed that perfectionistic standards and excellencism were respectively positively and negatively linked to loneliness. The distinction between excellencism and perfectionism is novel and clarifies the social disconnection hypothesis. Across two studies, we found that perfectionism was linked to loneliness but only when we looked at feelings of social disconnection, not social connection. In contrast, excellencism was associated with reduced social disconnection and increased social connection. The results of our study offer three possible explanations to clarify the weaker-than-expected relationship that has generally been observed in previous research. More specifically, (a) the difference between excellencism and perfectionism, (b) the difference between social disconnection and social connection, and (c) the potentially antagonistic mechanisms involved in perfectionism all need to be considered to better our understanding of the perfectionists' psychological experience of social disconnection.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>4.1.On the Difference Between Excellencism and Perfectionism</head><p>According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Gaudreau (2019)</ref>, previous studies have potentially overlooked that the effects of perfectionistic standards can differ from those associated with simply striving for high standards. Across two studies, we found support for this fundamental assumption of the MEP.</p><p>Loneliness was negatively associated with excellencism and positively associated with perfectionistic standards. Past studies sometimes found negative or null associations between loneliness and perfectionistic standards <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Arslan et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Hasnain &amp; Fatima, 2012)</ref>. These counterintuitive findings are expected if we combine excellencism and perfectionism into a single construct. Our results are informative because they indicate that excellencism is a driving force that can potentially lower social disconnection and increase social connection. Those who pursue high standards -the excellence strivers -experienced better social adjustment outcomes (i.e., social connection, satisfaction of the relatedness need) than the nonexcellence/nonperfection strivers. They also experienced less loneliness and frustration in their need for relatedness compared to perfection strivers. This is theoretically important as it indicates that high standards are not at play in the psychological experiences of social disconnection. What seems to be at play is the over-and-above effect of pursuing the extreme, unrealistic, exacting, and unattainable standards involved in perfectionism. Overall, our two studies offered the first empirical test to demonstrate the importance of separating excellencism and perfectionism to clarify the effects hypothesized in the SDMP.</p><p>In Study 1, we proposed and found evidence for the idea that perfectionism significantly relates to a propensity to make sacrifices in one's social relationships and community engagement. Sacrificing social lives to pursue personal goals can be seen as a form of inflexible over-engagement likely to contribute to the psychological experience of social disconnection.</p><p>Perfection strivers were found to be more likely to make such sacrifices than excellence strivers.</p><p>The grueling standards involved in perfectionism rather than the high standards involved in excellencism are the ones implicated in the social sacrifices. Activities within one's social and community lives are considered as intrinsic goals strongly associated with well-being and psychological adjustment <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bradshaw et al., 2022)</ref>. In our study, sacrifices correlated positively with loneliness. As such, our results contribute to an emerging line of research showing that sacrifices can harm one's psychological and social adjustment <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Houlfort et al., 2022)</ref>.</p><p>Finally, perfectionism was significantly associated with all three perfectionistic selfpresentation tactics. Excellencism was negatively associated with perfectionistic self-promotion.</p><p>which are lower in excellence strivers than nonexcellence/nonperfection strivers. On the one hand, excellence strivers are confident in their image and feel less of a need to project a perfect image than the perfection and the nonexcellence/nonperfection strivers. On the other hand, perfection strivers are more likely to conceal and mask their imperfections than excellence strivers. Often hiding one's flaws and striving to appear perfect can hinder genuine connections and accentuate feelings of social disconnection.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>4.2.On the Difference Between Social Disconnection and Connection</head><p>Past studies on the SDMP did not differentiate between social disconnection and connection, which is a second factor that could explain the somewhat inconsistent association between perfectionistic standards and loneliness. Support was found for this position across our two studies. In Study 1, we found that perfectionistic standards were not significantly associated with loneliness when the psychological experiences of social connection and disconnection were lumped into a single construct. When specifically looking at social disconnection, our results across two studies showed the expected positive association of perfectionistic standards with loneliness. Similar results were found in Study 2 when examining the need for relatedness.</p><p>Perfectionism was significantly associated with frustration with the need for relatedness (i.e., social disconnection) but not with satisfaction for the relatedness need (i.e., social connection).</p><p>The notion that perfectionism is a double-edged sword that relates to mixed feelings is part of the MEP expectations because it is a rallying theme among perfectionism scholars (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Missildine, 1963;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Stoeber, 2014)</ref>. As such, our findings highlighted the complex phenomenological experiences that differentiate perfectionism from excellencism. Perfection strivers are just as likely to feel in tune with others, part of a group, or that they have others they can talk to and turn to. No significant difference was found between the feelings of social connectedness of excellence and perfection strivers or their satisfaction with the need for relatedness. At the same time, perfection strivers feel isolated, left out, and not close to others.</p><p>Their social relationships are superficial, and they feel no one knows them well and shares the same interests and values as they do. Perfection strivers more frequently experience frustration with their need for relatedness than excellence strivers.</p><p>Perfection strivers, more than excellence strivers, feel like their lives are not up to par with their expectations <ref type="bibr">(Gaudreau et al., 2022)</ref>. This discrepancy is also a proposed mechanism involved in loneliness and social dissatisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Peplau &amp; Perlman, 1982;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Russell et al., 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Perfection strivers are potentially expecting too much out of their social relationships. Their social network is potentially composed of enough people who offer support, friendship, and love.</p><p>Yet, they tend to expect that others will be perfect, demand too much out of others, and think that others should do whatever is needed for them to live in a perfectly satisfying relationship all the time (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Hewitt &amp; Flett, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Smith et al., 2016)</ref>. What they get from social relationships creates frustration because what they expect from people is unattainable. Their perfectionism puts them on a discrepancy enlarging loop <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Carver &amp; Scheier, 1998)</ref> because of their extreme personal standards that translate and define the standards they impose onto others <ref type="bibr">(Gaudreau et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Hewitt &amp; Flett, 1991)</ref>. Their unattainable standards create frequent dissatisfaction, making them feel alone, socially disconnected, and frustrated in their need for relatedness.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>4.3.On the Antagonistic Social Goals of Perfection Strivers</head><p>The tortuous pattern of feelings socially connected and disconnected simultaneously could be reinterpreted as an approach-avoidance conflict arising from the simultaneous desire to succeed and to avoid failure <ref type="bibr">(Flett &amp; Hewitt, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr">Gaudreau et al., 2022)</ref>. The fact that perfectionism could relate to opposing motivation forces is another factor that could explain the somewhat inconsistent association between perfectionistic standards and loneliness.</p><p>In Study 1, we explored the idea that perfection strivers are motivated to seek social affiliation while being simultaneously motivated to avoid social rejection. This complex expression of social motivation was demonstrated through the unique social achievement goals espoused by perfection strivers. Both excellence and perfection strivers were motivated to develop their social relationships. However, perfection strivers additionally relied on antagonistic social demonstration goals that either do not or negatively correlate with loneliness. Perfection strivers endorsed social demonstration approach goals (e.g., wanting to be perceived as popular and cool, and letting others believe that we have many friends), which were not significantly associated with lower loneliness. Although such goals can help to expand one's social network, they are relatively superficial and may not satisfy their needs for social affiliation in a healthy and lasting way (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Baumeister &amp; Leary, 1995)</ref>. Additionally, their social demonstration avoidance goals (e.g., refraining from behaviors that might provoke laughter, teasing, or mockery from others) were strongly associated with higher loneliness. Trying to avoid social embarrassment risks placing and keeping perfectionists on the sidelines. These attempts to stay away and maintain distance from others are mechanisms for developing and maintaining social anxiety (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Hofmann, 2007)</ref>. In summary, perfectionism provides superficial and harmful forms of social goals that nullify the benefits of the social development goals derived from striving for excellence. The net sum of these positive and negative antagonistic effects on loneliness is a potential explanation that explains the weaker-than-expected association between perfectionistic standards and loneliness.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>4.4.Limitations and Future Research</head><p>Our two studies were conducted with students in post-secondary education. Our findings are limited to educated emerging adults in Western countries. Future research will need to replicate our findings across the lifespan, with adolescents and adults recruited in different countries. Perfectionism is increasing among newer generations of emerging adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Buecker et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Curran &amp; Hill, 2019)</ref> and excellencism needs to be involved to avoid underestimating the impact of this rise. Therefore, future longitudinal research, using more diversified samples, is required to pursue our understanding of the complex associations between increases in perfectionism and loneliness during adolescence and emerging adulthood while accounting for excellencism.</p><p>In this study, the role of social goals, sacrifices, and perfectionistic self-presentation in the differential feelings of loneliness of perfection and excellence strivers was only addressed theoretically and cross-sectionally. Future research should delve deeper into the developmental effects these variables could have on the relationship between perfectionism and loneliness.</p><p>Furthermore, the SDMP proposes three paths by which perfectionism influences perceptions of loneliness <ref type="bibr">(Flett &amp; Hewitt, 2022</ref>): (a) moving toward people for validation seeking, (b) moving away from people to avoid rejection, and (c) moving against people. Future research on the MEP will need to investigate the more hostile forms of social disconnection that were not studied in our studies.</p><p>Antagonistic effects observed in perfectionism could suggest that unaccounted situational variations are at play in the relationship between perfectionism and loneliness. Different social events can momentarily activate either approach or avoidance goals and self-regulation processes for people who pursue perfection. Perfection strivers would be motivated to demonstrate their social skills and values in certain situations. At other times, they would be motivated to avoid looking foolish and ridicule. These variations in situational activations of antagonistic motivations could explain the complex results of reporting both satisfaction and frustration with the need for connectedness. Future studies using the experience sampling method could clarify these antagonistic mechanisms involved in perfectionism.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusion</head><p>The MEP assumes that the difference between excellencism and perfectionism needs to be understood in the context of deeply interconnected relational and social ties <ref type="bibr">(Gaudreau et al., 2022)</ref>. A grim picture with real-life implications is starting to emerge as perfectionism and excellencism are differentially associated with distinct expressions of social disconnection. First, perfection strivers are more likely to use perfectionistic self-presentation strategies, which are known to be a questionable approach to maintaining healthy social relationships <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Casale et al., 2024)</ref>. Second, they also make important social sacrifices in their quest to pursue their unrealistic goals, which can, paradoxically, impair their satisfaction of psychological needs, social wellness, and quality of life <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Holding et al., 2020)</ref>. Third, perfection strivers are highly motivated to increase their popularity while relying on avoidance goals through which they run the risk of disconnecting themselves from the social environment. The pursuit of fame, fortune, and appearance goals <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bradshaw et al., 2022)</ref> and the efforts to avoid making social mistakes <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Shim et al., 2024)</ref> are known to be associated with lower well-being. Overall, our findings further our understanding of the different social disconnection pathways through which perfectionism and excellencism are differentially linked to psychological experiences of social disconnection.</p></div>
