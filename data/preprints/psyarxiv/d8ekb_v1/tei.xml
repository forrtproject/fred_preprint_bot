<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Vocabulary can be learned by tracking cross-situational statistics between words and aspects of the environment. Nouns and verbs -with observable referents in the environment -can be acquired rapidly, but whether more abstract morphological features can also be acquired cross-situationally, and whether such learning is affected by prior language experience, remain open questions. One hundred and seventeen adults with native languages varying in morphological richness (Chinese, English, German) were exposed to an artificial language comprising intransitive sentences with morphology indicating number, tense, and subject-verb agreement. For each sentence, two scenes appeared on a screen, and participants selected which matched the sentence. Participants learned both vocabulary and morphology from cross-situational statistics, but we found no evidence for an effect of language background. Cross-situational learning is a sufficiently powerful mechanism to drive acquisition of morphological features as well as vocabulary, and is robust to differences in morphological expression from speakers' native languages.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Learning to map sounds onto co-occurring referents in the environment poses an impressive challenge. It is often not possible to figure out the meaning of a novel word based on one scene due to the potential ambiguity of possible mappings that can be made <ref type="bibr">(Quine, 1960)</ref>. However, recent research has suggested a way to solve the problem of referential ambiguity. After being exposed to multiple scenes, learners are able to determine the mapping between the sound and its referent, by keeping track of cross-situational statistics between words and referents that regularly appear together <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Smith &amp; Yu, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Smith &amp; Yu, 2008)</ref>. To date, cross-situational learning (CSL) has been shown to be effective for vocabulary learning of words with explicit, observable referents in the environment, such as nouns <ref type="bibr">(Dal Ben et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr">Ge et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Suanda &amp; Namy, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Smith &amp; Yu, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">Vlach &amp; DeBrock, 2019)</ref>. Learning verbs has also been observed, but in far fewer studies (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Monaghan et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Scott &amp; Fisher, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr">see Roembke et al., 2013, for review)</ref>. While the learning of the word-world mapping is widely observed in CSL studies, these studies have largely focused on learning referents that can be directly observed in the environment. However, there have been a small number of studies of CSL that have investigated mappings of morphological features that express relations to more abstract, and harder to observe, properties of the environment to which the language relates. In a CSL study, <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Rebuschat et al. (2021)</ref> investigated whether morphology that marked the agent and patient of the sentences could be acquired from complex sentence-scene correspondences. In their CSL paradigm, adult participants were presented with a scene comprising two aliens interacting with one another in each learning trial, which co-occurred with hearing a transitive sentence in an artificial language that described the scene. After exposure, learning of nouns, verbs, adjectives, marker words, as well as sensitivity to word order, were then tested. They found that verbs and word order were first acquired, followed by nouns, then adjectives, and finally the morphological case markers. However, in a follow-up study, they found that the learning of the case markers was only at a chance level when referential ambiguity was increased by presenting two different scenes (one matching and one a foil) in each learning trial. The learning of case markers was also found challenging in <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Walker et al. (2020)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Monaghan et al. (2024)</ref> using similar CSL paradigms. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Finley (2023)</ref> tested the effect to which morphological cues relating to semantic categories of nouns could be acquired through CSL. In each experiment trial, participants heard a novel word with CVCV stem and CV suffix. The inflectional suffix cues were consistently mapped to semantic categories (e.g. [-ke] for fruits) in the experimental group while in the control group the inflectional cue did not carry any meanings. Along with the word, participants saw three items, one of which related to the word they heard. Results showed that the experimental group significantly outperformed the control group, indicating that the morphological cue could be rapidly acquired from CSL, and furthermore, the cue could then be used to improve learning of the stems (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Monaghan &amp; Mattock, 2012)</ref>. The beneficial effect of the morphological cues for learning, however, was only realised when referential ambiguity was initially low, enabling the role of the stem and the morpheme to be discerned. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Finley's (2023)</ref> experiment tested morphological learning in single words, and the complexity of natural language learning involves determining the role of LEARNING MORPHOLOGY FROM CROSS-SITUATIONAL STATISTICS vocabulary and morphology within longer and more complicated sentences with richer syntactic or morphological rules, and also potentially without the benefit of initial bootstrapping from lower referential ambiguity in situations to facilitate initial CSL of morphology.</p><p>However, taken together, there is evidence that, under certain circumstances, morphological markers can be acquired from crosssituational statistics. However, the question remains why these markers are more challenging to acquire than other aspects of the language, under conditions where both vocabulary and morphology are learned in parallel (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Mirkovic &amp; Gaskell, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Walker et al., 2020)</ref>. There are numerous potential explanations for this, which could operate individually or cumulatively to explain learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Dekeyser, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Ellis, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Slabakova, 2019)</ref>, and that could limit the effectiveness of CSL to support acquisition of morphology.</p><p>First, the immediacy, or transparency, of a cue's referent may influence natural language learning. The function of the case markers was not immediately available within a single scene in <ref type="bibr">Rebuschat et al.'s (2021)</ref> study, but instead had to be interpreted from the interoperation among words within the sentence, and between potential agent and patient actors in the environment. This meant that the case markers were potentially more opaque as a referent to the markers than were the nouns, verbs, or adjectives, both because of their lower visual salience <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(van Zoest &amp; Donk, 2005)</ref> and because they required relations among words to be first established <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Gleitman et al., 2005)</ref> before the mappings could be constructed. Relatedly, the difficulty of learning functional morphology, according to the Bottleneck Hypothesis (BH) <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Slabakova, 2019)</ref>, is proposed to be due to the requirement that it requires integration with a variety of linguistic knowledge (e.g., syntax-morphology, or morphology-semantics) that affect the acceptability when processing the whole sentence. For example, the placement of the functional marker switches between the subject and the verb in English (e.g., Panda cooks, Pandas cook), which links morphological and syntactic variation. Relatedly, Ellis (2022) identified low contingency (low reliability), of morphology as a contributor to difficulty of learning, another aspect of transparency. For example, in English, the form -s can be interpreted as plural or third-person singular as in the Panda examples above, while the meaning of a word stem is much more stable. Thus, transparency is affected both within the language and in terms of mapping to the environment because of variation in the immediacy of the target referent <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Dekeyser, 2005)</ref>.</p><p>If opacity of referents and of mappings are contributors to CSL of morphology, then this is unlikely to be to the same degree across all targets for morphological features. For instance, tense morphology may be difficult to acquire because of difficulties in isolating temporal order in events <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Tünnermann &amp; Scharlau, 2018)</ref>, whereas number (e.g., singular or plural) may be easier to acquire because of its more immediate appearance in environmental stimuli -if there is one or more than one panda in the environment then that is easily observed, but whether the panda walked yesterday or will walk tomorrow cannot be determined from observation of the (current) environment. In contrast, subject-verb agreement may be harder to acquire both because it is not apparent in the environment, and also because of the integration of syntactic and morphological constraints that are required, potentially explaining why subject-verb agreement is widely observed to be difficult to learn in second language acquisition studies (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Jensen et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Lecouvet et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wu et al., 2022)</ref>.</p><p>A second possible contributor to lower levels of learning of morphology from CSL was that, in previous studies of case marking learning, the learning target (case marking) was largely absent from participants' native languages. The participants in <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Rebuschat et al. (2021)</ref>, for instance, were native English speakers, and English marks agent and patient roles only for pronouns. Learning an additional language can be influenced by previously learnt languages, the phenomenon of which is called cross-linguistic influence <ref type="bibr">(CLI;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">McManus, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Pajak et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Rothman et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Suethanapornkul, 2020)</ref>. A multitude of empirical evidence shows that L1 plays a dominant role in influencing additional language learning, both in classroom <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Ahn, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Chen, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Choi &amp; Ionin, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Finn &amp; Hudson Kam, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Hermas, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Hwang &amp; Lardiere, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">McManus, 2015)</ref> and immersion <ref type="bibr">(Diaubalick &amp; Guijarro-Fuente, 2019)</ref> settings.</p><p>The extent to which transfer occurs from previously learned languages to affect learning of an additional language has been proposed to depend on structural linguistic similarity on a language feature by language feature basis (e.g., Linguistic Proximity Model: <ref type="bibr">Westergaard, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">Westergaard et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Scalpel Model: Slabakova, 2017)</ref>. In particular, similarities of morphological features have been widely documented as affecting additional language learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Gardner et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Hawkins &amp; Hattori, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Jiang, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Van der Slik et al., 2019)</ref>. For instance, in an implicit language learning task, <ref type="bibr">Ellis (2007)</ref> found that adults with L1 that has little morphological inflection pay more attention to lexical cues rather than morphological cues. Similarly, a large dataset of L2 Dutch learners in <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Van der Slik et al. (2019)</ref>'s study revealed that those adults with morphologically less complex L1s performed worse in acquiring Dutch than those with morphologically richer L1s. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Jiang (2007)</ref> found that intermediate and advanced adult learners were better at detecting errors for morphemes that were not congruent with the learners' L1. Hence, whether the speaker's native language may influence the degree to which different morphological features are detected by the speaker. For example, Mandarin indicates simple present and future tense with prepositions (e.g.,他他他他他他他 tā yībān zhōuyī yóuyǒng (He usually on Monday swim), 他他他他他 wǒ míngtiān xuéxí (I tomorrow learn)), whereas English and German tend to indicate tense using morphology or short auxiliary verbs (e.g., I learned/Ich lernte, I will learn/Ich werde lernen), sometimes in addition to prepositions.</p><p>A third potential explanation for lower levels of learning of morphology compared to vocabulary learning from CSL is that morphological features require more cognitive effort to learn. Firstly, morphological features tend to be lower in saliency than content words <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Dekeyser, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Ellis, 2022)</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Finley (2023)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Rebuschat et al. (2021)</ref>, for instance, morphological markers were shorter than word stems (monosyllabic versus bisyllabic), which could reduce the ability of participants to detect them. The structure of these languages was such so as to respect the natural language property of inflectional and derivational morphology tending to be shorter than word stems <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bybee, 2010)</ref>. Secondly, morphological features tend to be less contingent in terms of form-meaning mappings. For example, the form of "-s" could indicate both plural and third person singular. Thirdly, the information that morphological features carry is often redundant and thus results in the learning of the morphological cues being blocked as it is cognitively more difficult to detect and to LEARNING MORPHOLOGY FROM CROSS-SITUATIONAL STATISTICS interpret. Due to the universality of this property of natural language, we do not investigate this potential contributor further.</p><p>In this study, we grasp this issue of the extent to which adults can learn the meaning of morphological cues where the referent is not immediately available from the environment, determining whether this varies for morphological cues with different functional targets and whether the ability to acquire the morphological cues from CSL depends on the speakers' affinity with morphological cues present within their native language. In this respect, we test two of the theoretical contributors to difficulties in learning morphology. The first is transparency, both within the language in terms of the extent to which the morphology is dependent or independent of syntactic constraints -thus, contrasting subject-verb agreement with tense and number features. But also within the environment, in terms of whether the referent is immediately detectable or not -thus contrasting number with subject-verb agreement and tense).</p><p>Previous studies of morphological learning have been shown to be challenging for learners <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Jiang, 2007)</ref>, even when learning is explicitly trained <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Ellis &amp; Sagarra, 2010)</ref>. Learning of morphology implicitly, from LEARNING MORPHOLOGY FROM CROSS-SITUATIONAL STATISTICS cross-situational statistics has also been shown to be difficult, and poorer than learning of nouns, verbs, or adjectives (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Rebuschat et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>Our first research question was therefore to determine which morphological features can be learned from cross-situational statistics, whether there is an overall difference in learning of morphology compared to other vocabulary, and if so, whether there are differences among different features in terms of their learnability. We thus tested the limits of cross-situational learning in supporting participants' acquisition of tense, number, and subject-verb agreement, in addition to learning of nouns and verbs. If learning is successful then this would indicate that morphological learning is feasible from implicit language exposure and does not require prior learning of word stems. If learning is not successful for morphology, but is effective for vocabulary, then this indicates that morphological learning may be sequential -after vocabulary is acquired -or that more salient cues might need to be made available to ensure learning. We predicted that, overall, nouns and verbs would be learned more accurately than tense, number, and subject-verb agreement. If transparency affects learning of morphology, then we also predicted that number would be learned more easily than tense and subject-verb agreement. However, in our study design, singular and plural morphemes each occur in half. Because tense was cued threeway, each of the past, present, and future inflectional cues appeared in only one-third of the trials. The discrepancy in frequency might lead to different learning outcomes as the role of frequency is considered one of the major factors in second language learning <ref type="bibr">(Larsen-Freeman, 1976;</ref><ref type="bibr">Larsen-Freeman, 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr">Ellis, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr">Ellis,1998;</ref><ref type="bibr">Ellis, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr">Ellis, 2008)</ref>.</p><p>The second contributor to morphological learning difficulty that we test is language background -the extent to which the participants' first language expresses few or many morphological features. For this second research question, we tested whether differences in morphological expressiveness in learners' L1 affected acquisition of different morphological features from cross-situational statistics. The results of the current study enable us to detect "bottlenecks" (the difficult linguistic features) for language learners from different native language backgrounds <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Slabakova, 2019)</ref>, with implications for the teaching focus of L2 grammar in a classroom.</p><p>For the language groups we selected speakers with L1 that varied in LEARNING MORPHOLOGY FROM CROSS-SITUATIONAL STATISTICS terms of morphological inflectional richness. We therefore tested participants with few inflectional morphological features in their L1 (Chinese), and speakers of L1 with several morphological features in the language but which are relatively poor (English) compared to speakers of languages with relatively rich morphological systems (German). The artificial language in our study included inflections for number and tense, which exist in both English and German languages but not in Chinese.</p><p>However, the German language contains richer morphological markers that are more complex than English (e.g., grammatical gender; case system). If there is a holistic transfer effect from L1 to additional language learning of morphology, then L1 morphological richness would affect learners' sensitivity towards (all of) the morphological features in the novel language, such that the German group should outperform both the English and Chinese L1 groups. However, if transfer is feature-by-feature according to structural similarity (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Westergaard et al., 2017)</ref> then the English and German groups should be similar to one another, and outperform the Chinese L1 group.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>Sample size was estimated by means of Monte Carlo simulations of data, which predicted that 35 participants per language group would be sufficient for power of 0.8. The detailed description of our power analysis can be found in our preregistration, <ref type="url" target="https://osf.io/dvpgq/">https://osf.io/dvpgq/</ref>. One hundred and seventeen native speakers of Chinese, English and German volunteered for this study. However, ten participants had to be excluded either because they took written notes during the experiment or because their language background did not meet the inclusion criteria of being a native speaker of either Chinese, English or German. Due to unexpected technical issues, two participants had to be excluded due to their missing data in the CSL task and debriefing questionnaires. Our final sample thus consisted of 105 participants (74 female, 31 male), which were distributed into three groups, based on their native language(s).</p><p>Thirty-five participants each spoke Chinese, English, and German as their native language. None of the participants reported having learned Portuguese, on which the phonetics of the artificial language were based.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>LEARNING MORPHOLOGY FROM CROSS-SITUATIONAL STATISTICS</head><p>However, all participants in L1 Chinese and L1 German groups reported to have learnt a second language that marked number, tense, and subject-verb agreement, mostly English, whereas 66% (23/35) of participants in the English-native-speakers group reported being monolingual. The mean age in our sample was 23.27 (SD = 4.72, range 18 to 36 years), and there were no significant differences between the groups in terms of age.</p><p>The study was approved by the ethics review panel of the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences at Lancaster University and conducted in accordance with the provisions of the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki. None of the participants were remunerated in this study. However, the English native speakers received course credits at their home institution for taking part.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Materials Artificial language</head><p>Vocabulary. There were 21 pseudowords in the language (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). Sixteen bisyllabic pseudowords served as either nouns or verbs: eight of these referred to distinct animal cartoon characters <ref type="bibr">(panda, pig, lion, mouse, sheep, rabbit, dog, cow)</ref> and the remaining eight to different actions <ref type="bibr">(cook, work, swim, run, sleep, walk, sing, paint)</ref>. Five monosyllabic pseudowords were morphological inflections for either singular or plural number, or past, present, or future tense. We created four different versions of the mappings between words and referents to avoid any biases for particular preferences between words and meanings, shown in Appendix 2.</p><p>In order to control for phonotactic preferences across language groups we constructed words from syllables that exist in all three languages with those syllables read by a female native speaker of Portuguese in a monotone. Every pseudo morpheme was read and recorded individually by a female native speaker of Portuguese in a monotone, aiming to avoid accents sound familiar to any of the language groups. The sound files of morphemes were formed into two-word sentences abiding grammar rules based on natural languages on Gorilla Experiment Builder (<ref type="url" target="https://gorilla.sc">https://gorilla.sc</ref>), with a 250ms pause between different words. For example, for the sentence "Fauluti pachunati" meaning "Pandas worked" was constructed as follows:</p><p>Faulu ti pachu na ti</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Noun plural verb past plural</head><p>Visual stimuli. Visual referents for nouns and verbs were presented in static images (See examples in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Eight animal cartoon characters (panda, pig, lion, mouse, sheep, rabbit, dog, cow) were used as visual referents for the eight nouns in the artificial language. Each image had either one or two of the same animals performing one of the eight tasks (working, walking, sleeping, singing, swimming, cooking, running, painting).</p><p>To reflect time of the event, a visual cue that indicated the time was presented using a written word (past/now/future) in participants` native language appearing within an icon (a left arrow for past, a circle for present, and a right arrow for future). Note that in previous studies teaching tense in artificial languages, researchers have trained participants on the meaning of time adverbs (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Ellis, 2007)</ref> prior to exposure to the grammar of the language, whereas we wanted to know whether participants could acquire the tense without this prior training. speaker, where the cues for the meaning of inflectional cues for tenses were  contains animal(s) that map with the nouns in artificial language, actions</p><p>that map with the verbs, and time reference that maps with the suffixes for tense, and number of the animals that maps with the suffixes for number. In the meantime, participants hear a sentence describing one of the pictures:</p><p>"/lutb ʃisaɪ naɪpəpaʊsaɪ/", which means "The dog will cook".</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Debriefing questionnaire (retrospective verbal reports)</head><p>We also asked questions to investigate whether explicit knowledge was developed during the implicit learning process and whether it predicted the learning outcome by adapting the awareness questionnaire from <ref type="bibr">Rebuschat et al.

The questions ask about what participants were aware of regarding the language structure, gradually providing more explicit information of the language to determine the participants' level of awareness (See appendix for details of the debriefing questionnaire).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure</head><p>After providing informed consent and providing background language information, participants were then exposed to the cross-situational learning task, involving training and test trials.

During each training trial, participants saw a fixation cross for 500 milliseconds, followed by seeing two static images cooccurring on the screen (See Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>). One of the images was the target for the sentence, and the other was a foil, which differed in between two and four of the features (e.g., animal, action, plurality, tense). A thousand milliseconds later, participants heard a sentence of the artificial language describing one of the two images. Right after the sentence finished, participants had to decide as soon as possible which image the sentence was referring to by pressing Q or P on the keyboard. No time limits were set for each trial but there were instructions before and between training trials that remind participants to respond quickly and accurately. By repeatedly experiencing the sentence-scene mappings, we tested whether participants could become sensitive to the co-occurrences of sentences in the language with the referents in the target scene. group.

Test trials for nouns, verbs, number, and tense were designed in the same way as the training trials, except that one of the four features (referents for noun, verb, tense, or number) differed between the two pictures (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>). Hence, the correct picture could be selected only if the learner was sensitive to the feature that differed between the two.

The experiment contained 8 blocks, including 5 training blocks (blocks 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7) and 3 mixed training and testing blocks (blocks 4, 6, and 8). There were 48 training trials in each training block. In each mixed block, there were 48 training trials and 32 test trials comprising 8 trials each for the target features of nouns, verbs, number, and tense, which were randomly inter-mixed. At the end of the mixed block, 8 subject-verb agreement test trials were presented (four grammatical, four ungrammatical). Nouns, verbs, and morphemes occurred an equal number of times within each block. Animal, action, tense, and number features in the pictures occurred an equal number of times in both target and foil scenes.</p></div>

(2015)</ref>'s coding scheme of awareness, ranking from full awareness to complete unawareness (see appendixes for all debriefing questions). Participants who reported using morphological rules to distinguish words strategically were considered to have "full awareness" (Q1~2), those who mentioned past, present, future (Q3), singular, plural (Q4) or specified the subject-verb agreement when asking about the patterns of the language or the morphology system were considered "partial awareness", and those who only mentioned tense, number or pattern of sounds were coded as having "minimal awareness" .</p><p>Participants who did not report tense, number or subject-verb agreement were coded as "unaware". All participants who reported minimal, partial, or full awareness were coded as "aware" and others "unaware".</p><p>Following the criteria outlined above, we found that sixty out of a hundred and fifty participants were fully aware of the morphological rules 之L1 Chinese: 21; L1 English: 12; L1 German: 28). All participants reported guessing at the beginning, but some later used strategies of calculating the number of categories in the pictures (animals, actions, time, number of animals) to figure out their meaning by comparing similar pictures. And some others reported that they learned from the errors when testing and renewing different assumptions. Seventeen participants at some level noticed the morphological cues. When asked about the meaning of inflectional cues, they either gave a generic answer like number or tense, SV agreement or were more specific about the meaning of each sound (e.g., "Yes, I believe 'sai' is highlighting a single character, while 'ti' stands for many." ; "The structure of the sentense is (subject+number suffixes+verb+tense+number suffixes)"). According to the criteria, nine participants were categorised as partially aware of the morphological rule (L1 Chinese: 4; L1 English: 2; L1 German: 3) and eight were minimally aware (L1 Chinese: 5; L1 English: 2; L1 German: 1). The rest of the twentyseven participants reported no awareness of the morphological cues (L1 Chinese: 5; L1 English: 19; L1 German: 3).

Note. Error bars represent 95% Confidence Intervals. As shown in Figure 7(A), the learning trajectories of aware and unaware participants are significantly different from each other. At the end To investigate the influence of awareness on adults' performance in CSL tasks, we employed mixed-effects models with fixed effects for block, L1 language, awareness status (aware vs. unaware), and their three-way interaction sequentially. We found that adding the fixed effects of Awareness significantly improved the model fit (χ²(6) = 3149.19, p &lt; .001), compared to the model with just Block, L1. This suggests that the generalisation of awareness predicts the accuracy of the CSL tasks.</p><p>However, the inclusion of their interactions did not significantly enhance the model fit (χ²(1) = 1.18, p = .277). The best-fitting model, which included awareness, block, language, and their interactions, is detailed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">9</ref>.</p><p>The analysis of the debriefing questionnaire demonstrates the importance of awareness of the morphological features in the early acquisition of second language learning, specifically in an immersive learning setting. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Overall, the results show that adults have the cognitive ability to solve the form-meaning mappings of morphological features, along with acquiring the vocabulary by processing sentence-based cross-situational statistics.</p><p>Participants' performance on both training and test trials significantly improved over blocks. Regarding the effect of L1 background, we found that while participants' performance in training trials was not affected by L1 morphological complexity, Chinese, and German native speakers learned more rapidly than English native speakers over time. In test trials, German and Chinese native speakers have a distinctive higher accuracy than English native speakers. We also investigated whether vocabulary and morphology were learned to different degrees. The results suggest that learners perceive the acquisition of vocabulary and morphology in our artificial language, given their distinctive levels of salience, to involve a comparable degree of cognitive processing difficulty. Results also showed that learning the meaning of cues in CVCV and CV forms are processed at a similar level of cognitive effort in L1 Chinese group but not in L1 English group, which indicates that L1 English groups are more sensitive towards the effect of cue salience. In terms of morphology learning, Subject-verb agreement was learned better than inflectional cues for numbers, followed by tense markers. The form-meaning mappings of tense and number are processed at a similar level of cognitive effort among the three L1 groups.</p><p>Lastly, as an exploratory analysis, we found an overall noun learning bias in our results. Next, we will examine each of these findings in depth.</p><p>For research question 1, we found that adults can rapidly map the form-meaning of both lexical and morphological cues. Our findings suggest that it is likely adults possess the cognitive ability to rapidly map sounds of inflectional cues to their meanings/functions in an immersive learning environment, without any feedback or explicit instruction of vocabulary or grammar. As we have controlled the cooccurrence of nouns and verbs, and their combination with morphemes, it is likely that participants learnt by keeping track of the cross-situational statistics rather than memorising chunking (one part of the sentences). In contrast to findings in previous CSL studies (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Monaghan et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Rebuschat et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Walker et al., 2020)</ref>, the success of learning the morphological cues (including the more abstract subject-verb agreement) in our study might be due to that all the targeted linguistic features (noun, verb, inflectional cues for number and tense, subject-verb agreement, SV order) were possessed in participants' native languages or previously learnt languages. The discrepancy of findings between studies tentatively supports that the L1-absent morphological markers limit the short-term and perhaps long-term attainment of L2, aligned with findings in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Jiang (2007)</ref>.</p><p>The robust learning might not reflect natural language learning due to the high salience level of morphological cues in our study. Although we manipulated inflectional cues to be lower salience than lexical cues, the inflectional cues in our artificial language were still higher than some inflectional cues in naturalistic languages. For example, the cues for past tense "-ed" in the example of an English sentence, "Yesterday I walked.", were only pronounced as a single consonant /t/, which was less pronounced than /CV/ form in our artificial inflectional cues. In our study, participants performed very similarly in both vocabulary and morphology tests, which means the differences in perceptual salience between /CV/ and /CVCV/were not enough to reflect the discrepancy of salience between morphological cues and lexical cues in natural language. Although the effect of cue salience can be mitigated by instruction <ref type="bibr">(Cintrón-Valentín and Ellis, 2016)</ref>, cue salience is one of the determiners of morphology learning difficulty in natural language learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Ellis, 2022)</ref>. However, how much salience of a cue, over the spectrum of perceptual salience, distinguishes the lexical and morphological form-meaning mapping, is yet to be further researched.</p><p>The high contingency of the morphological cues in our study could also explain the similar accuracy observed in morphology and vocabulary tests. Note that inflectional cues in natural languages are often not only low salience compared to vocabulary but also low contingency <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Ellis, 2022)</ref>. For example, the form "s" in English could mean plural or present singular. The form "-ing" could represent a noun but it could also mean the action is ongoing. The inflectional cues in our study were less complicated. Both inflectional cues and lexical cues were bound with one meaning individually.</p><p>This finding indicates that low salience of morphological cues alone might not be responsible for morphology learning difficulty, at least not to a large extent. The low contingency of the form-meaning mapping in morphology might.</p><p>Our study shows much higher learning of functional markers than previous studies where case marker was found to be difficult to learn <ref type="bibr">(Katharina et al., in prep;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Monaghan et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Rebuschat et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Walker et al., 2020)</ref>. Compared to the mapping of case markers in <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Rebuschat et al. (2021)</ref> and its replicate studies, the mapping of inflectional cues (number and time reference) in our study is less ambiguous and is visually more available. For example, inflectional cues for the quantity of the subjects were visually easier to spot cross-situationally, while the interpretations of the two case markers were more hidden behind the two objects interacting with each other in the visual world. According to the bottleneck hypothesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Slabakova, 2019)</ref>, the functional morphology, such as subject-verb agreement was claimed to be the most difficult part to learn in second language acquisition, due to the property of morphology that is intertwined with syntactical and semantical knowledge. The results in our study show otherwise. Robust learning was also found in the subject-verb agreement tests, which indicates that the difficulty of learning might not come from the "agreement" between the subject and the verb. In other words, the intertwining of morphology and syntax might not cause the learning difficulty. What seemed like a syntactical-semantic problem was a mapping problem. In our study, although the singular/plural markers agree between subject and verb, they always map one meaning in the visual world. In contrast, in the case of third person -s in English, the same form "s", the number marker that switches between subject and verb, could indicate either one or two objects in the visual world.</p><p>For research question 2, we did not find significant differences between groups, which means we did not find evidence that having a morphologically rich L1 makes a difference in learning L2 morphology. The influence of L1 on performance in our study is nuanced and contextdependent, varying across different levels of the block variable. This finding is not in line with the findings in <ref type="bibr">Van der Slik et all. (2019)</ref>, where he found L1 morphologically poor speakers tend to have lower proficiency in L2.</p><p>However, they also found that commanding a morphologically rich L2 facilitates adult L2A. This is consistent with our result which indicates prior language experience might have a larger effect on adult L2A. The much higher learning of the functional markers in our study might be due to that most Chinese native speakers and German native speakers report having a high proficiency in at least another language, which might tune their learning attention because of this explicit learning background of numbers and tense markers <ref type="bibr">(Bono, 2011)</ref>. Although Chinese native speakers do not have number and tense markers in their L1, the experience of explicitly learning another language tunes their attention to those markers during the CSL.</p><p>Our results indicate that learned attention is not only L1-tuned but might be tuned by properties in all previously learned language(s). The role of L1 is less dominant when it comes to second language learning. All previously learnt languages act together as a whole impacting our learned attention in second language learning.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>Our study provides evidence that adults possess the cognitive ability to learn vocabulary and morphology under cross-situational learning conditions, implicating that the limited attainment from adult L2A might not be due to biological reasons. The current study also provides more understanding on what Ellies (2022) proposed that cue salience as one of the factors that makes morphology difficult to learn. Further research exploring the role of cue salience is necessary for better understanding of the adult morphology learning.</p><p>We also found that L1 does not act as a dominant language to influence L2 morphology learning in cross-situational learning contexts. The result implicates that cross-linguistic might transfer happened property by property and it can be from all previous-learnt language. Further research can focus on whether being a bilingual or receiving explicit instruction of a second language have a larger impact on adult L2A.</p><p>One-sample t-tests and Cohen's d for performance against chance level (0.5) for each test type at each test block.  <ref type="bibr">(10.93 (15.50 (13.90 (21.55 (20.02 (18.</ref>07</p><p>Ger man **, 1.04) **, 1.21) ***, 1.87) ***, 2.66) ***, 2.38) ***, 3.70) ***, 3.43) ***, 3.10) * P &lt; .05 ** P &lt; .0125 *** P &lt; .001 Note.
