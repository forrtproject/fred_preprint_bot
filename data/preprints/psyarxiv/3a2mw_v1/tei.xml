<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Unemployed people bear a stigma that builds on the stereotype of "the unemployed" and is associated with many adverse outcomes. No study has used the dimensions and facets of the latest integrated stereotype framework to describe their stereotype and compare it with other groups. In Study 1 among university students (n = 241), we show that unemployed people are rated lower than employed people on the horizontal and the vertical dimensions of their stereotypes, as well as on the facets of capacity, assertiveness, morality and friendliness.</p><p>We also show that unemployed people are also rated the lowest when compared to a highhigh occupation (firefighters) and a low-low occupation (railroad workers). In study 2, we replicate these findings with university students (n = 193) and show that unemployed people are also blatantly dehumanized when compared to the same targets. In Study 3, we show that vocational integration workers (n = 123) also rate unemployed people lower than employed people on both dimensions and facets, but not on morality. Overall, we conclude that unemployed people have a highly destructive stereotype that is lacking in every dimension and facet, and that they are overly despised.</p></div>

A stigma is a mark that communicates a devalued social identity in a specific context <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Major &amp; O'Brien, 2005)</ref>. Consequently, an unemployed person may be stigmatized if they are labeled as "unemployed," are applied a negative stereotype and are ostracized and treated differently by a person in a position of power because of that label and stereotype <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Link &amp; Phelan, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Major &amp; O'Brien, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Pescosolido &amp; Martin, 2015)</ref>.</p><p>The stigma of "the unemployed" is built on a stereotype, which is a set of shared beliefs about the characteristics and behavior of people of a given group <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Leyens et al., 1994)</ref>.</p><p>In France, the stereotype of unemployment is highly negative with unemployed people being described as poor, lazy and idle <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Camus &amp; Berjot, 2015)</ref>. One of the most prominent models of stereotypes, the Stereotype Content Model, postulates that they are organized in a twodimensional structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Fiske et al., 2002)</ref>. According to this model, stereotypes would be constructed along a dimension of warmth (i.e., what are the group's intentions toward self or in-group) and competence (i.e., how effective will the group be in pursuing those intentions), with most stereotypes being mixed and a combination of high warmth and low competence or the opposite. Previous research has shown that unemployed people and people receiving welfare benefits are among the groups that score lower, if not the lowest, on both the warmth and competence dimensions compared to many other groups in Germany <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Asbrock, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Friehs et al., 2022)</ref> and the United States <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Cuddy et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Fiske et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">He et al., 2019)</ref>. In addition, <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Norlander et al. (2020)</ref> showed that resumes depicting current unemployment were rated as less competent and less warm of resumes of employed people in the United States. Moreover, <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Okoroji et al. (2023)</ref> conducted audit studies. First, they found that resumes depicting current unemployment were rated as less competent but no less moral and friendly than resumes depicting current employment. Second, resumes depicting current unemployment were less likely to be interviewed and hired for a job opening than resumes depicting current employment. Third, the effects of employment status were fully mediated by the competence judgments.</p><p>The stereotype content model has recently been combined with other stereotype models into an integrated framework that organizes stereotypes into two orthogonal dimensions <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Abele et al., 2021)</ref>. The first dimension is referred to as "vertical" and is very similar to the competence dimension of the stereotype content model. In addition, the dimension is further divided into the facets of ability and assertiveness, which refer to the ability and the motivation of members of a group to carry out their intentions. The second dimension is "horizontal" and is very similar to the warmth dimension of the stereotype content model. It is also divided into two facets of morality and friendliness, referring respectively to respect for moral values and the ability to relate to others. In addition, the integrated framework emphasizes that observers who rate a group lower on the vertical dimension are more likely to rate the same group higher on the horizontal dimension. This compensation effect would serve justice concerns in creating and maintaining harmonious intergroup relations <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Yzerbyt, 2018)</ref>.</p><p>The stigma and stigmatization of unemployed people, as well as their negative stereotype, has many consequences. First, they may be the target of acute and daily stigmatization, expect to be the target of stereotypes, prejudice and discrimination and internalize the stigma of unemployment by adopting the negative thoughts and feelings associated with their stigmatized identity <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Fox et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Marie, de Araujo, et al., 2024)</ref>.</p><p>The acute and everyday stigmatization of unemployed people can take many forms, such as being othered and dehumanized in the British and the French written press <ref type="bibr">(Marie &amp; Bourguignon, 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Okoroji et al., 2021)</ref>, being discriminated against in access to employment based on the time spent unemployed <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Eriksson &amp; Rooth, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Ghayad, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Kroft et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Van Belle et al., 2018)</ref> and being treated differently by employment counselors <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Hentzgen et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr">Marie, Bouchat, et al., 2024)</ref>. Stigmatization of unemployed people has been linked to their poorer physical and mental health as well as lower well-being when compared to employed people <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Brand, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Krug et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Krug &amp; Eberl, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Marie, Rauscher, et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">McKee-Ryan et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Paul &amp; Moser, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Wanberg, 2012)</ref>. Finally, unemployed people actively manage their stigma. For example, some may hide their status, reduce their number of job applications and not apply for public assistance and unemployment benefits to avoid stigmatizing contexts <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Hentzgen et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Hoffmann et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr">Marie, Bouchat, et al., 2024)</ref>. On the contrary, some others may submit more applications to leave unemployment <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(de Araujo et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Krug et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Marie, Rauscher, et al., 2024)</ref>. Finally, they could organize and delegitimize their stigma, which has been shown to protect their well-being <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bourguignon et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Garcia-Lorenzo et al., 2022)</ref> Given the many consequences of the stigma of being unemployed, a good understanding of its stereotype and its content could help researchers and practitioners in designing ways to reduce its negative effects. If few works have compared unemployed people either to employed people or to other groups using the dimensions of warmth and competence, no work has yet examined their stereotype using the new vertical and horizontal dimensions as well as their facets. Therefore, we conducted three studies to explore the stereotype content of "the unemployed" and its relationships.</p><p>In the first study, we compare the "unemployed" with the "workers" group on the two dimensions and the four facets of their stereotypes to replicate the results of <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Norlander et al. (2020)</ref>. We then compare unemployed people to a group of highly valued workers (firefighters, who have been shown to be in a high-high combination, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Friehs et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">He et al., 2019)</ref> and a group of despised workers (railroad workers, who are a highly despised group in France). In the second study, we replicate the findings of the first study and explore the blatant dehumanization of unemployed people. In the third study, we replicate the results of the first and second studies among professional integration workers.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hypotheses</head><p>Based on previous literature, we hypothesized that unemployed people would be judged lower than employed people on the vertical and horizontal dimensions of their stereotype (H1a) and on the four facets of their stereotype (H1b). We also hypothesized that unemployed people would be judged higher on the horizontal dimension than on the vertical dimension, reflecting a compensation effect (H2a). We hypothesized the opposite for employed individuals (H2b). In addition, we hypothesized that unemployed people would be rated lowest on the dimension of their stereotypes (H3a) and on the facets of their stereotypes (H3b) compared to the high-high occupation of firefighters and the low-low occupation of railroad workers. Finally, we hypothesized that attitude toward unemployed people would be lower than toward employed people (H4a) and the lowest when compared to the high-high occupation of firefighters and the low-low occupation of railroad workers (H4a).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure</head><p>University students completed an online survey. They first gave their consent to participate and then provided their year of birth, gender and field of education. They were then asked to express their opinions by representing, as best they could, railroad workers, firefighters and unemployed people. The order of the questions related to stereotypes was counterbalanced and randomized.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures</head><p>Based on the work of <ref type="bibr">Abele et al. (2021, Table 1)</ref>, the vertical dimension was measured by the items ambitious, confident, competent and efficient<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">foot_0</ref> . The first two items refer to the facet of assertiveness and the last two to the facet of capacity. The horizontal dimension was measured by the items honest, sincere, sociable and warm<ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">foot_1</ref> . The first two items refer to the facet of morality and the last two items refer to the facet of friendliness. The scales ranged from 1 Not at all to 7 Completely. We also measured attitudes using a thermometer ranging from 0 to 100, with a score of 50 indicating neither a favorable nor an unfavorable attitude toward the group in question. We combined answers relative to firefighters and railroad workers to obtain social judgment and attitude about workers. Psychometric analyses are reported in Table <ref type="table">S1</ref> in the Appendix.</p></div>

Moreover, in France, job counselors can reduce or stop unemployment benefits if they think unemployed people are not making enough efforts to find a job.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General discussion</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion of the hypotheses</head><p>First, we found strong support across all three studies for the hypothesis that unemployed people would be judged lower than employed people on the vertical and the horizontal dimensions of their stereotype (H1a). These results replicate previous findings comparing unemployed people to many groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Asbrock, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Cuddy et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Fiske et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Friehs et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">He et al., 2019)</ref> and specifically to the group of workers <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Norlander et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Okoroji et al., 2023)</ref>. Interestingly, the differences were much smaller among professional integration workers than among university students, which we will discuss below.</p><p>In addition, we found strong support in three studies for the hypothesis that unemployed people would be rated lower than employed people on all facets of their stereotype (H1b). Two samples of university students and one sample of vocational integration workers rated unemployed people lower on the facets of capacity, assertiveness and friendliness. Finally, unemployed people were also judged less moral than employed people by university students, but not by professional integration workers. These findings partially replicate, challenge and extend the results of <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Okoroji et al. (2023)</ref>, who showed that resumes with current unemployment were judged as less competent but were not judged as less moral and friendly than resumes with current employment, in three ways. First, in our sample of vocational integration workers, we replicated their findings that unemployed people were rated as moral as employed people. Thus, vocational integration workers did not judge unemployed people to be less moral and may not see them as freeloaders, at least no more than employed people. This is consistent with previous work on the media treatment of unemployed people, which has found that integration workers and organizations tend to portray them as facing obstacles and difficulties in finding employment, perhaps because of an external attribution of unemployment, or of intergroup contacts <ref type="bibr">(Marie, Bouchat, et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr">Marie &amp; Bourguignon, 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Rauscher et al., 2024)</ref>. Second, we found that unemployed people were rated as less friendly while <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Okoroji et al. (2023)</ref> did not. This discrepancy may be because we asked people about their stereotypes of employed and unemployed people, whereas <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Okoroji et al. (2023)</ref> asked for judgments about resumes. Third, they only used a measure of the dimension of competence while we used measures of the facets of ability and assertiveness. Doing so, we found in three studies that unemployed people were rated lower on both facets when compared to employed people. Again, professional integration workers' differences were much smaller than university students, which might be due to intergroups contacts <ref type="bibr">(Marie, Bouchat, et al., 2024)</ref>.</p><p>We also found support across all three studies for the hypothesis that unemployed people would be judged higher on the horizontal dimension than on the vertical dimension (H2a). On the opposite, we also found support for the hypothesis that employed people would be rated higher on the vertical dimension than on the horizontal dimension in two studies among university students (H2b). These compensation effects could be interpreted in two ways. First, they could reflect that social inequalities between employed and unemployed people are perceived as large, stable, legitimate and trigger a concern for justice and harmonious relations <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Abele et al., 2021)</ref>. Second, these concerns might be more pronounced among university students than among vocational integration workers, who only show a compensation effect toward unemployed people <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Abele et al., 2021)</ref>. Moreover, we found strong support across two studies for the hypothesis that unemployed people would be judged lowest on both dimensions of their stereotype compared to the high-high occupation of firefighters and the low-low occupation of railroad workers (H3a) as well as on the facets of their stereotypes (H3b). Unemployed people were systematically judged the lowest on the vertical and the horizontal dimensions, as well as on the capacity, assertiveness, morality and friendliness facets. These findings extend those previously reported in that unemployed people were not only judged more harshly than workers or a valued group, but also than a highly despised low-low occupation. It strengthens our conclusion that unemployed people are highly scorned and that having no job is judged worse than having a despised one <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Asbrock, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Cuddy et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Fiske et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Friehs et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">He et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Norlander et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Okoroji et al., 2023)</ref>.</p><p>In line with these results, we also found strong support in all three studies for the hypothesis that attitude toward unemployed people would be lower than toward employed people (H4a) and toward the high-high occupation of firefighters and the low-low occupation of railroad workers (H4b).</p><p>Finally, in one study, we showed that unemployed people were so despised that people could blatantly dehumanized them and declare that they are "less evolutionarily advanced" when compared to employed people (H5a), as well as when compared to the high-high occupation of firefighters and the low-low occupation of railroad workers (H5b). Although a very violent finding, the hypothesis was theoretically and logically derived from the literature and echoes earlier findings by <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Harris and Fiske (2006)</ref> who showed that groups rated lowest on both stereotype dimensions are dehumanized.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Implications</head><p>First, our work suggests that the stigma of unemployment could be better integrated into job search programs. On the one hand, employment services could create an environment in which the use of the unemployment stereotype is either neutralized or rendered useless for both vocational integration workers and recruiters. Positive perspectives include resumes that emphasize the number of years an applicant has worked (rather than employment dates, which may convey gaps, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Kristal et al., 2023)</ref>, encouraging and training recruiters to use state-of-theart recruitment methods such as standardized interviews <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Highhouse, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Ryan &amp; Ployhart, 2014)</ref> and changing the hiring process of firms <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Salognon, 2007)</ref>. Conversely, anonymous resumes, although initially appealing, have been shown to have detrimental effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Behaghel et al., 2015)</ref>. On the other hand, employment services could also support unemployed people in getting organized to delegitimize the stigma of unemployment and buffer against its negative effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bourguignon et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Garcia-Lorenzo et al., 2022)</ref>.</p><p>Then, our analyses showed much smaller differences among vocational integration workers than among university students. This is consistent with <ref type="bibr">Marie, Bouchat, et al. (2024)</ref>, who have shown that more qualitative contact with unemployed people predicts a smaller difference in attitudes between employed and unemployed people. Thus, the literature on intergroup contact could be applied to the context of unemployment and extended to the stereotype of unemployed people <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Abele et al., 2021)</ref>. This could help practitioners develop interventions that might improve the stereotype of unemployed people, leading to better services and support for them.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limits</head><p>The first limitation stems from the cross-sectional method. Future studies could use an audit-like method that presents CVs <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Norlander et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Okoroji et al., 2023)</ref> or vignettes <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Van Belle et al., 2018)</ref> to allow for causal inference.</p><p>A second limitation stems from the fact that we only asked for judgments about unemployed people, firefighters, railroad workers, or employed people in general and did not examine different durations of unemployment. Prior research has shown that unemployed people are discriminated against and judged more harshly depending on how long they have been unemployed <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Eriksson &amp; Rooth, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Ghayad, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Kroft et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Van Belle et al., 2018)</ref>. Future studies could explore the dimensions and facets of stereotypes as a function of unemployment duration.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>People who are unemployed are disliked and carry a stigma that is based on the stereotype of "the unemployed", which has been linked to many harmful individual and collective outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bourguignon et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Camus &amp; Berjot, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Leyens et al., 1994)</ref>.</p><p>First, we replicated previous work and showed that unemployed people are rated lower on the two vertical and horizontal dimensions of a stereotype <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Abele et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Asbrock, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Cuddy et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Fiske et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Friehs et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">He et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Norlander et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Okoroji et al., 2023)</ref>. Then, we extended this work and showed that unemployed people were also rated lower on the vertical and the horizontal dimension than a high-high occupation (firefighters) and a low-low occupation (railroad workers). Finally, we used the most recent integrated model of stereotypes, which further subdivides both dimensions into the facets of ability and assertiveness for the vertical one and morality and friendliness for the horizontal one <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Abele et al., 2021)</ref>. In two studies of university students, we found that unemployed people were rated lowest on all four facets. In the third study, vocational integration workers rated unemployed people lower on the three facets of friendliness, capacity and assertiveness, but not on morality.</p><p>In addition, we showed that attitudes toward unemployed people were lower than toward employed people and were also the lowest compared to the high-high occupation of firefighters and the low-low occupation of railroad workers.</p><p>Finally, we showed that the stereotype of unemployed people is so negative that they are blatantly dehumanized when compared to employed people, but also to the high-high and low-low occupations of firefighters and railroad workers.</p><p>In summary, our study shows that unemployed people are stereotyped in a very negative way and that unemployment is so despised that not having a job is considered worse than having a despised job. This negative stereotype and its stigmatization are in turn linked to several highly detrimental consequences that further hinder their ability to find employment 605 in a vicious circle that could be addressed by employment services.
