<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Urban greenspaces provide valuable ecosystem services to urban residents, and their benefits may have functioned even better during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to determine the relationship between the use of urban greenspaces and the level of human subjective health (based on the subjective assessment of one's own status of social, mental, and physical health) before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. An online survey was conducted to explore how the frequency of use of urban greenspaces differed before and during the COVID-19 pandemic and what types of urban greenspaces were associated with improved human subjective health in 2019 (before COVID-19) and 2020 (during COVID-19). The frequency of urban greenspace use decreased from 2019 to 2020, suggesting the limited use of greenspaces during the pandemic. Furthermore, the types of urban greenspaces associated with improved health in 2019 differed, to varying degrees, from those in 2020.</p><p>Notably, during the pandemic, greenspaces along urban streets were associated with improved mental and social health. We suggest that street greenspaces be the most familiar and closest greenspaces to urban residents, thereby contributing to improved human health through contact with nature, even during the pandemic. Thus, our study highlights the importance of urban greenspaces, especially street greenspaces, which are the closest and most common to individuals, in maintaining and improving human health in this urban era.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Urban greenspaces provide a wide range of ecosystem services that improve the lives and health of individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Wolch et al., 2014)</ref>. For example, interactions with urban greenspaces can reduce mental fatigue <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Kaplan, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Barton and Pretty, 2010)</ref> and provide opportunities for exercise and recreation, thereby improving physical health <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Mytton et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Schipperijn et al., 2013)</ref>. Urban greenspaces are often used as places for social interaction in which individuals can communicate with others <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Smith et al., 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Maas et al., 2009)</ref>. These ecosystem services, supported by urban greenspaces, may function even better during the COVID-19 pandemic <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Soga et al., 2021)</ref>. Due to the high number of confirmed cases of infection and the resulting deaths, the World Health Organization (WHO) designated it as a pandemic in March 2020 <ref type="bibr">(World Health Organization, 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Governments in several countries have implemented various response policies to protect public health. While these measures were effective in preventing the spread of infectious diseases, they had a major negative impact on health and personal well-being <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Galea et al., 2020)</ref>. For example, physical activity was reduced due to the blockade of activity sites, and individuals were less likely to interact with others because they refrained from going out. Additionally, there was a sense of anxiety regarding the spread of infectious diseases. Under such constraints on anthropogenic activities during the COVID-19 pandemic, we expect that various urban greenspaces should have contributed to improving the mental, social, and physical aspects of subjective well-being and health. Understanding the relative importance of urban greenspace types in improving subjective health during COVID-19 is crucial for urban greenspace planning but has been understudied; thus, it is the focus of this study.</p><p>Previous studies have focused on changes in the frequency of the use of urban greenspaces before and during COVID-19. Using mobility information from the Google Community Mobility Report, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Geng et al. (2021)</ref> revealed that the frequency of visits to urban connected to shrines and temples <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Twohig-Bennett &amp; Jones, 2018)</ref>, the effects of the visiting frequency of a particular greenspace on the level of subjective health differ according to the focal greenspace type. Nonetheless, numerous previous studies have focused on a limited type of urban greenspace, particularly urban parks <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Yigitcanlar et al., 2020)</ref>, or have investigated the relationship between the use of urban greenspaces and subjective health without specifying the type of urban greenspace <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Huang et al., 2017)</ref>. In this study, we examined the relative importance of urban greenspace types in improving subjective health during COVID-19 to provide a complementary and detailed understanding of the importance of urban greenspaces.</p><p>We aimed to explore the relationship between the frequency of visits to urban greenspace types (including small pocket parks, large parks, street trees, gardens, schools, and greenspaces connected to shrines and temples) and subjective health (based on the subjective assessment of one's own social, mental, and physical health status) before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, two questions were addressed using an online survey. First, we examined the differences in the frequency of visits to each urban greenspace type during and before the COVID-19 pandemic. Second, we examined the relationship between the frequency of visits to urban greenspace types and subjective health before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. As previous studies have suggested that participants' social attributes and lifestyle habits are associated with their level of subjective health, we considered potential confounding factors that may affect their subjective health status in the analysis. For example, the frequency of smoking and drinking negatively affects subjective well-being (K. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Smith et al., 2016)</ref>. Individuals with higher income are likely to experience better subjective well-being <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Adeline &amp; Delattre, 2017)</ref>. Furthermore, the percentage of green cover in the participants' residential areas correlates well with their general status of subjective health <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Maas et al., 2006)</ref>. This research sheds light on the importance of various types of urban greenspaces in improving subjective health and well-being under increasing uncertainty in a changing world.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Study area and COVID-19 pandemic restrictions</head><p>Our study area comprised 23 wards in Tokyo. Tokyo's 23 wards are the largest cities in Japan, with an area spanning 627.53 km 2 and a population of approximately 9.77 million(Bureau of General Affairs, 2023; Geospatial Information Authority of Japan, 2023b).</p><p>Residents of the 23 wards in Tokyo were forced to change their lifestyles because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The first infected person appeared in Tokyo on January 23, 2020; the number of infected individuals increased thereafter. The first state of emergency was declared between April 7 and May 25, 2020. During the state of emergency, individuals were forced to refrain from unnecessary outings, and events attracting large crowds were restricted <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Tashiro &amp; Shaw, 2020)</ref>. Even outside the period of the state of emergency, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare in Japan urged individuals to avoid the three "C"s, which refer to "closed spaces," "crowded places," and "close-contact settings." This was the basic strategy used in Japan to prevent cluster outbreaks. By 2023, the Japanese government decided to downgrade COVID-19 to a common infectious disease.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Online survey</head><p>The survey was conducted using a structured questionnaire and an online survey system provided by Rakuten Insight, Inc. Rakuten Insight is one of the largest research panels in Japan, comprising approximately 2.2 million individuals registered for various services provided by Rakuten groups as of April 2019. The survey was conducted by screening those living in the 23 wards of Tokyo in 2021 (when the survey was conducted) and in the same locations in 2019 and 2020. An online questionnaire was administered between 10:00 p.m. on October 28 and 10:00 a.m. on October 29, 2021. In total, 1000 participants completed the questionnaire. The survey consisted of three questions (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). We inquired about the participants' subjective well-being, the frequency and purpose of greenspace visits, and sociodemographic attributes in 2019 (before the COVID-19 pandemic) and 2020 (during the COVID-19 pandemic).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.1.">Subjective Well-being Inventory (SUBI)</head><p>The SUBI is not an index of medical health but a subjective assessment of one's health status <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Igarashi &amp; Iijima, 2006)</ref>. It was developed by WHO to measure mental, social, and physical health <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Tonan et al., 1995)</ref>. One advantage of this is that the questionnaire is simple, allowing participants to complete the survey in a short measure time. In addition, previous studies have suggested that subjective well-being significantly impacts a person's quality of life, which cannot necessarily be measured based on medical health status. High subjective well-being can even increase survival rates, irrespective of one's medical condition, (G. A. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Kaplan &amp; Camacho, 1983)</ref> and may also affect life expectancy within a few years <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Kanda et al., 2000)</ref>. Therefore, it is used in various research fields, including psychology, sociology, gerontology, medical science, public health, and nursing <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Toyoshima et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Srivastava and Muhammad, 2023)</ref>. The statements asked in this study followed the Japanese version defined in the paper "Production of The Subjective Well-being Inventory Japanese Edition: It's Reliability and Validity" <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Tonan et al., 1995)</ref>. The questions in the online questionnaire were in Japanese, although they were translated into English for the demonstration in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>.</p><p>Six questions pertaining to mental, social, and physical health were asked. Each question was rated on a five-point Likert scale (from 1 to 5) (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). "Item name" represents the characteristic of each question used throughout this study. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.2.">Frequency and purpose of urban greenspace visits</head><p>We inquired about the frequency and purpose of visiting urban greenspaces (including small pocket parks, large parks, greenspaces along streets, gardens, schools, greenspaces connected to shrines and temples, and other greenspaces) within a 30-min walk of their homes (i.e., within walking distance, approximately a 3 km radius from their homes). Urban greenspaces were defined as any open space covered with vegetation, such as trees and herbs, except for private properties, such as home gardens. We also defined a visit to an urban greenspace as a visit with an exact purpose, excluding commuting to a working office or school. Thus,</p><p>participants were asked about the frequency of visits, staying time, percentage of visits per greenspace type, and purpose for visits per greenspace type (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>). (1) Small pocket park</p><p>(2) Large park</p><p>(3) Greenspaces along streets</p><p>Participants were asked to provide an integral number to items (1)-( <ref type="formula">7</ref>) such that the total is 10.</p><p>(4) Garden (1) Small pocket park</p><p>(2) Large Park</p><p>(3) Greenspaces along streets (4) Garden ( <ref type="formula">5</ref> Other (an open-ended question)."</p><p>* In Q2-1, participants were instructed to answer "0" if they do not visit urban greenspaces at all and "1" if they visit them less than once a week but at least once a month. Participants who answered 0 to Q2-1 were not presented with questions Q2-2 and Q2-3.</p><p>** Supplementary explanations were provided for certain urban greenspaces to enhance (3) Greenspaces along streets: street trees, grass beds, and shrubberies located beneath street trees <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Heikkinen et al., 2023)</ref>.</p><p>*** Urban greenspace types that were not visited by each participant in Q2-2 (urban greenspace types with "0" in Q2-2) were automatically removed in Q2-3.</p><p>The frequency of visits to each urban greenspace type was calculated from the responses to Q2-1(frequency of visits to urban greenspaces per week) and Q2-2 (percentage of visits to each urban greenspace type). In other words, the frequency of visits to urban greenspaces in general (Q2-1) was weighted by the percentage of visits to each urban greenspace type.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.3.">Socio-demographic and other attributes of participants</head><p>Finally, we asked the participants about their basic information. Previous studies have shown that subjective health is affected by participants' socio-demographic attributes, surrounding environment, and lifestyle habits. To consider these confounding factors in the analysis, we also asked participants for information on sex, age, income, zip code, frequency of alcohol consumption, frequency of smoking, marital status, and parental status (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref>). "4. 2,000,000 JPY ~ 3,000,000 JPY." "5.</p><p>3,000,000 JPY ~ 4,000,000 JPY." "6.</p><p>4,000,000 JPY ~ 5,000,000 JPY." "7.</p><p>5,000,000 JPY ~ 6,000,000 JPY." "8.</p><p>6,000,000 JPY ~ 7,000,000 JPY." "9.</p><p>7,000,000 JPY ~ 8,000,000 JPY." "10.</p><p>8,000,000 JPY ~ 9,000,000 JPY." "11. 9,000,000 JPY ~ 10,000,000 JPY." "12.</p><p>10,000,000 JPY ~ 12,000,000 JPY." "13.</p><p>12,000,000 JPY ~ 15,000,000 JPY." "14.</p><p>15,000,000 JPY+" "15. I was unaware." The percentage of green cover surrounding the participants' residential locations was calculated based on their zip codes using ArcGIS Pro v3.1. Digital national land information(Geospatial Information Authority of Japan, 2023a) and land cover data (Advanced Land Observing Satellite, 2023) were used. The percentage of green cover within a 3-km buffer from the center of the zip code was calculated and used in the analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Data analysis</head><p>All analyses were performed using R software (version 4.2.2; R Development Core Team). We used the exactRankTests, corrplot, tidyverse, magrittr, ordinal, car, and ggplot2 packages for the subsequent analysis and visualizations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.1.">Change in urban greenspace visitation frequency</head><p>To assess the change in the frequency of visits to urban greenspaces (quantified by the number of days per week: 0-7 d) from 2019 to 2020, we conducted a paired Wilcoxon signed-rank test <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Southon et al., 2017)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.2">Relationship between the SUBI and urban greenspace use</head><p>We employed ordinal logit regression models to analyze the relationships between the frequency of use of urban greenspace types (measured by the frequency of visits to urban greenspaces weighted by the percentage of visits to each type of urban greenspace) and subjective well-being status (assessed on a five-point Likert scale: 1 = very unhealthy, 5 = very healthy). This analysis accounted for potential confounding factors, including age, income, frequency of alcohol consumption, frequency of smoking, percentage of green cover around participants' residential areas, marital status, parental status, and sex. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">4</ref> lists the variables used in these models. Quantitative explanatory variables were standardized to have a zero mean and unit variance prior to analysis. Correlations between the explanatory variables were measured, and we confirmed that there were no multicollinearity problems (the correlation coefficients for all pairs of explanatory variables were less than 0.7). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Participants' characteristics</head><p>In total, 1,000 participants answered the online questionnaire. Incomplete responses were excluded, and 885 complete responses were used (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">5</ref>).  The frequency of visits to urban greenspaces was significantly higher in 2019 than that in 2020 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref>; P &lt; 0.001), and the number of visitors to each type of urban greenspace decreased from 2019 to 2020 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref>).  The distribution of visitation purposes across each type of urban greenspace did not significantly differ between 2019 and 2020 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref>). Most urban greenspace types (small pocket parks, large parks, greenspaces along streets, and greenspaces around temples and shrines) were predominantly visited for purposes, such as "exercise," "rest," and "viewing sceneries." Many individuals visited gardens and greenspaces around temples and shrines to view nature; "appreciating flora and fauna" and "viewing sceneries." A distinctive feature of the purpose of school visitations was the emphasis on social interaction, particularly in relation to "events" and "volunteer work," in comparison to other types of greenspaces.</p><p>Among all greenspace types, "pet walking" was particularly prevalent for visitations to greenspaces along streets. The percentage of participants who visited urban greenspaces for "light meals" or "socializing" was consistently low across the greenspace types. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Relationship between the SUBI and the use of urban greenspace types</head><p>Regarding the mental health and well-being categories, we observed a significant positive correlation between the subjective well-being concerning "Life Enjoyment" and "Manage</p><p>Adversity" and the frequency of visits to greenspaces along streets (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref>; Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">S1</ref>).</p><p>Although these positive effects were detected in both 2019 and 2020, the effect size tended to be greater in 2020. In 2019, the subjective well-being concerning "Tolerance to Anxiety and Nervousness" and "Expectations for the Future" were significantly positively correlated with the frequency of visits to school greenspaces.</p><p>Regarding the social health and well-being categories, we observed a significant positive correlation between the subjective well-being concerning "Care from Others" and "Family Togetherness" and the frequency of visits to greenspaces along streets in 2020 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref>; Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">S1</ref>). We also revealed that the subjective well-being regarding "Friendship" was significantly positively correlated with the frequency of visits to small pocket parks in 2019 and that to school greenspaces in 2020.</p><p>In the categories of physical health and well-being, we did not observe any significant positive correlation between subjective well-being and the frequency of visits to urban greenspace types (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref>, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">S1</ref>). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Decreased frequency of visits to urban greenspaces during the COVID-19 pandemic</head><p>The frequency of visits to urban greenspaces was lower in 2020 (during the COVID-19 pandemic) than that in 2019 (before the COVID-19 pandemic) (Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref>). This is consistent with the results of previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Larson et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Ugolini et al., 2021)</ref>, in which an online survey was used, as in our study <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Geng et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Lu et al., 2021)</ref>. We suggest that visitation to urban greenspaces was curtailed to varying degrees under the state of emergency during the COVID-19 pandemic, which urged individuals to avoid non-urgent outings. Under the state of emergency, certain urban greenspaces, such as public gardens and university campuses, were enclosed with fences and gates <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Yamazaki et al., 2021)</ref>. Such restricted use of urban greenspaces, especially during the state of emergency in 2020, may have reduced the frequency of visits to urban greenspaces in 2020 compared with that in 2019.</p><p>However, previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Geng et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Lu et al., 2021)</ref> have reported contrasting results. Most previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Geng et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Lu et al., 2021)</ref> that demonstrated an increase in the frequency of visits to urban greenspaces after the COVID-19 pandemic compared with immediately before the COVID-19 pandemic used data based on social media (such as Instagram) and mobility reports (Google Community Mobility Reports) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Geng et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Lu et al., 2021)</ref>. First, the number of posts on social media may have increased after the COVID-19 pandemic because individuals in Japan tended to stay at home and had more time to use social media <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Tuck &amp; Thompson, 2021)</ref>. Accordingly, detecting the frequency of visits to urban greenspaces based on social media sources may be inherently biased because of differences in the number of social media posts before and after the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>Caution should be exercised when data based on mobility reports are used to compare the frequency of visits to urban greenspaces. In particular, there is seasonality in the frequency of visits to greenspaces; therefore, comparing such a frequency immediately after the COVID-19 pandemic (in warmer climates) with that immediately before the COVID-19 pandemic (in colder climates) should bias the results. In this study, participants responded to an online questionnaire based on their personal circumstances in 2019 and 2020. Thus, we suggest that our approach allowed us to remove these potential biases.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Importance of urban greenspace types in improving subjective well-being and health during the COVID-19 pandemic</head><p>We found that several types of urban greenspaces were associated with improved subjective well-being before and during the COVID-19 pandemic (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref>; Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">S1</ref>). An increased frequency of visits to small pocket parks in 2019 was positively associated with subjective well-being related to "Friendship" (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref>). Previous studies that have examined the contributions of urban parks to promoting social cohesion have suggested that individuals consider urban parks as areas where they can spend time with friends and family <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Peters et al., 2010)</ref>. Such an argument reinforces our findings, as increasing the frequency of visits to small pocket parks enhanced satisfaction with friends by facilitating meetings there.</p><p>Nonetheless, we did not observe a positive association between the frequency of visits to small pocket parks and subjective well-being regarding "Friendship" during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is likely that individuals refrained from visiting small pocket parks with friends to prevent the spread of COVID-19.</p><p>Notably, the frequency of visits to greenspaces along streets was consistently positively correlated with the subjective well-being regarding "Life Enjoyment" and "Manage Adversity" (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref>). These subjective well-being types are closely related to mental health, satisfaction, and confidence in individuals' lives. Previous studies examining the psychological status of individuals after a short walk along various types of urban streets have demonstrated that walking along streets lined with trees improves feelings of vitality more than walking along streets dominated by artificial structures <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Elsadek et al., 2019)</ref>. We suggest that urban street trees increase positive emotions, leading to greater life satisfaction and confidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Koyata et al., 2021)</ref>. Furthermore, the positive effect on these subjective well-being types associated with urban street trees tended to be greater in 2020 than that in 2019. Interestingly, the visitation frequency to greenspaces along streets was positively correlated with the subjective well-being regarding "Care from Others" and "Family</p><p>Togetherness" in 2020 only. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Elsadek et al. (2019)</ref> suggested that urban street trees not only enhance positive moods but also reduce negative moods, such as tension, fatigue, confusion, and anxiety. The COVID-19 pandemic is expected to have significantly impacted these negative moods <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Cai et al., 2021)</ref>. Thus, we suggest that the mental benefits of street trees would have been more</p><p>pronounced in a scenario where individuals were more likely to experience negative emotions, such as during the COVID-19 pandemic. Compared to other greenspace types, activities, such as "pet walking" and "exercise (primarily walking and jogging)," were particularly prevalent purposes for visiting greenspaces along streets (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref>). While other urban greenspace types were occasionally closed, especially during the COVID-19 emergency, urban street greenspaces should always be the closest and most common nature environment to individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Koyata et al., 2021)</ref>, thereby maintaining and improving subjective well-being.</p><p>Finally, in 2019, the frequency of visits to school greenspaces was significantly positively correlated with the subjective well-being regarding "Tolerance to Anxiety and Nervousness" and "Expectation for the Future" (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref>). School greenspaces are generally rich in vegetation <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Holt et al., 2019)</ref>, and the diversity of vegetation and associated plants may enhance mental health <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Wolf et al., 2017)</ref>. Moreover, increased green cover at school sites can improve working memory and cognitive development <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Dadvand et al., 2015)</ref>. These arguments support our findings. Nonetheless, the potential enhancing effects of school greenspaces on human mental well-being may have been mitigated by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. During the COVID-19 pandemic (in 2020), the frequency of visits to school greenspaces was positively associated with the subjective well-being regarding "Friendship." Considering more isolated and lonely feelings experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic, the relative importance of school greenspaces (perhaps schools themselves) in improving social health may become high because opportunities for social events and playing with friends may be steadily provided in schools (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusions</head><p>Understanding the relative importance of urban greenspace types in improving subjective health during the COVID-19 pandemic is crucial for planning urban greenspaces. Our study demonstrated that the frequency of visits to urban greenspaces decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic compared with that before the COVID-19 pandemic. Nevertheless, several urban greenspace types could improve subjective well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic. By focusing on specific types of urban greenspaces rather than on urban greenspaces in general, this study provides a complementary and detailed understanding of the importance of urban greenspaces in our lives. Notably, green spaces along urban streets were associated with improvements in several categories of mental and social health during the COVID-19 pandemic. We suggest that street greenspaces be the most familiar and closest greenspaces to urban residents, thereby contributing to improved human health through contact with nature, even during the pandemic. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>participants' understanding: (1) Small pocket park: small parks (generally smaller than 4 ha) (Ministry of Land Infrastructure Transport and Tourism, 2008)surrounded by residential areas.
