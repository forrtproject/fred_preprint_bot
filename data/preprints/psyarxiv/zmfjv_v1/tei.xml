<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p>Vaccine hesitancy, the delay in acceptance or reluctance to vaccinate, ranks among the top threats to global health and undermines efforts to control vaccine-preventable diseases. The identification of modifiable risk factors and psychological processes underlying vaccine hesitancy is imperative to inform targeted interventions aimed at increasing vaccination uptake.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head><p>Leveraging gradient boosting machines and thematic analysis, this mixed methods multiple population study aimed to identify modifiable predictors of vaccine hesitance in the general adult population. Predictors of vaccine hesitance were investigated in 2926 Norwegian adults (Mage = 37.91, 79.69% female) during the COVID-19 pandemic, before the predictive utility of these variables was investigated in an independent sample of 734 adults in the United Kingdom (Mage = 40.34, 57.08% female), enabling an examination of generalizability across populations. Two teams of authors independently conducted the machine learning and thematic analyses, blind to the analytic procedure and results of each other.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>The machine learning model performed well in discerning vaccine hesitant (n = 248, 8.48% and n = 109, 14.85%, Norway and UK, respectively) from vaccine uptaking individuals (n = 2678, 91.52% and n = 625, 85.15%), achieving an AUC of 0.94 (sensitivity = 0.81; specificity = 0.98) in the Norwegian sample, and an AUC of 0.98 (sensitivity = 0.83; specificity = 0.97) in the out-of-sample replication in the UK. The mixed methods investigation identified five categories of modifiable risk factors and psychological processes tied to vaccine hesitancy, including illusion of invulnerability, doubts about vaccine efficacy, distrust in official entities, minimization of the societal impact of COVID-19, and health-related fears tied to vaccination.</p><p>Moreover, the media's portrayal of rare incidents as fear amplifiers, and stigmatizing presentation of unvaccinated individuals were provided as additional underlying motives leading to vaccine reluctance and polarization. The thematic analysis further revealed information overload, fear of needles, previous negative vaccination experiences, fear of not getting healthcare follow-up after vaccination if needed, and vaccine aversion due to underlying (psychiatric) illness (e.g., eating disorders) as motives underlying vaccine hesitance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>The identified influential predictors were consistent across the two European samples, highlighting their generalizability across European populations. These predictors offer insights about modifiable factors that could be adapted by public health campaigns in mitigating misconceptions and fears related to vaccination toward increasing vaccine uptake.</p><p>Moreover, the results highlight the media's responsibility, as mediators of the public perception of vaccines, to minimize polarization and provide accurate portrayals of rare vaccine-related incidents, reducing the risk aggravating fear and reactance to vaccination.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Learning and Thematic Analysis</head><p>Vaccine hesitancy is ranked among the world's leading health challenges, labeled as one of the top 10 threats to global health by the World Health Organization <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(WHO, 2019)</ref>. This phenomenon is defined as a delay in acceptance or reluctance to vaccinate despite the availability of efficacious vaccines <ref type="bibr">(DubÃ© et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">MacDonald et al., 2015)</ref>. A key factor promoting vaccine hesitancy as a major global health problem is its ability to reverse progress made in tackling vaccine-preventable disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Obregon et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">WHO, 2019)</ref>. Moreover, vaccination is a key proactive measure in protecting against illness, with increases of vaccine coverage estimated to reduce an additional of 1.5 million disease-related deaths per year worldwide <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Ryan &amp; Malinga, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">WHO, 2019)</ref>.</p><p>The onset of the recent SARS-CoV-2 pandemic highlighted the general public's dependency on the availability of efficacious vaccines across the globe, with the course of the pandemic being interconnected with the existence and routine uptake of vaccination <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Anderson, Heesterbeek, et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Sachs et al., 2022)</ref>. The successful implementation of mass vaccination programs, however, depends on the public's willingness to vaccinate, rendering vaccine hesitancy as a critical problem during current and forthcoming health crises <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Sachs et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Wiysonge et al., 2022)</ref>.</p><p>Several studies have outlined challenges with vaccine uptake across nations, calling for research to identify predictors of vaccine hesitance <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Anderson, Vegvari, et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Lazarus et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Neumann-BÃ¶hme et al., 2020)</ref>. Specifically, more knowledge is needed about the psychological mechanisms predicting vaccine hesitancy, with these processes likely to be informative across different contexts <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Trogen &amp; Pirofski, 2021</ref>). An optimal prediction of vaccine hesitancy would constitute the identification of a limited set of key variables with high predictive power, maximizing applicability and practicality of developing public health measures designed to increase vaccine uptake <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Chowdhury &amp; Turin, 2020)</ref>. Moreover, testing the predictive utility of identified predictors in independent samples is imperative to examine their generalizability across populations <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Obermeyer &amp; Emanuel, 2016)</ref>. It would further be of added utility to identify modifiable factors that are subjectable to change (e.g., risk perception of vaccines) above more stable risk factors such as lower education levels and biological sex <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Khairat et al., 2022)</ref>.</p><p>One promising category of modifiable risk factors are cognitions and attitudes <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(MacDonald et al., 2015)</ref>. This includes beliefs about the efficacy of vaccination in mitigating societal transmission rates, perceived danger of the virus for societal functioning, and degree to which individuals believe vaccination can effectively protect them against infection (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Davis et al., 2022)</ref>. In building models incorporating such modifiable factors, it is important to rely on the existing literature to investigate the comparative utility of novel variables against previously identified predictors of hesitancy, facilitating the identification of variables with the greatest importance in predicting hesitance. Previously, a range of demographic factors have been tied to vaccine hesitancy, including unemployment, lower education, younger age, rural residency, female sex, and migrant status <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Lincoln et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Salali &amp; Uysal, 2020)</ref>. Additionally, sociopolitical and contextual features previously related to hesitancy include governmental trust, COVID-19 anxiety, perceived risk of infection, and social media use <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Lincoln et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Shen, 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Accordingly, controlling for the impact of these known risk factors, we leveraged the large-scale Norwegian MAP-19 study <ref type="bibr">(Ebrahimi et al., 2022)</ref> to investigate the predictive utility of a range of beliefs and attitudes about vaccination, above and beyond sociodemographic variables previously identified to be related to vaccine hesitancy in the literature. To investigate the generalizability of the findings and the utility of identified key predictors across nations, we aimed to perform an out-of-sample replication in a large-scale representative sample from the United Kingdom <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(McBride et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>While machine learning models are powerful for identifying key factors that predict vaccine hesitancy, this predictive advantage can come at the cost of explanation <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Bzdok et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Stenwig et al., 2022)</ref>. Moreover, a general limitation with quantitative analyses includes that the use of pre-defined and standardized measures reduces the opportunity to identify novel processes that may be related to hesitancy in an open and unrestricted manner <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Mukumbang, 2023)</ref>. Accordingly, to increase insight about cognitions and mechanisms related to vaccine hesitance, we supplemented these predictive models with a qualitative thematic analysis <ref type="bibr">(Brooks et al., 2015)</ref> on all the subjects who provided written open-ended explanations for their hesitance. This mixed methods study design allows a more detailed and nuanced understanding of vaccination hesitance <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Power et al., 2018)</ref>. To avoid influence from one set of analytic results to the other and to further cross-validate the findings, two groups of researchers conducted each set of analyses (i.e. machine learning and thematic analysis) independently.</p><p>In summary, this study sought to identify a) the most influential modifiable predictors of vaccine hesitancy while controlling for demographic characteristics related to the phenomena; b) investigate the generalizability of the findings by conducting an out-of-sample replication to examine the utility of identified influential predictors in an independent sample from another nation; in addition to c) provide a more nuanced and comprehensive understanding of vaccine hesitancy through a qualitative investigation of respondents' motvies underlying their hesitance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head><p>The present study is part of The Norwegian , a large longitudinal study investigating mental health and preventive health behaviors in the adult population during the COVID-19 pandemic <ref type="bibr">(Ebrahimi et al., 2022)</ref>. The study was approved by The Norwegian Regional Committee for Medical and Health Research Ethics (REK; reference: 125510) and the Norwegian Centre for Research Data (NSD; reference: 802810).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study Design, Participants and Procedure</head><p>Eligible participants included all adults (age &gt;= 18 years) residing in Norway who provided informed consent to participate in the study. Upon initial recruitment in March 2020 (T1), participants joined through participation in an online survey disseminated to a random selection of Norwegian adults through a Facebook Business algorithm, in addition to systematic dissemination of the survey via national, regional, and local information platforms (i.e. television, radio, and newspapers). This procedure is elaborated in detail elsewhere <ref type="bibr">(Ebrahimi et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">MagnÃºsdÃ³ttir et al., 2022)</ref>. The sampling procedure involved the recruitment of a proportional number of subjects from each region of the country with respect to the region's population size to yield a geographically representative sample of the adult population. Data from the eighth wave of the MAP-19 study (T8; collection period: January 2 to January 14, 2022) was used for the present study, where vaccine hesitancy along with beliefs and attitudes about vaccination were measured. 2926 adults provided data at this assessment wave, rendering them eligible for our analyses. 248 participants (8.48%) were vaccine hesitant, corresponding to the known rate of adults unvaccinated against COVID-19 (approximately 9%) in the Norwegian population around the measurement period (Norwegian Institute of Public Health, 2021). Respondents had the opportunity to receive a pair of noise cancelling headphones for participation. Data quality was further examined using attention checks <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Braitman et al., 2022)</ref>. This was done by asking participants to "Please provide the response "a little" if you are paying attention to this survey" (response options: not at all; a little, moderately; a lot; extremely). 97.80% of the subjects passed these checks, with subjects failing the attention checks being excluded to maintain high data quality.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measurement</head><p>A list of all variables used by the predictive algorithm in the present study, along with their description and coding, is provided in Supplementary Document 1. Examples of the categories of variables used are presented below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Vaccine Hesitancy</head><p>Following assessment practices in the literature, vaccine hesitancy was measured by querying participants about whether they planned to vaccinate against COVID-19 upon availability of a vaccine, with adults responding no coded as hesitant (binary scale: hesitant: 1; willing: 0), yielding the label (i.e. outcome variable) of the study <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Neumann-BÃ¶hme et al., 2020)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sociodemographic Predictors</head><p>The subjects provided sociodemographic information such as their biological sex (females: 0; males: 1), age (continuous in years; age groups: 18-30 years; 31-44 years; 45-64 years; and 65 years and above), relationship status (in a relationship: 1; single: 0) and education level (compulsory school: 0; upper secondary high school: 1; student: 2; any university degree: 3). Participants further provided information about their current living situation, urban versus rural residency, cultural background, and employment status (see Supplementary Document 1 for full details).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Medical and Psychiatric Comorbidities</head><p>Information regarding the presence of a preexisting psychiatric comorbidity, medical comorbidity, and presence of a chronic illness was obtained. Mental health covariates were included using validated instruments measuring general anxiety symptoms (GAD-7; <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Spitzer et al., 2006)</ref>, sleep difficulties (BIS; <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Pallesen et al., 2008)</ref>, post-traumatic stress symptoms <ref type="bibr">(PCL-5;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bovin et al., 2016)</ref>, and depression (PHQ-9; <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Kroenke et al., 2001)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Contextual Variables</head><p>Participants reported their general level of adherence to pandemic mitigation protocols including social distancing and hygienic behavior recommendations, governmental trust, frequency of information acquisition about the pandemic from different information sources, financial and occupational concerns, worries related to self-infection, and fear about significant others being infected by the SARS-CoV-2 virus <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Ebrahimi et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr"></ref> Supplementary Document 1).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cognitions and Beliefs Related to Vaccination and the Pandemic</head><p>Attitudes and beliefs related to vaccination, the pandemic, and the SARS-CoV-2 virus were measured by asking subjects to rate the extent to which they agreed with different statements, measured on a five-point Likert scale (1-5; Completely Disagree: 1 to Completely Agree: 5). For instance, overconfidence in ability to avoid the SARS-CoV-2 virus was measured through the statement "I do not need to vaccinate as I have managed to avoid the coronavirus so far". Other measured cognitions and beliefs included fear of vaccination due to side-effects or related to an underlying illness, extent of belief in whether vaccines were developed too fast to be safe, perceived dangerousness of COVID-19 as an overall societal problem, extent of trust in information disseminated about vaccines from health-care officials, extent of belief in the ability of vaccines to effectively mitigate societal transmission rates, protect against COVID-19 infection, and the perceived health risk associated with vaccinating (Supplementary Document 1). The extent to which the subjects believed in the superiority of natural immunity as compared to vaccination was further measured.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Machine Learning Analyses</head><p>The machine learning analysis was performed by the first and last author, blind to the analytic procedures and results of the qualitative team (second and third author).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Splitting</head><p>To evaluate the performance of our models in an unbiased manner, and obtain a singular list of variable importances, we reserved â of our dataset for testing (test set, ntest = 975) before doing any model fitting. The splitting was done while stratifying on vaccine hesitancy and a list of demographic and psychological variables (Supplementary Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">S1</ref>) to get a similar distribution between the folds (i.e. subsets of data). We used the same strategy to split the remaining â of the dataset, constituting the training set (ntrain = 1951), into five similar folds to facilitate cross-validation for tuning hyperparameters.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Variable Selection and Encoding</head><p>When predicting vaccine hesitancy, we used a set of 111 variables, comprising of mentioned demographic factors and psychological variables such as attitudes and cognitions all measured prior to or at the same time as the outcome (detailed in Supplementary Document 1). The outcome variable (vaccine hesitancy) was coded as a binary variable (hesitant: 1; willing: 0). For the predictors, missing data was retained and handled as a distinct level by the trained models <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Shen et al., 2023)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Model Fitting</head><p>All analyses were run using Python 3.8.6 on a machine running Windows Server 2012.</p><p>Gradient boosting machines <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Friedman, 2001)</ref> were fitted using the XGBoost library version 1.6.1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Chen &amp; Guestrin, 2016)</ref>. All models were trained to optimize the log loss:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">1 ð â -(ð¦ ð * log(ð¦ Ìð) + (1 -ð¦ ð ) * log(1 -ð¦ Ìð)) ð</formula><p>where ð¦ ð denotes the response by person i, ð¦ Ìð the predicted response for person i, and N the number of participants. To find optimal hyperparameters, we performed an inner crossvalidation in the training set, searching for parameters in a complete grid <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Varma &amp; Simon, 2006)</ref>. Due to the sample size restrictions, we contrained our search to five parameters with either two or three possible values (Supplementary Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">S2</ref>), resulting in 108 models per fold. For model selection in the cross-validation loop, we used the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC AUC, AUC for short; <ref type="bibr">Dinga et al., 2019)</ref>, selecting the hyperparameter settings that yielded the highest average AUC across folds.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Independent Sample Replication</head><p>For replication, we used a large open-source study from the United Kingdom using identified variables resembling those in our original dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(McBride et al., 2020)</ref>. To maximize the overlap of variables in the UK dataset and the main (Norwegian) dataset while retaining a large enough sample, we used the data collected at wave 5 in the UK data. We trained a new model to predict vaccine hesitancy, encoded in the binary target variable</p><p>W5_C19_Vax_Self, asking whether participants would take a vaccine for COVID-19 when it becomes available to them <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(McBride et al., 2020)</ref>.

The second and third author separately coded all the qualitative data material for manifest meaning and latent meaning. Based on this, we developed an initial template in the form of an elaborate, hierarchical coding template (8 superordinate codes, 2-6 subordinate under each, and up to 3 sub-subordinate codes, with a total of 50 codes across those three levels; Supplementary Document 2). This initial coding template was developed inductively to allow for open analysis and combating the risk of "foreclosure of analysis" <ref type="bibr">(Braun &amp; Clarke, 2022)</ref>. Having developed the template, the second and third author separately coded the whole dataset using the template. Of 317 coding instances, 282 coding instances overlapped at main theme level (88.96%) between the authors, and 260 overlapped at sub-theme level (82.02%). Where the authors had coded differently, this was resolved through discussion and refinement of the coding template.</p><p>Thereafter, and based on the separate coding and the discussions of the coding, we generated the final coding template, presented as a hierarchical thematic map, consisting of six main themes, 2-5 subthemes under each, and 0-6 sub-subthemes (see Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> for overview).

The distribution of these demographic variables in the vaccine hesitant group is reported in Supplementary Table <ref type="table">S5</ref>. The percentage of participants reporting preexisting mental health conditions in this sample was 17.98%, representative of the known rate of psychiatric disorders in the Norwegian adult population, which is between 16.66% and 25.00% (Norwegian Institute of Public Health, 2016). The quota of participants sampled from each region of Norway was further proportional to the respective region's size, resulting in a geographically representative sample <ref type="bibr">(Ebrahimi et al., 2021)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Predictive Performance</head><p>In the independent test set of the Norwegian sample, the best model achieved an AUC of 0.94, corresponding to a balanced accuracy (with an adjusted classification threshold, see Methods) of 86.27% (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">1</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref>). The model was able to correctly identify a large portion of those willing to vaccinate (Specificity = 0.98) and further a substantial amount of those hesitant (Sensitivity = 0.81). Partially due to the class imbalance, the positive predictive value was low (Precision = 0.48). Overall, when using an appropriate classification threshold, the model performed well at discerning vaccine hesitant from willing participants.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Influential Predictors</head><p>The importance of the individual predictors were assessed based on the resulting information gain from their inclusion in the model (see Methods). The 10 variables most influential for predicting vaccine hesitancy are all listed in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2a</ref>. The variable yielding the highest predictive utility was overconfidence in one's ability to avoid the COVID-19 virus. Post-hoc analyses (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">S3</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2b</ref>) revealed that the distribution of responses for this variable in the willing subgroup of the test set was narrow (modewilling = 1, SDwilling = 0.59), reflecting that most vaccine willing individuals showed similar extents and displayed low levels of this belief. In the vaccine hesitant group, responses were generally more spread out, with a greater proportion of subjects shifted toward having Notably, all 10 key predictors of vaccine hesitancy were cognition-related and attitudinal variables, and a similar patterns of differences in response distributions were identified for the 9 other key predictors (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2a</ref> and 2b) as for the avoidance overconfidence variable, revealing more similar beliefs held in the willing group (typically towards one extreme of the scale) versus more scattered belief patterns in the hesitant group (often with a shifted mode towards either the center or the opposite extreme).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Independent Sample Replication Results</head><p>To further validate our findings, we replicated our predictive analysis in a representative sample from the UK which included a similar set of variables (n = 734, ððð ÌÌÌÌÌ = 40.34, nfemale = 419 (57.08%), 14.47% being of non-white British or Irish ethnicity, 26.98%</p><p>with an undergraduate university degree or higher, 18.12% reporting a pre-existing treatment history with mental health problems). 109 of the 734 participants (14.85%) reported hesitance to vaccinate. The distribution of demographic variables within the vaccine hesitant group can be found in Supplementary Table <ref type="table">S5</ref>. We selected 18 variables which most closely resembled the top 10 influential variables identified in the predictive model of Norwegian population (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">S4</ref>), and fit new models using an equivalent data splitting strategy (ntrain = 489, ntest = 245) and inner cross-validation procedure. Here, the best performing model achieved an out-of-sample AUC of 0.98 and a balanced accuracy of 89.96% (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">1</ref>), outperforming the model trained on Norwegian data. In general, beyond the availability of continuous versus ordinal predictors yielding greater statistical power, the differences between hesitant and willing subgroups was more clearly pronounced in the distributions of the predictors in UK versus the Norwegian sample (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S1b</ref>), yielding an improved prediction. That is, greater polarization in the vaccine-related cognitions and attitudes between the hesitant and willing groups were observed in the UK versus Norway.</p><p>Compared to the Norwegian model, the UK model had a similarly high specificity (0.98 vs 0.97, Norwegian vs UK sample, respectively) and recall (sensitivity; 0.81 vs 0.83), but significantly higher precision (0.48 vs 0.79). Overall, these results revealed that the predictors identified in the Norwegian population generalize to the UK population.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Thematic Analysis Results</head><p>To get more in-depth insight into the participants' underlying reasons and own explanations of their vaccine hesitancy, the open-ended survey responses (n = 52) available in the Norwegian sample were analyzed using a template analysis approach to thematic analysis, resulting in six main themes. Respondents often provided multiple rather than a single reason underlying their vaccine hesitance (an overview of the responses with participant numbers is available in Supplementary Document 2). Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> presents the full thematic map including the main themes and both levels of subthemes, with Combined, these results map out different underlying motives that were provided related to why hesitant adults did not wish to get vaccinated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Using two independent analytical teams and datasets across different countries <ref type="bibr">(Ebrahimi et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">McBride et al., 2020)</ref>, this study aimed to identify a core set of modifiable predictors of vaccine hesitancy in comparison with other variables previously found to be related to this phenomenon. Extending beyond traditional limitations of the predictive paradigm, we further conducted independent qualitative investigations aimed at understanding hesitant individuals' articulated motives underlying their vaccine hesitance.</p><p>Among the 111 variables investigated, our predictive analyses in a sample of Norwegian adults revealed that a highly accurate prediction of vaccine hesitancy can be achieved through 10 key factors. In line with calls in the literature underscoring the importance of investigating the utility of identified predictors across independent samples <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Obermeyer &amp; Emanuel, 2016)</ref>, we successfully replicated this high prediction accuracy using a comparable set of variables in an independent sample from the United Kingdom <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(McBride et al., 2020)</ref>. This supports the robustness and generalizability of the findings across European populations, and corroborates the utility of the identified variables as influential predictors of vaccine hesitance.</p><p>Overall, our mixed methods investigation identified five common domains of modifiable risk factors and psychological processes tied to vaccine hesitancy that overlapped across the predictive and qualitative approach.</p><p>The first domain concerned an illusion of invulnerability, where overconfidence in one's ability to avoid the COVID-19 virus and belief in the superiority of natural immunity above vaccination were identified as prominent predictors of hesitancy. This is consistent with a recent study identifying a desire to develop natural immunity and perceiving not needing vaccination as key predictors of hesitancy <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Steinmetz, 2022)</ref>. The thematic analysis further identified beliefs of not being in a risk group as a motive for not getting vaccinated. This identified underestimation of the risks the SARS-CoV-2 virus suggests a need for targeted communication strategies, which could address these misconceptions by emphasizing the unpredictable nature of novel emergent viruses and the potential for severe outcomes, even for healthy individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Poudel et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Tenforde et al., 2020)</ref>. We also identified hesitant adults reporting that they had taken their own alternative health measures against vaccination, including uptake of vitamin supplements as an alternative to vaccination. This finding highlights the need for evidence-based health literacy campaigns to dispel misconceptions, ensuring that individuals are equipped with accurate knowledge about effective preventive measures and the limitations of alternative health practices in conferring immunity against the virus <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Zhang et al., 2022)</ref>.</p><p>The second domain of influential processes concerned health-related fears tied to vaccination, with stronger fear of side-effects, greater perceived risk of vaccination, and believing that the vaccines were developed too fast to be safe <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Paul et al., 2021)</ref> predicting hesitancy. This underscores the need for public health measures communicating the rigorous systematic procedures underlying vaccine development, even when expedited <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Wong et al., 2022)</ref>. Perceiving the vaccines as potentially harmful was the most frequently listed motive underlying hesitance among the participants. Our open-ended analyses further extend the literature by revealing that some participants were unwilling to vaccinate due to fears of not getting healthcare follow-up if needed after vaccination. This finding reflects a need for communication about the presence of post-vaccination support systems to address and alleviate such concerns, with the potential of fostering a greater sense of safety to mitigate these health-related fears.</p><p>The third influential domain of factors underlying hesitance concerned doubts about the efficacy of vaccination, including doubting vaccines' ability to protect individuals against infection, and the efficacy of the vaccine in mitigating societal transmission overall <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Phillips et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Troiano &amp; Nardi, 2021)</ref>. Given the evidence of the significant role that vaccination plays in reducing diseases and deaths worldwide (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Andre et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">Haas et al., 2021)</ref>, this finding highlights the gap between scientific evidence and public perception of vaccinations across certain subgroups of the population. Future studies would do well to combine strategies both aimed at identifying these subgroups and tailored ways to minimize this gap in these respective groups of individuals toward increasing vaccine uptake.</p><p>Fourth, degree of trust in official entities was identified as an important predictor of hesitancy. Here, both lower levels of governmental trust in general, and less trust in the information provided by health-care officials about vaccination specifically, predicted vaccination hesitance, highlighting the important role of systemic trust in fostering large-scale behavior change <ref type="bibr">(Fieselmann et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Pertwee et al., 2022)</ref>. One strategy that has previously been identified as effective in building trust includes engaging with subgroups through community leaders <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bavel et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Burgess et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Ojikutu et al., 2021)</ref>, in addition to setting up arenas of dialogue allowing for open discussion and addressal of raised concerns <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Burgess et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>The fifth domain of psychological processes strongly tied to vaccine hesitancy concerned minimization and denial of COVID-19 as a societal problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Aw et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Troiano &amp; Nardi, 2021)</ref>. While this highlights a general need to combat pandemic-related myths, a recent randomized controlled trial (RCT) identified that information-based interventions emphasizing personal benefits of vaccination had a greater effect in changing hesitance than information provision pertaining to the societal level, such as the collective benefit of vaccination <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Freeman et al., 2021)</ref>. Combined with the identified predictors of hesitancy in the present study, these results imply that directing public health information toward individually-oriented dimensions such as the illusion of invulnerability against the virus, ways to address health-related fears tied to vaccination, and doubts concerning vaccination efficacy to protect oneself against infection, may prove most efficient in modifying hesitance and increasing vaccine uptake.</p><p>Beyond these predictors, a range of novel processes underlying hesitancy were identified through the analysis of open-ended responses. Several adults noted the media's impact on their vaccine hesitancy, pointing at cases in the mainstream media portraying individuals developing illnesses following vaccination. Given the known cognitive biases tied to vaccine hesitancy which can easily be amplified by media presentations, including availability bias where more vivid and emotionally memorable events are attributed higher weight and are more easily recalled <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Azarpanah et al., 2021)</ref>, this finding highlights the critical role and responsibility of the media as mediators of the public's perception of vaccination. Moreover, important nuances emerged for the unwillingness to vaccinate among certain individuals, including a general fear of needles, negative experiences with previous vaccinations, and aversions to vaccination related to underlying illness (e.g. eating disorder).</p><p>This finding suggests the importance of screening for underlying psychiatric conditions and fears which may relate to hesitance, including fear of needles, with a range of effective psychological interventions available for such phobias (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Feitosa et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Mackereth et al., 2012)</ref>.</p><p>The open-ended analysis also identified a hesitant subgroup of adults perceiving disease, infection, and death as part of "the course of nature". Moreover, adults reported being overwhelmed by the hassle and overload of information around vaccination as a reason for their hesitance, highlighting the importance of identifying the appropriate dosage of information delivery in public health interventions <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Honora et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Voils et al., 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Notably, some individuals reported polarizing and stigmatizing portrayals of unvaccinated individuals as a key reason for becoming increasingly unwilling to get vaccinated. These findings highlight how stigmatizing portrayals can create an unfavorable "us vs. them" mentality, alienating unvaccinated individuals and making them more resistant to vaccination campaigns, underscoring the necessity for the media, governments, and healthcare communicators to avoid polarizing presentations <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(MarhÃ¡nkovÃ¡ et al., 2024)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Strengths and Limitations</head><p>The present study includes several strengths, including its mixed methods approach using two independent set of researchers who were blind to the investigation procedures and analytical results of one-another, the large-scale investigation of a topic of concurrent and future relevance, and replication of the results in a large independent sample from another nation. This replication and the high prediction accuracy across independent samples further corroborates the identification of central mechanisms related to vaccine hesitancy pertaining to the adult population. A notable strength of this study includes that the identified processes related to hesitancy were all factors that are loanable to manipulation by public health</p><p>interventions. Unlike demographic risk factors such as one's age group, these modifiable risk factors and processes can be actively modified through public health campaigns, providing key actionable steps for governments and health officials on the route to combating this health-deteriorating global problem. Moreover, in addition to open documentation and code of the full workflow for the machine learning model, we adhered to open science and transparency recommendations in qualitative research <ref type="bibr">(Levitt et al., 2018)</ref> by including an audit trail of the thematic analysis to document the analytical process in a step-by-step manner.</p><p>This study also includes several limitations. First, the recruitment procedure could have led to self-selection of specific subgroups above others, such as older adults with greater computer use experience. Additional efforts were undertaken to reduce this bias by also recruiting through platforms more accessible through the elderly population. The Norwegian sample was skewed toward oversampling of females and individuals with higher education.</p><p>Our results were nonetheless replicated in an independent representative sample from the United Kingdom, highlighting the limited impact of this skewed sample on our results. The sole use of self-report measures is another limitation, calling for future studies based on electronic health records and objective vaccination records. Finally, while we investigated out-of-sample replication in an independent sample from another European country, the extent to which these results can be replicated in non-Western cultures and low-and middleincome countries remains to be investigated <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Kola et al., 2021)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Concluding Remarks</head><p>This study identified modifiable psychological processes underlying vaccine hesitance which could function as targets in evidence-based health literacy campaigns aiming to address misconceptions and fears related to vaccination toward increasing vaccine uptake.</p><p>Investigating adults across Norway and the United Kingdom, we identified five domains of psychological processes predicting vaccine hesitancy, including illusion of invulnerability, vaccine efficacy doubts, mistrust in health officials, minimization of COVID-19's societal significance, and vaccine-related health fears. Additionally, the media's portrayal of rare cases amplifying fear, in addition to, stigmatization of unvaccinated individuals, were highlighted as other underlying motives leading to vaccine reluctance and polarization. These findings, consistent across two independent European samples, underscore the importance of addressing these modifiable factors in targeted public health campaigns to mitigate vaccine hesitance.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Supplementary Document 2. Audit trail of the analytic procedure in the thematic analysis</head><p>To analyze the 52 open-ended survey responses from the Norwegian adults who had reported that they had not taken and will not take the COVID-19 vaccines, the second and third authors of the study used the template analysis approach to thematic analysis <ref type="bibr">(Brooks et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">King, 2012)</ref>. This method was chosen because it involves a high degree of structure in the analysis of data while retaining flexibility by creating a coding template while working with the data. This template is then revised and refined as the analysis develops. The following supplementary document presents an audit trail of our analytical procedure to increase transparency (see <ref type="bibr">Levitt et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">Steltenpohl et al., 2023)</ref>. As per <ref type="bibr">King (2012)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Brooks et al. (2015)</ref>, our approach is divided into six steps.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Become familiar with the accounts to be analyzed</head><p>In the first step, both authors familiarized themselves with the data by reading and rereading the dataset consisting of the 53 open-ended responses provided by those participants who had chosen to not get vaccinated to the question: "If you did not get vaccinated against COVID-19, could you please explain what contributed to you not wanting to get vaccinated?". One of the responses was excluded from further analysis due to the response merely stating: "No", thus, not providing any underlying reason for the unwillingness to vaccinate, leaving 52 responses. The full dataset cannot be publicly shared due to confidentiality.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Carry out preliminary coding of the data</head><p>The second step involves the first coding of the data that eventually results in the initial coding template <ref type="bibr">(Brooks et al., 2015)</ref>. Coding is done by highlighting anything in the text that can contribute to the understanding of the research question, which was: "What reasons do the participants provide for their choice of not wanting to get vaccinated?". Both authors independently coded the full dataset line-by-line in two columns: one for manifest meaning that was close to the participants' words, and one for potential latent meaning that allowed for the researchers' interpretation of the meanings in the dataset. Below is an example from one of the researchers' first coding of the data (Table <ref type="table">S6</ref>):</p><p>Supplementary Table <ref type="table">S6</ref> Some participants gave single reasons, while others provided various reasons. When giving various reasons, all were coded, as illustrated in the above example (Table <ref type="table">S6</ref>) of coding from the same participant.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Define an initial coding template</head><p>The clustering of codes from stage 3 in the analytical process resulted in the initial coding template that is shown in Table <ref type="table">S7</ref>. Here we highlight that we thus slightly deviated from the standard approach in Template analysis, where you typically make a coding template from a few of the interviews. This has been pointed out as a potential weak spot of template analysis, as one could risk overlooking new aspects in the latter interviews (see <ref type="bibr">Braun &amp; Clarke, 2022)</ref>. We thus chose to do a thorough initial coding of all the material first, to avoid this limitation, and subsequently build our coding template. <ref type="table">S7</ref> Unwilling due to the portrayal of the unvaccinated</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Supplementary Table</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Apply the initial template to data and modify as necessary</head><p>In this phase, both authors independently applied the initial coding template to the entire dataset, while considering whether any of the themes defined in this template could represent each data extract. After this the authors investigated the degree of overlap in their use of codes from the template. Of 317 coding instances 282 instances overlapped at the main theme level (88.96%) and 260 at the sub-theme level (82.02%). In the instances where the authors had coded differently from the template or had discovered data instances where the template did not fit, codes were discussed, and the coding template revised. For example, at one instance one of the authors coded an extract under the superordinate level code "Aspects with COVID", while the other author coded the same under the subordinate code "Risk of side-effects greater than the risk of COVID", demonstrating that these codes needed refinement and clarification. As emphasized by <ref type="bibr">Brooks et al. (2015)</ref>, the initial template should be revised in an iterative process until a rich and comprehensive representation of the interpretation of the data is achieved.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Finalize the template and apply it to the full dataset</head><p>The authors finalized the coding template and applied it to the full dataset. This template is presented as the six themes that are presented in the article. Below (Table <ref type="table">S8</ref>) is the final coding template consisting of all levels of final codes. This final coding template is an extended thematic map of the same version as the one presented in the paper, but including all sub-levels.</p><p>Supplementary Table <ref type="table">S8</ref> </p></div>			</div>
