<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p>Some people experience mood changes when hungry. However, the relevance of this phenomenon to clinical conditions-such as depression, anxiety and eating disorders-is understudied. Therefore, we devised a questionnaire to measure hunger-related mood dysregulation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head><p>We developed and validated the Mood, Emotions and Appetite List (MEAL) using exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis in adults and adolescents in the community, and adults with a history of mental health disorder (N = 1,119). We examined the association of MEAL scores with happiness, frustration and boredom during the frustration-inducing mood drift task, in which participants wait for six minutes and rate their mood every 30 seconds.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>The MEAL showed good psychometric properties, capturing three factors for hunger-related 'irritability', 'low mood' and 'somatic feelings' (RMSEA = 0.03 in community adults, 0.05 in community adolescents, 0.08 in adults with mental health disorder history). Quantitative and qualitative responses evidenced that hunger-related mood dysregulation impacts relationships, work and hobbies. MEAL scores were associated with irritability, depression, anxiety and menstrual symptoms. In the mood drift task, the irritability subscale (MEAL-i) demonstrated a significant interaction with time, such that individuals with higher MEAL-i scores reported steeper decreases in happiness (𝐵 = -0.11; 95% CI: -0.16--0.06) and steeper increases in boredom (𝐵 = 0.06; 95% CI: 0.00-0.12) and frustration (𝐵 = 0.12; 95% CI: 0.05-0.19).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>The MEAL measures individual differences in hunger-related mood dysregulation, is associated with mental health, self-reported functioning, and predicts faster worsening of mood during experimentally induced frustration.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Some people experience intense irritability when hungry, colloquially termed "hanger" <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Monello &amp; Mayer, 1967;</ref><ref type="bibr">Stevenson et al., 2023a)</ref>, and evidence suggests that hunger also elicits other negative feelings <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Swami et al., 2022)</ref>. Are such negatively valenced experiences innocuous or do they signal risk for adverse outcomes, such as mood disorders? This question remains surprisingly understudied given its potential implications both for understanding behaviour and preventing negative outcomes. In this pre-registered study, we report on how to measure interindividual differences in hunger-related mood dysregulation, examine how these relate to mental health symptoms and impairment, and experimentally test whether these trait differences impact momentary mood. We examine these questions in adults and adolescents in the community, and in people with a history of depression, anxiety or eating disorder.</p><p>Studying the relationship between food intake and mood is critical to understanding human behaviour and informing clinical practice. Mood relates to fluctuations in the environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Nettle &amp; Bateson, 2012)</ref>, helping motivate behaviour that increases chances of survival.</p><p>Scarcity of food is a threat to survival and food has hedonic properties for humans. Therefore, it is intuitive that mood tracking of hunger would be adaptive, which would explain the link between hunger and mood dysregulation. Experimental evidence supports this theory. Women showed increased anger, tension, fatigue and confusion, and lower vigour after an overnight fast <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Ackermans et al., 2022)</ref>; adolescents were less alert, calm and content after missing breakfast <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Defeyter &amp; Russo, 2013)</ref>; and animals displayed increased aggression after food restriction <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Edmunds et al., 2021)</ref>. Similarly, studies link blood glucose levels to aggressive tendencies <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bushman et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">DeWall et al., 2011)</ref>.</p><p>From a clinical perspective, the question arises as to whether hunger-related mood dysregulation signals meaningful vulnerability to states of hunger in a way that indicates risk of psychopathology or whether they are transient and inconsequential. If the former, they would be expected to impact daily life and to be a marker of more general dysregulated mood in response to environmental triggers. There are several reasons why hunger-related mood dysregulation may indicate risk for psychopathology. First, many mental health disorders involve disturbances in mood and eating. For example, appetite changes are a symptom of depression <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Simmons et al., 2020)</ref>; eating disorders often co-occur with affective disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Eck &amp; Byrd-Bredbenner, 2021)</ref> and some people binge eat to cope with negative emotions <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Evers et al., 2010)</ref>. Second, hunger may be particularly relevant to children and young people's mental health as they learn how to interpret bodily cues for hunger, via interoception, and how to employ emotion regulation strategies <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Harshaw, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Stevenson et al., 2023b)</ref>. Rates of mood and eating disorders also increase during adolescence, and children and young people may find that their eating is regulated in school or by parents.</p><p>To examine mood dysregulation during hunger we need valid and reliable measurements. Most studies on hunger and mood have used experimental fasting protocols, which are not always feasible. With that in mind, we present the development and validation of a self-reported measure of hunger-related mood dysregulation. For such a measure to be valuable it should be associated not only with functioning and mental health but also with experimental mood induction, such as frustration, to complement prior studies. One frustrating environment in daily life is being forced to wait <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Jangraw et al., 2023)</ref>. Waiting is generally aversive (e.g. the impatience felt when queuing), and one possible reason is that it obstructs the adaptive behaviour of exploring or exploiting the environment. It is expected that hunger -which can represent threat or absence of reward, and can reduce emotions regulation abilities -would make people more sensitive to experience aversion during waiting, as it is an additional signal that the organism is in a non-optimal state <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Jangraw et al., 2023)</ref>.</p><p>We developed (aim 1) the Mood, Emotions and Appetite List (MEAL) to measure interindividual differences in hunger-related mood dysregulation in community adults and adolescents, and individuals with a history of mental health disorder (depression, anxiety or eating disorders). To refine the MEAL, we used an iterative process of exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis (EFA and CFA, respectively), with expert input and participants' qualitative responses. We hypothesised that hunger-related mood dysregulation would show a multifactorial structure with good psychometric properties and invariance across samples. Next, we examined (aim 2) the relationship of the MEAL to mental health and functioning. We hypothesised that hunger-related mood dysregulation would be positively associated with irritability, depression, anxiety, impacts on daily life and menstrual symptoms (motivated by reported concurrent menstrual appetite and mood changes). Lastly (aim 3), we examined whether MEAL scores moderated momentary mood responses during the mood drift task. We hypothesised that higher MEAL scores would predict faster mood worsening. Our hypotheses were pre-registered at [<ref type="url" target="https://osf.io/drst5">https://osf.io/drst5</ref>].</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants and procedures</head><p>We recruited six samples for the present study. The first three samples were adults recruited from Prolific (<ref type="url" target="www.prolific.com">www.prolific.com</ref>), aged 18-30, living in the United Kingdom (UK), fluent in English, with a Prolific approval rating of &gt;90%. We recruited sample 1 (n=202) for EFA, sample 2 (n=160) for the purpose of CFA and sample 3 (n=84) for test-retest analysis (52/84 completed the MEAL twice). Samples 1-3 completed all questionnaires and the mood drift task (hosted on Gorilla, <ref type="url" target="www.gorilla.com">www.gorilla.com</ref>).</p><p>Samples 4 and 5 (aged 14-18) were recruited from schools in England, and tested in groups in classrooms, to validate the MEAL in adolescents. Adolescents provided demographic information through REDCap <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Harris et al., 2009)</ref>, and could skip questions they did not wish to answer. Sample 4 (n = 135) completed questionnaires followed by the mood drift task (9 participants do not have task data due to technical issues). Sample 4 were cluster-randomised to receive a snack bar before or after testing, but we determined that this manipulation did not impact the results and therefore participants from both conditions are presented together. Sample 5 completed the MEAL and questionnaires for symptoms of depression and anxiety. Thirteen participants in sample 5 answered less than half the MEAL items and were excluded, resulting in n = 201. Sample 6 was recruited from two studies run by King's College London (KCL): the Genetics Links to Anxiety and Depression (GLAD) Study <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Davies et al., 2019)</ref> and the Eating Disorders Genetics Initiative UK (EDGI UK, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Monssen et al., 2024)</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ethical considerations</head><p>UCL's Ethics Committee (24867, 28647) and KCL's Health Faculties (Purple) Research Ethics Subcommittee (HR/RGO-24/25-46471) approved the study, and all participants provided consent.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MEAL</head><p>Initially, we developed 20 items on hunger-related mood dysregulation, in consultation with clinicians, and mental health and appetite researchers. Before completing the MEAL, participants in samples 1-5 were asked "Do you think that being hungry changes your mood in day-to-day life? What changes do you notice? Does this impact your work, school, relationships or other aspects of your life?" (free-text response). We coded all responses, and grouped them into themes for mood, somatic feelings and impacts. Responses from sample 1 were used to inform the refinement of the questionnaire. For the MEAL, all participants were presented with the instruction "Please indicate how much of the time you think the following statements apply to you". The response options were "Never / Almost Never", "Rarely", "Sometimes", "Often" and "Always / Almost Always", which were coded as 0 to 4. We collected responses to these items from sample 1. Using EFA (details in Section 1 of Supplementary Materials) and qualitative feedback, we formed an updated set of 16 items. This comprised 15 core items and one impact item. Impacts covered four areas: (1) relationships with family, (2) relationships with friends or partners, (3) hobbies and/or interests and (4) school and/or work. Sample 2 answered these 16items (15 + 1), and CFA was performed. After removing items for parsimony, the final version of the MEAL had 12 items (11 + 1), with three subscales for hunger-related irritability, low mood and somatic feelings (MEAL-i, MEAL-l and MEAL-s, respectively). This final version was administered twice (two-weeks apart) in sample 3, and once in samples 4-6.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Physical health and physiology</head><p>Adult participants (samples 1-3 and 6) were asked for their height and weight, to calculate body mass index (BMI). The five-item hunger sensitivity subscale of the Adult Eating Behaviour Questionnaire (AEBQ-h) was included for samples 1-3 to test convergent validity <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Hunot et al., 2016)</ref>. Participants rated their current hunger from 0 to 100 using a visual analogue scale (VAS).</p><p>The resulting distribution was bi-modal, thus current hunger was dichotomised using a median split. We asked female participants in samples 2 and 3 optional questions about regularity of their menstrual cycles, symptoms they experience before and during menstruation (e.g. increased appetite, irritability; coded as 1 or 0 for presence or absence, respectively) and use of hormonal contraception.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mental health</head><p>All participants were asked if they had ever been diagnosed with or suspected they have a mental health condition. For samples 1-4, the Affective Reactivity Index (ARI) was included to measure irritability <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Stringaris et al., 2012)</ref>. For samples 1-5, the Patient Health Questionnaire-8 (PHQ-8) was included to measure depression symptoms <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Kroenke et al., 2001)</ref> and the seven item version of the Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale was included to measure anxiety symptoms <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Spitzer et al., 2006)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mood drift task</head><p>Samples 1-4 completed the mood drift task <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Jangraw et al., 2023)</ref>. In each trial participants waited for 30 seconds, while looking at a fixation cross, and then rated their mood from 0-100 on three VAS scales (happy, bored and frustrated). There were 12 trials, with a total six minutes of waiting time, and there was an additional mood rating before the first trial. Participants could take any amount of time on mood ratings so we removed outlier participants for total time on the task (&gt; 𝑄3 + 1.5 * 𝐼𝑄𝑅 or &gt; 𝑄1 -1.5 * 𝐼𝑄𝑅, where 𝑄 = quartile and 𝐼𝑄𝑅 = interquartile range).</p><p>After removing 40 outliers; 15 participants who had technical issues with the task (6 adults, 9 adolescents); and the final N for the task was 526 (400 adults and 126 adolescents).</p><p>After removing 40 outliers and 6 participants who had technical issues (all adults) the final N for the task was 526 (400 adults and 126 adolescents).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical analyses</head><p>We ran all analyses in R (R Core Team, 2022), using Lavaan <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Rosseel, 2012)</ref> for factor analysis and lme4 <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bates et al., 2015)</ref> for linear mixed effects models.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Exploratory factor analysis</head><p>We computed a Pearson's correlation matrix for all items prior to both EFA and CFA steps.</p><p>Items which correlated &gt; 0.8 with other items were removed, retaining one item. Any item with correlations &lt; 0.3 with all other items were also removed.</p><p>We performed EFA on sample 1 data to reduce and refine items. Parallel analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Horn, 1965)</ref> was performed to indicate the number of factors. Items were removed according to the following criteria: no loading &gt; 0.4, or cross-loadings &gt; 0.3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Vitoratou et al., 2021)</ref>. Models were tested separately by sex, and items which loaded onto different factors by sex were removed.</p><p>We evaluated factor models using multiple fit indices including the comparative fit index (CFI), Tucker-Lewis index (TLI), root mean squared error of approximation (RMSEA), the standardised root mean squared residual (SRMR), relative 𝜒 ! and the model 𝜒 ! p value <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Vitoratou et al., 2021)</ref>. Models were evaluated against the following criteria: ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>  <ref type="formula">6</ref>) the p value for the 𝜒 ! test is expected to be greater than 0.05. Additionally, the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) were used for model comparison. All models were estimated using maximum likelihood (ML) and unweighted least squares (ULS) as the data were ordinal. As no models showed a substantial difference between ML and ULS, only ML versions are reported.</p><p>All EFA models were run with geomin oblique rotation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Confirmatory factor analysis</head><p>We performed CFA on the responses to 15 items in sample 2. We hypothesised a three-factor solution, which was assessed according to the same fit criteria as EFA. We compared the threefactor model to one-and two-factor models. CFA models were estimated in the same manner as EFA and only ML estimated models are presented. For adolescents, full information maximum likelihood (FIML) was used to handle missing data. After removing items to avoid redundancy we ran CFA again on the 11 core MEAL items. While it is generally not advised to iterate during CFA, we deemed removal of items to be acceptable, as it did not involve extensive respecification of the model.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measurement invariance</head><p>We tested the final three-factor MEAL model for measurement invariance between (1) community adults and adolescents; and (2) community adults and the sample enriched for mental health disorders. The latter was split into two subsamples: individuals with any eating disorder experience and individuals with affective disorder experience but no history of eating disorder. This method for dividing the enriched sample was chosen as we expected eating disorder experience would result in more variation in MEAL responses. We tested for loading, intercept and residual invariance (according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Chen, 2007)</ref>. As our sample sizes were unequal we used the following criteria: for loading noninvariance a change of ≤ -0.005 in CFI, supplemented by a change of ≥ 0.010 in RMSEA or a change of ≥ 0.025 in SRMR; and for intercept and residual noninvariance the last criterion becomes a change of ≥ 0.005 in SRMR.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample characteristics</head><p>Demographic information is presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. Community adult samples were balanced for sex, whereas there were more males in sample 5 and more females in sample 6. A majority of adult participants had diagnosed or self-diagnosed mental health conditions, present or past. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MEAL factor analysis</head><p>We used EFA to iteratively develop the MEAL (Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">S1-10</ref>, Section 1 of Supplementary Materials). Based on qualitative feedback (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">S14</ref> in Section 2 of Supplementary Materials)</p><p>from sample 1, we developed additional items and modified wording of some items. Regarding low mood, we removed "I get more sad than other people I know", and added "I become tearful or weepy". A theme of somatic feelings emerged, with 29% of participants citing a range of sensations (e.g. "having less energy", "feel weak and faint", "physical issues like a headache or feeling sick"). We also simplified some language, e.g. "I have more arguments with people or snap at people more" was changed to "I argue or snap at people more". 102 (52%) participants noted that hunger impacts their work, relationships or other activities (e.g. "I concentrate less and am probably less productive", "[hunger] can impact me in social situations as I'm not as friendly as I would like"). Thus, we added the impact question.</p><p>We hypothesised a three-factor model of MEAL-i, MEAL-l and MEAL-s for CFA (details in Section 1 of Supplementary Materials; Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">S11-13</ref>). The model fit with 11 items was excellent (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>, CFI = 1, TLI = 0.99, RMSEA = 0.03, SRMR = 0.03, relative 𝜒 ! = 1.12 and 𝜒 ! = 46.03 [p = 0.272]). The three-factor model fit more closely than either a one-or two-factor model. The internal consistency and test-retest reliability were also good (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>). The observed Pearson's rs between factors were: 0.77 for MEAL-i and MEAL-l, 0.63 for MEAL-i and MEALs, and 0.74 for MEAL-l and MEAL-s. MEAL scores showed a large correlation with AEBQ hunger sensitivity (Pearson's r = 0.71, p &lt; 0.001), demonstrating convergent validity. The impact question is included in the MEAL questionnaire but not the factor structure or sum score. # = Order of items when presenting the MEAL, Est = factor loading for each item in the three-factor CFA model, alpha = Cronbach's alpha for measuring internal consistency, ICC = intraclass correlation coefficient for measuring test-retest reliability over a two-week period, 95%CIs = 95% confidence intervals. Community adults n for Est and alpha was 160, for ICC was 52; community adolescents n was 336 (135 + 201); enriched sample n was 337</p><p>The three-factor model showed good fit in adolescents (CFI = 0.97, TLI = 0.96, RMSEA = 0.05, SRMR = 0.04, relative 𝜒 ! = 1.95, the model 𝜒 ! = 79.99 [p &lt; 0.001]). The significant 𝜒 ! was the only fit statistic which did not meet its criterion. We demonstrated loading, intercept and residual invariance between community adults and adolescents.</p><p>The three-factor model showed adequate fit in the enriched sample (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>), with all indices apart from the 𝜒 ! significance test and relative 𝜒 ! meeting criteria (CFI = 0.96, TLI = 0.94, RMSEA = 0.08 and SRMR = 0.04, relative 𝜒 ! = 3.34, model 𝜒 ! = 137.05 [p &lt; 0.001]). We demonstrated loading, intercept and residual invariance between three groups: community adults, individuals with a history of eating disorders (including those who also had experience of affective disorder) and individuals with experience affective disorder but not eating disorder.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MEAL correlates</head><p>Mean MEAL scores for community adults (samples 2, 3), adolescents and the enriched sample are displayed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>. Female participants had higher mean MEAL scores than male participants (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>). A t-test showed the difference to be significant (t[692.63] = 4.96, p &lt; 0.001). Age (in years) was associated with MEAL scores such that older participants had lower MEAL scores (𝐵 = -0.11, p &lt;0.001; adjusted 𝑅 ! = 0.03, F(1), (878) = 32.43, p &lt;0.001).</p><p>In the community adults and adolescent samples correlations between MEAL and its subscales with irritability, depression and anxiety symptoms ranged from small (r = 0.27 for MEAL-s and irritability in adolescents) to large (r = 0.55 for MEAL and anxiety in community adults;</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>). One correlation, between the MEAL-l and irritability in adolescents, was not significant (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>).</p><p>MEAL scores were lower in the enriched sample compared to community adults (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>). In the enriched sample, participants with a history of eating disorder, including co-occurring affective disorder, had a mean MEAL score of 17.74 (SD = 9.54); and those with a history of affective disorder had a mean MEAL score of 14.82 (SD = 8.88). After controlling for sex and age, a linear model showed differences between the community adults and enriched sample to be nonsignificant (model adjusted 𝑅 ! = 0.1, F(3), (559) = 15.99 [p &lt; 0.001]).</p><p>In exploratory analysis, BMI did not significantly explain further variation in MEAL scores (𝐵 = -0.05, p = 0.379, F(3),(537) = 20.9). Independent samples t-tests showed that neither regularity of periods (t[108] = 0.89, p = 0.373) or use of hormonal contraception (t[108] = -0.15, p = 0.879)</p><p>were associated with MEAL scores. The number of symptoms experienced before or during menstruation was significantly associated with MEAL scores (𝐵 = 2.22, p &lt;0.001; adjusted 𝑅 ! = 0.09, F(1), (108) = 11.46, p &lt;0.001). Additionally, higher MEAL scores were associated with reporting increased appetite before or during menstruation (mean = 24.67) compared to no appetite increase (mean = 17.86, t[108] = -2.88, p = 0.005).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MEAL impact analysis</head><p>We defined substantial impacts as response categories "often" and "always/almost always" and see that community adults report the greatest impacts on school/work (25%). For adolescents we see the greatest impacts on hobbies/interests and school/work (both about 26%). In the enriched sample, more people (15.8%) endorsed hobbies/interests than other impacts. See section 3 of the Supplementary Materials for further analyses of impacts. ANOVAs testing associations between MEAL score and each impact area were significant (all p &lt; 0.001). Scheffe's tests revealed that the comparisons between the first four levels (comparisons: 1-0, 2-1, 3-2) were significant for all impact areas (p &lt; 0.001). The comparison between the final two levels (4-3), was only significant for hobbies/interests (p = 0.011).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MEAL-i and task-based mood drift</head><p>As expected, happiness decreased and frustration and boredom increased during the mood drift task. MEAL-i demonstrated a significant interaction with time for happiness, boredom and frustration (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref>). Significant associations were in the expected directions, such that higher MEAL-i scores were associated with a steeper decline in happiness and steeper increases in boredom and frustration. MEAL-i was associated with significantly lower initial happiness, and higher initial boredom and frustration (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>). Current state hunger showed main effect associations with all three mood states, but was not associated with the steepness of mood slopes. Similarly, none of the ARI, PHQ-8 or GAD-7 moderated the steepness of the mood slopes. Details of these analyses are in section 4 of the Supplementary Materials (Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">S18-21</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>We demonstrated that the MEAL can measure individual differences in hunger-related mood dysregulation, showing good psychometric properties in community adults, community adolescents and individuals with past/current psychiatric disorders. MEAL scores were associated with symptoms of irritability, depression and anxiety. A sizable minority of participants (8.9-26.6%) endorsed that hunger-related mood dysregulation substantially impacted them. This finding was supported by qualitative responses (e.g. "If I'm on an empty stomach [I] can't function correctly", "[hunger] affects my mental health in a big way, and even small tasks feel overwhelming"). Finally, we showed that MEAL-i scores predicted faster worsening mood during a frustrating task.</p><p>The MEAL's three-factor structure highlights the importance of considering multiple facets of mood in relation to hunger, consistent with experimental fasting studies which have evidenced changes in multiple mood states <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Ackermans et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Defeyter &amp; Russo, 2013)</ref>. It may be that 'hanger' has previously received more attention because it is more likely to be externalised, compared to low mood or somatic feelings.</p><p>Females and younger participants scored higher than males and older participants on the MEAL, respectively. The pattern of sex differences on the MEAL is in keeping with response trends on self-rated irritability <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Vidal-Ribas et al., 2023)</ref>, depression <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Thibodeau &amp; Asmundson, 2014)</ref> and anxiety <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Spitzer et al., 2006)</ref> symptom scales. These sex differences may be driven by a combination of physiology, environmental risk factors, socialisation and methodological features <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Patalay &amp; Demkowicz, 2023)</ref>. The trend of FAMIN declining with age may be partially explained by adolescence being a time of high energy requirements <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Das et al., 2017)</ref>, whereas older age is associated with appetite decline <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Giezenaar et al., 2016)</ref>. The association of menstrual cycle symptoms with the MEAL suggests a role of hormonal fluctuations in hungerrelated mood dysregulation.</p><p>We also demonstrated the association of hunger-related mood dysregulation to mental health. In community adults, MEAL scores showed correlations with irritability, depression and anxiety;</p><p>while in adolescents it showed small correlations with irritability and moderate correlations with the depression and anxiety. These associations could represent hunger-related mood dysregulation being a risk factor for poor mental health, although longitudinal designs would be required to test this pathway explicitly. The slightly lower scores in the affective disorder subgroup was surprising given the correlations above, as well as observations of appetite changes in depression <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Simmons et al., 2020)</ref>. The lack of statistical differences in MEAL scores between community adults and the subgroup with history of eating disorder experience was less surprising as food restriction may induce feelings of satisfaction for some people with anorexia nervosa.</p><p>We also show that the MEAL captures impairment in people's everyday lives, particularly their inter-personal relationships, indicating further that hunger-related mood dysregulation is not simply a transient and innocuous phenomenon. Previous work showed a link between blood glucose and intermarital conflict <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bushman et al., 2014)</ref>, but did not test whether hunger-related mood dysregulation mediated this. Participants referenced difficulty focussing at work or school in qualitative feedback. Therefore, hunger-related mood dysregulation may pose a particular risk in settings where meals are regulated such as schools <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Afridi et al., 2019)</ref>, shift work <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Heath et al., 2019)</ref> and prisons <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Kushmerick-McCune et al., 2024)</ref>.</p><p>We demonstrated that the MEAL-i captures sensitivity to environmental changes as MEAL-i scores moderated the extent of mood decline during a frustrating waiting task <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Jangraw et al., 2023)</ref>. As expected, our results show that elevated MEAL-i scores were associated with more negative mood ratings, and faster mood declines in response to the task, which makes MEAL-i a valuable tool for researching mechanisms of mood dysregulation. Other measures -irritability, depression and anxiety symptoms -did not show associations with steepness of mood slopes, suggesting the MEAL is somewhat unique in capturing susceptibility to mood dysregulation in response to environmental triggers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Strengths and limitations</head><p>This pre-registered study has several notable strengths including replication in multiple samples; statistical power and rigorous evaluation of generalisability across samples; experimental validation; and the inclusion of participants' qualitative feedback in item generation for the MEAL.</p><p>There were also some limitations to consider. High correlations between factors could suggest redundancy within the questionnaire. However, we did not address this further as the constructs are expected to be related, and the three-factor model fit the data better than one-or two-factor models. As this study is cross-sectional our causal inference is limited.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Future research</head><p>Longitudinal designs and embedding the MEAL as a screener in experimental studies would allow exploration of whether hunger-related mood dysregulation is a risk-factor for psychopathology and other negative outcomes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>In this study, we developed a valid and reliable measure of individual susceptibility to hungerrelated mood dysregulation with potential utility for clinical, epidemiological and experimental studies. We consider this work foundational to furthering our understandings of hunger-related mood dysregulation, spanning beyond 'hanger' to various mood states, and to mental health symptoms and impacts in daily life. Parallel analysis on the remaining 16 items indicated that a model with 3 factors would be appropriate (adjusted Eigenvalues &gt; 0). We also tested models with four and five factors for thoroughness, but these both had factors which were unsuitable (i.e. uninterpretable based on content of items). Only the results of models with one to three factors are described here, for brevity.</p><p>According to EFA on 16 items, the three-factor model had the best fit with lower AIC, BIC and RMSEA than the one-or two-factor models, although the 𝜒 !

Leaving 13 items (12 core items + 1 impact item).</p><p>On the 12 items, the observed Pearson's rs between the factors were: 0.77 for MEAL-i and MEAL-l, 0.71 for MEAL-i and MEAL-s, and 0.76 for MEAL-l and MEAL-s (all p &lt; 0.001). To minimise redundancy, factor correlations were re-calculated removing one item at a time. This resulted in one item being removed from MEAL-s. The updated factor correlations were r = 0.63 for MEAL-i and MEAL-s, and r = 0.74 for MEAL-l and MEAL-s (p &lt; 0.001). We compared this final (11 item) model to one-factor and two-factor models (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">S13</ref>). Model fit indices favoured the three-factor model (lower AIC and BIC), and this was the only model to meet all criteria. The high Cronbach's 𝛼 and high correlations between factors could suggest redundancy within the questionnaire. However, we did not address this further as the constructs are expected to be related, and the three-factor model fit the data better than one-or two-factor models.</p><p>Table S13: Model fit criteria comparing one-, two-and three-factor CFAs on the final 11 core MEAL items.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Section 4: Additional Mood Drift Results</head><p>The main effects of current state hunger (dichotomised) and time were significant for all moods.</p><p>However, the interaction terms were not significant for any model, indicating that self-rated current hunger was not associated with the steepness of the mood drift slopes. It is possible that the study design did not provide sufficient variation in hunger levels as no participants were asked to fast or delay food. Nonetheless, the finding that hunger showed a main effect association supports the overall notion that being hungry is associated with worse mood</p><p>Table S18: LME with interaction of time and current state hunger on happiness, boredom and frustration Mood Effect Group Term B p value 95%CI lower 95%CI upper Happy fixed intercept 57.73 &lt;0.001 55.11 60.35 fixed time (mins) -1.75 &lt;0.001 -2.05 -1.44 fixed hunger -5.29 0.005 -8.98 -1.59 fixed time*hunger -0.32 0.145 -0.76 0.11 random participant SD intercept 21.02 19.74 22.42 random participant cor int time -0.18 -0.27 -0.09 random participant SD time 2.37 2.21 2.54 random Residual SD observation 8.99 8.83 9.15 Bored fixed intercept 48.25 &lt;0.001 44.86 51.64 fixed time (mins) 2.68 &lt;0.001 2.31 3.04 fixed hunger 5.09 0.037 0.32 9.87 fixed time*hunger 0.16 0.546 -0.35 0.67 random participant SD intercept 27.31 25.68 29.12 random participant cor int time -0.37 -0.45 -0.29 random participant SD time 2.81 2.62 3.01 random Residual SD observation 10.21 10.02 10.40 Frustrated fixed intercept 22.12 &lt;0.001 18.98 25.27 fixed time (mins) 3.31 &lt;0.001 2.90 3.71 fixed hunger 10.78 &lt;0.001 6.36 15.21 fixed time*hunger 0.21 0.475 -0.36 0.78 random participant SD intercept 25.18 23.65 26.86 random participant cor int time -0.14 -0.23 -0.05 random participant SD time 3.17 2.97 3.39 random Residual SD observation 10.87 10.68 11.07 Note: B = coefficient estimate from lme model.</p><p>LMEs were run which included an interaction between time and several previously established mental health measures: ARI, PHQ-8, GAD-7.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Section 1: Additional Factor Analysis Details</head><p>This section contains the results of the exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses (EFA and CFA) in order to provide details of the several rounds of iteration which took place.</p><p>All EFA pertains to sample 1 (N = 202) and all CFA to sample 2 (N=160), recruited from Prolific.com.</p><p>The initial list of 20 items is displayed in Table <ref type="table">S1</ref>, item numbers (with the prefix HM for hunger and mood) are used to refer to the items throughout this supplement.   <ref type="table">S2</ref>). Items HM01, HM08 and HM18 were dropped due to high correlations (&gt; 0.8) and item HM03 was dropped due to all correlations being &lt; 0.3 or non-significant. A two-factor model, with 13 items, was then run separately for male and female participants. The female-only model showed significant cross-loadings &gt; 0.3 for items HM04 and HM13, thus these items were removed. The sex-specific models are not printed here for brevity but are available upon request from the corresponding author. Single sex models were underpowered according to the rule of thumb of 10 participants per item, however, this statistical limitation was deemed acceptable due to the exploratory nature of EFA.</p><p>For the remaining 11 items, we ran a two-factor model (Table <ref type="table">S7</ref>) which resulted in a factor for irritability (factor 1) and a factor for low mood (factor 2; Table <ref type="table">S8</ref>). The internal consistency of factor 1 was very high (Cronbach's 𝛼 = 0.94, 95%CI = 0.93, 0.95), suggesting redundancy. Thus, the Cronbach's 𝛼 was re-calculated for all possible combinations of four items to obtain a more parsimonious model. Four items -HM02, HM09, HM11 and HM15-were selected for their internal consistency (Cronbach's 𝛼 = 95%CI = 0.84, 0.9)</p><p>and the coherence of their item content. The internal consistency for factor 2 was good (Cronbach's 𝛼 = 0.84, 95%CI = 0.8, 0.88).</p><p>We then ran EFA for a final time. The two-factor solution on eight items showed acceptable fit to the data according to all criteria (Table <ref type="table">S9</ref>). We also deemed the factor loadings to be good, with no cross-loadings and no factor loadings &lt; 0.4 (Table <ref type="table">S10</ref>).
