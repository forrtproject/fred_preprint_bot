ACOUSTIC SIMILARITIES BETWEEN MUSIC AND SPEECH RHYTHM Music and speech are acoustic signals that are structured and delivered in time, containing frequency (pitch), intensity (loudness), timbre (sound quality), and duration (timing) information. For each domain, the ordering and duration of the events in time is referred to as rhythm <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">(London, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b110">McAuley, 2010)</ref>. Importantly for the current discussion, a major difference between music and speech rhythm is that music is typically structured in time so that events occur regularly, and their onsets can be easily predicted by listeners <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Jones, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b132">Patel &amp; Morgan, 2017)</ref>. In most music, this regularity in rhythm gives rise to the perception of an underlying regular (isochronous) beat, which listeners are able to extract and to move along with (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b141">Repp &amp; Su, 2013)</ref>, and which drives auditory-motor activation and connection <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">(Morillon &amp; Baillet, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b164">Zatorre et al., 2007)</ref>. As has been noted throughout this book (e.g., Chhatwal et al., Chapter 31) speech rhythm does not contain this same kind of regularity, and intervals between speech elements (syllables, words) are not perfectly regular. There is a large discussion in the literature around whether speech can be considered rhythmic <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">(Nolan &amp; Jeon, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b158">Turk &amp; Shattuck-Hufnagel, 2013)</ref>, and a long history of searching for periodicity in speech has proven difficult (i.e., searching for measures to categorize "stress-timed" vs. "syllable-timed" languages; see <ref type="bibr">Burchardt &amp; Fuchs,</ref><ref type="bibr">Chapter 5;</ref><ref type="bibr">Zhang et al.,</ref><ref type="bibr">Chapter 16)</ref>. However, research has shown that speech rhythm emerges through the interaction of accentual, prosodic, and lexical factors, which create patterns of stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Beier &amp; Ferreira, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">Goswami &amp; Leong, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Kohler, 2009)</ref> and prominence (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Kohler, 2009</ref>). These rhythmic patterns, which have also been referred to more globally as prosodic structure and surface speech timing <ref type="bibr" target="#b158">(Turk &amp; Shattuck-Hufnagel, 2013)</ref>, have been shown to aid the segmentation of the acoustic signal into syllables, words, and phrases <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Cutler, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b146">Spinelli et al., 2010)</ref>, allow for the prediction of upcoming information <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Beier &amp; Ferreira, 2018)</ref> and facilitate turn-taking between speakers (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b134">Pickering &amp; Garrod, 2013)</ref>.</p><p>In both music and speech, the structuring of acoustic events in time can be described as creating a hierarchical structure, where smaller event units are embedded within larger event groups or chunks.</p><p>In music, interacting acoustic and temporal patterns create-based on the underlying regular pulsemetrical structures with a metric hierarchy, leading to the perception of strong and weak beats <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">(Lerdahl &amp; Jackendoff, 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">London, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b136">Povel &amp; Essens, 1985)</ref>. In speech, the interacting acoustic and temporal patterns relate to the combination of phonemes, syllables, and words into phrases and sentences that can also be integrated within a rhythmic hierarchy of more and less prominently accented elements <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Beier &amp; Ferreira, 2018)</ref>. The similarities and differences in acoustic cues, regularity, and hierarchically structured events suggest that the combined or at least comparative investigation of music and speech rhythm processing can provide novel insights into perceptual and cognitive processing and sequencing, with potentially shared mechanisms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2.">COGNITIVE SIMILARITIES BETWEEN MUSIC AND SPEECH RHYTHM PROCESSING</head><p>Empirical research has suggested that the acoustic and hierarchical features of music and speech may be processed by the brain in a similar way <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Heard &amp; Lee, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b129">Patel, 2008)</ref>, and several theoretical frameworks have been proposed aiming to better understand cognitive connections between music and speech rhythm processing as well as their neural correlates (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Fujii &amp; Wan, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Patel, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Tierney &amp; Kraus, 2014)</ref>. Here, we will outline the Processing Rhythm in Speech and Music (PRISM) framework, that focuses on three mechanisms underlying speech and music rhythm processing: precise auditory processing, synchronization/entrainment of neural oscillations to an external rhythm, and sensorimotor coupling <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Fiveash et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr"></ref> see Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). PRISM was developed on the basis of previous theoretical frameworks of music, speech, or music and speech processing that each discuss some of the individual mechanisms potentially involved in the processing of one or both domains. The goal of PRISM is to provide a larger perspective that traverses music and speech. PRISM extracts and combines the most central mechanisms discussed across different theories into a single framework, which can inform new research. In addition, PRISM also aims to provide future directions to identify specific mechanisms that could be underlying the effects of music rhythm training in the long-term, and rhythmic stimulation in the short-term, on speech and language processing.</p><p>Among the incorporated frameworks, the following three were the most influential when creating PRISM: the sound envelope processing and synchronization and entrainment to pulse (SEP) hypothesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Fujii &amp; Wan, 2014)</ref>, the precise auditory timing hypothesis (PATH; <ref type="bibr">Tierney &amp; Kraus, 2014)</ref>, and the temporal sampling framework of developmental dyslexia (TSF; <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Goswami, 2011)</ref>. Larger theoretical frameworks including the overlap, precision, emotion, repetition, and attention (OPERA) hypothesis (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">Patel, 2014)</ref>, the dynamic attending theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(Jones, 1976</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Jones, , 2018;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Jones &amp; Boltz, 1989)</ref>, and active sensing approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">(Morillon et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b145">Schroeder et al., 2010</ref>) also informed the current framework. Each of these frameworks point towards different, though partly overlapping aspects of the music and speech/language connection, which PRISM aimed to combine with the proposition of three mechanisms, as presented below. Outlining these three mechanisms and their potential interactions -both for deficits and expertise -lead to new research perspectives for both fundamental and clinical research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>FIGURE 1.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2.1.">PRECISE AUDITORY PROCESSING</head><p>Precise auditory processing is the basis for the processing of complex acoustic information carried in the music and speech signals, notably in relation to frequency, duration, and timbre. It is often tested by the investigation of the perception of just noticeable differences of variations between sounds (e.g., see <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">Niebuhr et al., 2020</ref> for the pitch dimension). Regarding the time dimension, the auditory system can discriminate millisecond-level timing deviations, and even timing deviations that are below the conscious change detection threshold (i.e., at 3 ms <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">(Madison &amp; Merker, 2004)</ref>). This precise auditory timing has been suggested to underlie numerous beneficial effects of music training on speech and language processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Fujii &amp; Wan, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Kraus &amp; Chandrasekaran, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b130">Patel, 2014)</ref>. Precise auditory timing is the foundation of SEP, PATH, and TSF hypotheses, and is reflected in the precision element of OPERA. Both SEP and PATH (drawing on the OPERA hypothesis) suggest that the precision necessary for successful entrainment, which is enhanced by music training (see sensorimotor section below), underlies the benefits of music training on phonological processing and on the segmentation of the speech signal <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Fujii &amp; Wan, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Tierney &amp; Kraus, 2014)</ref>. In addition, the SEP hypothesis suggests that the enhanced precision to process the sound envelope of a music signal can also benefit processing of the speech envelope (in relation to the overlap element of the OPERA hypothesis). The TSF focuses on encoding of the speech envelope, and a role of potentially impaired encoding in pathology, notably in line with the findings that children with developmental dyslexia are impaired in precise tracking of the speech envelope <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Goswami, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Goswami et al., 2014)</ref>. In particular, individuals with dyslexia are impaired in detecting the rise-time (or onset) of incoming syllables in speech perception <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Di Liberto et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Goswami, Gerson, et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Leong &amp; Goswami, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b137">Power et al., 2016)</ref>, which requires precise auditory processing and the synchronization/entrainment of neural oscillations (see next section). The different theoretical frameworks proposed earlier therefore point to a strong overlap between cognitive and neural correlates involved in music and speech rhythm processing in relation to precise auditory processing. This research suggests that music rhythm training can enhance the precision by which listeners process not only the music signal, but also the speech signal.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2.2.">SYNCHRONIZATION/ENTRAINMENT OF NEURAL OSCILLATIONS TO EXTERNAL STIMULI</head><p>Neural oscillations are endogenous rhythms of electrical activity that can be observed throughout the brain, and are hypothesized to support numerous cognitive processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Buzsáki &amp; Draguhn, 2004)</ref>.</p><p>Neuroscience research has shown that neural oscillations can support the perception of speech <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Giraud &amp; Poeppel, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Kösem et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Kösem &amp; Wassenhove, 2017</ref>; see also Rimmele &amp; Keitel, Chapter 1; Boulenger, Chapter 2) and of music <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Fujioka et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b124">Nozaradan et al., 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b125">Nozaradan et al., , 2012) )</ref> in a similar way <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Harding et al., 2019)</ref>. The role of neural oscillations is strongly developed in the TSF, briefly mentioned in PATH, and appears to be the neural basis of both sound envelope processing and synchronization and entrainment to pulse in the SEP hypothesis, though this is not explicitly stated. The role of neural oscillations is also essential to the DAT. The DAT suggests that endogenous neural oscillations entrain to external rhythmic (or quasi-rhythmic) stimuli at multiple levels in a hierarchical fashion, resulting in levels of embedded neural oscillations that form nested oscillations <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(Jones, 1976</ref>; see also Rimmele &amp; Keitel, Chapter 1). The entrainment of endogenous neural oscillations to external stimuli creates the foundation for hypotheses about how the brain predicts upcoming information, notably in time, but also content <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Arnal &amp; Giraud, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Friston, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Friston &amp; Buzsáki, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Jones, 2018)</ref>. A more extended link has been further described between precise auditory processing and neural oscillations <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Goswami, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b135">Poeppel, 2003)</ref>, as well as between neural oscillations and sensorimotor coupling <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">(Morillon &amp; Baillet, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b159">van Wijk et al., 2012)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2.3.">SENSORIMOTOR COUPLING</head><p>Sensorimotor coupling refers to the connections between the auditory and motor cortices of the brain, and supports the perception and production of music and speech rhythm. The action simulation for auditory prediction hypothesis (ASAP; <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Cannon &amp; Patel, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b131">Patel &amp; Iversen, 2014)</ref>, and the active sensing framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">(Morillon et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b145">Schroeder et al., 2010)</ref> suggest a tight connection between auditory and motor cortices, with the motor cortex implicated in generating precise auditory predictions (even in the absence of overt movement or movement preparation). The role of the motor system in generating auditory predictions could explain why motor cortex activation is routinely shown when just listening to music <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Chen et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Fujioka et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Gordon et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Grahn &amp; Brett, 2007)</ref> or to speech <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">(Möttönen et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b161">Wilson et al., 2004)</ref>. The role of the motor system in interaction with perception is illustrated by the human ability to seamlessly perceive and produce speech (e.g., turn-taking in conversations, <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Hidalgo et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b134">Pickering &amp; Garrod, 2013</ref>; see also <ref type="bibr">Verga et al.,</ref><ref type="bibr">Chapter 6)</ref>, or to move in time with a song while on the dancefloor (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Janata et al., 2012)</ref>. Further, adding a motor component that is aligned with the regularity of the external stimulus can enhance the perception of that stimulus <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Falk &amp; Dalla Bella, 2016)</ref>. Both the SEP hypothesis and PATH focus on the role of the motor system in synchronizing and entraining the brain and body to an external stimulus. PATH suggests that motor entrainment (i.e., the act of aligning one's movements with the onset of sound in a consistent way) satisfies all of the conditions laid out in the OPERA hypothesis, and could support transfer between music and speech processing abilities (in PATH, specifically phonological awareness), as well as enhancing listeners' precise auditory timing abilities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">CORRELATIONAL LINKS BETWEEN MUSIC RHYTHM AND SPEECH RHYTHM PROCESSING</head><p>Similar acoustic and perceptual features (i.e., frequency/pitch, intensity/loudness, and timbre/sound quality), rhythmic structures (related to durational cues), as well as perceptual and cognitive processing mechanisms, including hierarchical structure processing, provide the basis for the investigation of potential transfer effects and connections between speech and music skills. This section will focus primarily on reported correlations between musical rhythm skills (measured mostly through rhythm production, rhythm perception, and synchronization to an external pulse) and various speech and language skills. One of the questions resulting from the observation of transfer or of correlations between music and speech/language processing, is how to define the mechanisms that underlie these connections. Transfer effects and correlations have been observed for both (1) skills related to rhythm, temporal organization, and auditory discrimination (e.g., in word segmentation, word encoding, speech rhythm awareness, and phonological awareness, which could be considered as more low-level or direct transfer) and (2) literacy skills not necessary related directly to rhythm processing per se (e.g., reading, syntactic processing, and spelling, which could be considered as more high-level or indirect transfer; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Besson et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Bigand &amp; Tillmann, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b111">Miendlarzewska &amp; Trost, 2014)</ref>. The low-level transfer effects might be based on improvement of fine-grained temporal processing and the synchronization of neural oscillations to external stimuli, which have been shown to be improved through musical training <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Goswami, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b149">Tallal &amp; Gaab, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b152">Tierney &amp; Kraus, 2013)</ref>. High-level language and literacy skills may develop from the more direct transfer, as the development of fine-grained temporal processing skills enhances sensitivity to speech rhythm, facilitating the processing of phonemes and syllables, and in turn enhancing these higher-level language and literacy skills <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Holliman et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b149">Tallal &amp; Gaab, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr">Tierney &amp; Kraus, 2014)</ref>. The review of the following correlational studies is presented with a couple of caveats. First, while correlational data are an important piece of the puzzle when understanding transfer effects, they should be interpreted with caution, and alongside longitudinal, experimental studies that consist of an experimental group and a control group that also receives some kind of non-musical training (see next section). Second, correlational studies comparing musicians to non-musicians cannot focus on music rhythm training specifically, as musicians are exposed to a large variety of musical training beyond only rhythm-focused aspects. In the following section, we will first focus on potential beneficial effects of musical training on encoding, segmentation, and phonological awareness, before moving on to reading, syntax, and spelling.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">ENCODING, SEGMENTATION, AND PHONOLOGICAL AWARENESS</head><p>One link between musical rhythm skills and low-level speech processing is based on the processing of acoustic features. At the encoding stage of sound events (i.e., when acoustic features of a sound are first processed), musicians (compared to non-musicians) show earlier and larger brainstem responses to the onset of both musical sounds and speech syllables <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">(Musacchia et al., 2007)</ref>. Compared to non-musicians, musicians also show enhanced syllable discrimination abilities based on amplitude rise time and voice onset time <ref type="bibr" target="#b166">(Zuk et al., 2013)</ref>, perform better in speech-timing discrimination tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b143">(Sares et al., 2018)</ref>, are quicker and more accurate at segmenting words in an artificial language <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(François et al., 2014)</ref>, and are more sensitive to metrically incongruous words <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">(Marie et al., 2011)</ref>. Correlational studies have shown that (1) rhythm perception proficiency (as measured with a same-different rhythm task) is correlated with the amplitude of neural responses to violations in speech rhythm for nonmusicians <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">(Magne et al., 2016)</ref>; (2) beat entrainment abilities in young children are correlated with more precise neural encoding of the speech envelope <ref type="bibr" target="#b163">(Woodruff Carr et al., 2014)</ref>; and (3) higher music rhythm perception abilities are correlated with more consistent grouping of speech rhythms in adults with varying musical ability <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Boll-Avetisyan et al., 2017)</ref>. These rhythm-related skills as well as speech encoding and segmentation skills may contribute to phonological awareness abilities.</p><p>Phonological awareness is a central element of language learning, and relates to the ability to manipulate and break up units of speech sounds, such as words, syllables, and phonemes <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Ball, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Gordon, Fehd, et al., 2015)</ref>. Several studies have shown links between phonological awareness and musical rhythm skills in school-aged children. For example, in typically developing children, phonological awareness measures correlate with performance in rhythmic discrimination tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b128">(Ozernov-Palchik et al., 2018)</ref>, as well as rhythm perception and production tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Degé et al., 2015)</ref>, rhythm and melody repetition tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Cohrdes et al., 2016)</ref>, and rhythm production skills over development <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(David et al., 2007)</ref>. Links between rhythm perception and production skills and phonological awareness skills have also been shown in pathology, notably for children with dyslexia <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Flaugnacco et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Huss et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b151">Thomson &amp; Goswami, 2008</ref>) and developmental language disorder <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Corriveau &amp; Goswami, 2009)</ref>. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Flaugnacco et al. (2014)</ref> showed that both rhythm reproduction and rhythm tapping correlated with phonological awareness in children with dyslexia (see also correlations with reading skills). Note that the potential relations between "phonological awareness" and "rhythm" abilities vary across studies, and that these patterns of correlation (versus non-correlation) seem to be influenced by the types of tasks used to measure these broader constructs<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">READING, SYNTAX, AND SPELLING</head><p>Music rhythm skills have also been shown to correlate with reading, syntax, and spelling abilities. For example, music aptitude (especially music perception skills) and reading ability were shown to correlate with subcortical responses to predictable speech sounds, and these subcortical responses were reduced in poor readers <ref type="bibr" target="#b148">(Strait et al., 2011)</ref>. Groups with musical training also showed enhanced novel word learning (through picture-word associations) for children <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Dittinger et al., 2017)</ref> and adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Dittinger et al., 2016)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">SHORT-TERM RHYTHMIC STIMULATION</head><p>Experimental manipulations of music and speech materials have shown that rhythmic stimulation and entrainment to music can influence the subsequent processing of a speech signal-an experimental paradigm referred to as rhythmic cueing or rhythmic priming.</p><p>Rhythmic cueing studies involve a short rhythmic cue that matches one-to-one with the accents (stressed syllables) of a subsequent sentence<ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">2</ref> . These studies have shown that a matching rhythmic cue preceding a sentence enhances phoneme detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Cason, Astésano, et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Cason &amp; Schön, 2012)</ref>, and can enhance the neural response to a subsequent sentence <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Falk et al., 2017)</ref> compared to an irregular, mis-matching cue. This effect can be enhanced by simultaneous movement (e.g., tapping along, <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Falk &amp; Dalla Bella, 2016)</ref> and can also influence sentence repetition performance of hearingimpaired children <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Cason, Hidalgo, et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Rhythmic priming studies involve a longer rhythmic prime, typically 30 seconds, followed by a set of naturally spoken sentences. Such rhythmic priming experiments have shown that children and adults perform better at grammaticality judgements for auditorily presented sentences when presented after regular rhythmic primes compared to after irregular rhythmic primes or other control conditions <ref type="bibr">(Canette, Lalitte, et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Chern et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Fiveash et al., 2020)</ref>. This effect has also been observed for children with dyslexia and developmental language disorder <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bedoin et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Ladányi et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b138">Przybylski et al., 2013)</ref>, and can be seen in the brain response to syntax violations. The P600 neural response to grammatical errors increased after regular compared to irregular primes for adults with and without dyslexia <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Canette, Fiveash, et al., 2020)</ref>. Rhythmic priming also reinstated the P600 response for patients with basal ganglia lesions <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">(Kotz et al., 2005)</ref>, who typically do not show this response <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">(Kotz et al., 2003)</ref>. In addition to grammatical error detection, recent research has shown a rhythmic priming effect for sentence repetition in children with and without developmental language disorder <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Fiveash, Ladányi, et al., 2023)</ref>. These results show that in the short-term, listening to a regular music rhythm with a strong metrical structure can improve the processing of the less regular speech signal in typically developing children and adults, as well as individuals with neurodevelopmental language disorders.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">LONG-TERM MUSIC (RHYTHM) TRAINING</head><p>Experimentally controlled music (rhythm) training studies have shown that speech and language abilities (especially speech rhythm processing and phonological awareness) can be enhanced following music training<ref type="foot" target="#foot_3">3</ref> . For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b165">Zhao and Kuhl (2016)</ref> showed that musical activities focusing on temporal structures (12 sessions over a four-week period) enhanced nine-month-old infants' sensitivity to the temporal structure of speech (and music), as measured by the neural response to rhythmic structural violations. A longitudinal study over two years showed that music training resulted in increased speech segmentation skills of eight-year-old children <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(François et al., 2013</ref>, see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Chobert et al., 2014</ref> for a follow-up).</p><p>Other studies have reported that groups following experimentally implemented music training programs showed enhanced phonological awareness. For example, music training for 30 minutes a week over four months enhanced phoneme-segmentation fluency in kindergarten children <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Gromko, 2005)</ref>. In 4-6 year old children, both music and phonological training, but not sports training, improved phonological awareness <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Degé &amp; Schwarzer, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b133">Patscheke et al., 2016)</ref>. Several other studies have shown increased phonological awareness after music training <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Bolduc &amp; Lefebvre, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Cogo-Moreira et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Herrera et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b116">Moritz et al., 2013)</ref>. Phonological awareness has also been improved by music training (focusing specifically on rhythm) in dyslexic children <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Flaugnacco et al., 2015</ref>, see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Bonacina et al., 2015)</ref>. These studies have also shown that the rhythmic training improved the dyslexic children's reading performance, an effect that has been similarly shown in typically developing children.</p><p>Music (rhythm) training has also been shown to improve literacy skills. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b150">Taub and Lazarus (2012)</ref> tested adolescents in grades 9-10 (approximately 14-15 years old) and found that an experimental group who had 12 sessions of rhythm production training improved in their reading fluency and reading performance. <ref type="bibr" target="#b140">Rautenberg (2015)</ref> tested children in Grade 1 (approximately 7-8 years) and showed that a group with eight months of music training (emphasizing both perception and production rhythmic skills) had enhanced reading accuracy. Further, 8-year-old children who underwent six months of music training (including rhythm, melody, harmony, and timbre training) showed improved reading performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">(Moreno et al., 2009)</ref>. In summary, music (rhythm) training programs have shown promising effects on different speech and language abilities, including improving speech rhythm processing, phonological awareness, and reading skills. Interestingly, the effect of the music training programs on phonological tasks, for example, can be similarly strong as that of specifically tailored language training programs (e.g., phonological training; see <ref type="bibr">Bigand &amp; Tillmann, 2022)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">CLINICAL PERSPECTIVES</head><p>The link between rhythm and speech/language processing has been shown both in typically developing and clinical populations. Critically, research has shown that processing music/rhythmic materials (perception and production) can improve speech/language processing through short-term stimulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bedoin et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Fiveash, Ladányi, et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Ladányi et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b138">Przybylski et al., 2013)</ref> as well as long-term training <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Bonacina et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Flaugnacco et al., 2015)</ref> for children with speech and language processing difficulties (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b144">Schön &amp; Tillmann, 2015</ref> for a review). These beneficial effects of rhythmic stimulation and training are compelling, considering the evidence that children with neurodevelopmental language disorders have difficulty with different types of rhythmic tasks. Timing deficits have been observed in rhythm perception and production tasks for individuals with: dyslexia (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Bégel et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Degé et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Flaugnacco et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b127">Overy et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b151">Thomson &amp; Goswami, 2008)</ref>, developmental language disorder <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Cumming et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b142">Sallat &amp; Jentschke, 2015)</ref>, and stuttering <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Falk et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b126">Olander et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b160">Wieland et al., 2015)</ref>. Related timing deficits have also been shown in children with other pathologies where language processing is not the central deficit, such as children with developmental coordination disorder <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Chang et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b156">Trainor et al., 2018)</ref>, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder <ref type="bibr" target="#b139">(Puyjarinet et al., 2017)</ref>, and Autism Spectrum Disorder <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Dahary et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Isaksson et al., 2018)</ref>. Based on such evidence, the Atypical Rhythm Risk Hypothesis (ARRH) suggests that atypical rhythm processing can be considered as a risk factor for the potential development of later speech/language disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">(Ladányi et al., 2020</ref>, see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Lense et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>Rhythm and timing abilities are multifaceted <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Bouwer et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Fiveash et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b154">Tierney &amp; Kraus, 2015)</ref>. It is thus likely that impairments in different underlying mechanisms (and their combinations) could result in different types of timing impairments, having differential impacts on speech and language processing. For example, deficits in neural synchronization to the speech envelope have been reported for children with dyslexia <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">(Molinaro et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b137">Power et al., 2016)</ref>, whereas deficits in sensorimotor coupling <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Chang et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Hickok et al., 2011)</ref>, and disrupted timing cues produced from the basal ganglia <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Alm, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b155">Toyomura et al., 2011)</ref> have been reported for individuals who stutter. The PRISM framework proposes that designing training programs considering the three proposed underlying mechanisms (precise auditory processing, synchronization and entrainment to an external rhythm, and sensorimotor coupling) could have beneficial effects on speech and language processing in children with different developmental language disorders. This proposal is in line with the TSF <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Goswami, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Goswami et al., 2014)</ref> and the SEP hypothesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Fujii &amp; Wan, 2014)</ref>. The TSF suggests that the regularity of music rhythm makes it a promising stimulus to train the tracking of hierarchical speech rhythm. Experimentally implemented training studies provide supportive data for this hypothesis, notably by showing that music rhythm training can improve tracking of the speech envelope, which should benefit phoneme perception and enhance phonological awareness <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Flaugnacco et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Goswami, 2012)</ref>. Administering tasks tapping specifically into each of the three mechanisms for each participant group and disorder should allow for creating a record of impairments and their potential relationships. This investigation may thus lead to an understanding of different patterns and potential weightings of impairments to specific mechanisms across disorders.</p><p>The SEP hypothesis has focused on applications of rhythm-based therapy to Parkinson's Disease (PD), stuttering, aphasia, and Autism Spectrum Disorder. Short-term, direct stimulation interventions, such as auditory cueing and rhythmic stimulation, are effective in improving language processing in PD patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">(Kotz &amp; Gunter, 2015)</ref> and enhance fluency in individuals who stutter <ref type="bibr" target="#b155">(Toyomura et al., 2011)</ref>. The rhythmic element of melodic intonation therapy has also been shown to be more effective than the melodic element for some aphasic patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b147">(Stahl et al., 2011)</ref>, and providing an external auditory cue can improve gait in PD patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Dalla Bella, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Dalla Bella et al., 2017)</ref>. This research (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Fiveash et al., 2021</ref> for an overview, and Section H: Rhythm in Speech and Language Disabilities) suggests music rhythm training as an ideal tool to tap into the three proposed underlying mechanisms. One goal would be to enhance fine-grained auditory processing and sharpen the precision necessary to (1) process the speech signal, (2) enhance synchronization to process onset information more precisely in an unrolling sequence, as well as improve hierarchical processing and prediction of speech rhythm, and (3) strengthen auditory-motor networks in the brain, which are also shown to enhance predictive processing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">FUTURE PERSPECTIVES</head><p>The three mechanisms highlighted by PRISM (i.e., precise auditory processing, synchronization and entrainment to an external rhythm, and sensorimotor coupling) have emerged from a combination of previously proposed theoretical frameworks. Now that these three mechanisms are clearly stated and combined, research can target each mechanism and/or their interactions to better understand their contribution to speech/language processing in both typically developing brains and pathological brains. PRISM predicts that (1) observed deficits within one of the underlying mechanisms proposed above should have consequences for both music and speech/language processing, (2) observed speech/language impairments across disorders should be related to impairments within one (or more) of the proposed mechanisms, and ( <ref type="formula">3</ref>) training targeting the proposed mechanisms should enhance related skills across both speech/language and music processing.</p><p>This approach can be applied both at the fundamental research level as well as within training programs to better uncover links between neural mechanisms and their relation to music and speech/language processing abilities. Future research needs to better understand how these mechanisms (or their combinations), might be differently impaired across developmental disorders. This enhanced understanding would then provide the basis to develop and propose evidence-based training programs that aim to directly target specific impaired neural mechanisms.</p><p>The current chapter has focused on connections between music and speech rhythm, and done so largely from a cognitive perspective. However, there are broader cognitive and biological connections between music and speech/language processing that should also be considered. In relation to rhythm specifically, the atypical rhythm risk hypothesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">(Ladányi et al., 2020)</ref> has a strong focus on the genetic and biological factors that may underlie atypical rhythm processing and the connection to speech and language impairments (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">Niarchou et al., 2022)</ref>. Genetic building blocks may create the foundation by which joint deficits could occur within music and speech rhythm, and associated individual differences. As part of the PRISM hypothesis, <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Fiveash et al. (2021)</ref> outline that in addition to the neural and cognitive factors covered by PRISM, future research should also incorporate the broader context (see Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>), including: individual differences; atypical and disordered speech/language processing and related deficits in music rhythm; beneficial effects of rhythmic training in the long-term and rhythmic priming in the short-term on speech/language processing; and genetic influences (outlined further in <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Ladányi et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Reward might also play an important role in the beneficial effects of rhythm on learning and memory and social connection <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Fiveash, Ferreri, et al., 2023)</ref>. Intrinsic reward elicited through music (and in particular, the temporal dimension) might also be an important driving factor as to why music is particularly valuable within rehabilitation and training scenarios (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Altenmüller &amp; Schlaug, 2013)</ref>.</p><p>Therefore, optimizing musical reward should be considered when designing training experiments, in link with the groove literature (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">Matthews et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b162">Witek et al., 2014)</ref> and individual differences in sensitivity to music reward <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">(Mas-Herrero et al., 2013)</ref>. One could further extend this investigation by testing whether the beneficial effect of rhythm can be further boosted by social situations including joint action (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Fiveash, Ferreri et al., 2023)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>FIGURE 2. BROADER COGNITIVE AND BIOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS.</head><p>In addition to the neural and cognitive considerations presented in the PRISM framework, there are broader cognitive and biological considerations to keep in mind when investigating speech and music connections.

It complements the more rhythm-specific links related to speech perception, phonological awareness, reading, and grammar (see supplementary material of <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Fiveash et al., 2021)</ref>. Teasing apart the associations between rhythmic/tonal-melodic and speech/language abilities will shed light on which abilities might be supported by specific and shared underlying mechanisms.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Individual differences and development</head><p>Atypical/disordered speech-language</p><p>These theories of music and speech/language processing (PRISM, ARRH, MAPLE), also underline the need to consider individual differences, both in typically developing and patient populations. The perception and production of music and speech/language involve numerous interacting elements that can be processed by the brain in different and widespread ways. Individual differences in genetic architecture, personality, musicality, musical training, musical reward sensitivity, and environmental influences (among others), may affect differently how music and speech/language are processed by the brain. This suggests that future research should also consider differences across individuals and across developmental disorders when investigating rhythm processing and potential effects of music training on language processing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary</head><p>Music and speech rhythms display acoustic and structural similarities that are processed with shared cognitive and neural resources. The processing rhythm in speech and music framework outlines perceptual and cognitive processes that could underlie the connections between music and speech/language processing observed in both correlational and experimental research.
