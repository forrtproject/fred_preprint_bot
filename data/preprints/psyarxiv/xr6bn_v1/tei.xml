<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The effectiveness of error-related negativity (ERN) in assessing individual differences hinges on its psychometric reliability. Despite evidence that task used to record ERN moderates reliability, this moderation is rarely examined within the same sample, risking inaccurate generalizations of psychometrics. A direct and conceptual replication of Meyer et al. (2013, Psychophysiology)  was conducted in 182 participants to assess internal consistency of ERN from flanker, go/no-go, and Stroop tasks as a function of increasing trials. Analyses were extended to include error positivity (Pe) and difference scores (ERN, Pe), and generalizability theory and multilevel models were used to statistically compare internal consistency across tasks. Overall, data supported the internal consistency of results across three tasks in a healthy undergraduate sample, with values ranging from .70 to .97 when examining all data. However, estimates were in part outside the confidence intervals of the original study, and ERN scores showed lower internal consistency than previously reported for a flanker task and higher internal consistency than previously reported for a Stroop task. Pe score internal consistency was similar across tasks when examining the average number of error trials. These findings underscore the importance of examining reliability in each study rather than relying on universal trial cutoffs. Overall, a flanker task may be better suited for studies of ERN due to higher internal consistency of ERN scores when including data from all error trials, However, exclusively using a single task is discouraged because understanding the functional significance of ERN and Pe requires considering task-specific nuances and the varying contributions of cognitive processes, such as cognitive control or response inhibition.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Event-related brain potentials (ERPs), particularly error-related negativity (ERN), provide insights into performance monitoring-the ability to monitor ongoing performance and adapt behavior in line with goals <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Larson et al., 2014)</ref>. ERN is a negative-going deflection in the scalp-recorded ERP that peaks within 100 ms of an erroneous response and is larger for error responses than for correct responses (for review, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Larson et al., 2014)</ref>. Whether ERN is suitable as a measure of individual differences depends on psychometric internal consistency <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Clayson, 2024b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Clayson, Brush, &amp; Hajcak, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Hajcak et al., 2017)</ref>. Although internal consistency is a characteristic of observed data, the internal consistency of ERN scores is often inferred based on published psychometric information. However, this inference erroneously assumes that the internal consistency of ERN scores remains stable across various contexts, including sample characteristics, recording/analysis procedures, and the task used to record ERN <ref type="bibr">(Clayson &amp; Miller, 2017b)</ref>. Therefore, the present study aimed to determine whether ERN scores yield similar internal consistency within the same sample of participants across flanker, go/nogo, and Stroop tasks, which are commonly used to examine individual differences in performance monitoring.</p><p>The functional role of ERN is explained by several theoretical frameworks <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Falkenstein et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Holroyd &amp; Coles, 2002)</ref>. A prominent theory proposes that ERN amplitude reflects the detection of competing response options on a single trial <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Botvinick et al., 2001)</ref>. Greater conflict detection may be reflective of greater cognitive control, supporting adaptive changes aimed at preventing future errors <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Larson et al., 2012)</ref>. ERN is sensitive to individual differences in clinical characteristics <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Martin et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Michael et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Pasion &amp; Barbosa, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Riesel, 2019)</ref> and may aid in predicting first onset of psychopathology <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Meyer et al., 2015</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Meyer et al., , 2018) )</ref> and prospective clinical symptom severity <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Banica et al., 2020)</ref>, and understanding familial risk for psychopathology <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Carrasco et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Morand-Beaulieu et al., 2024)</ref>. However, the clinical utility of ERN is threatened by lower internal consistency of ERN scores found in psychopathology groups than healthy controls <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Clayson, 2020)</ref>. Identifying moderators that optimize the internal consistency of ERN scores is crucial for enhancing the clinical utility of ERN.</p><p>Meta-analytic work examining 189 internal consistency estimates from 43 studies revealed that task moderated ERN's internal consistency <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Clayson, 2020)</ref>. When analyzing adjusted coefficient alphas using eight trials, task significantly moderated internal consistency: Go/no-go tasks yielded higher estimates (𝛼 ̂ = .74) than flanker tasks (𝛼 ̂ =.67), Stroop tasks (𝛼 ̂ =.56), and picture/word tasks (𝛼 ̂ = .27), although go/no-go tasks yielded estimates similar to those from Simon tasks (𝛼 ̂ = .73). These findings indicate that ERN scores from a go/no-go task may yield the highest internal consistency at low trial counts. This meta-analysis demonstrated how the task used for recording ERN impacts internal consistency. However, within-person variations must also be investigated, since the meta-analysis was based on between-study comparisons, leaving open the possibility that non-task related factors contributed to differences in ERN score internal consistency.</p><p>Few studies have examined the possibility of ERN yielding different estimates of internal consistency for different tasks in the same sample of participants. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Meyer et al. (2013)</ref> examined the internal consistency of ERN scores across flanker, go/no-go, and Stroop tasks. They showed that ERN from a flanker task obtained adequate internal consistency (i.e., 0.7 coefficient alpha) with as few as 7 trials and that a go/no-go task required at least 12 trials. Notably, ERN scores from a Stroop task never obtained internal consistency above .5 even with as many as 20 trials included. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Meyer et al. (2013)</ref> concluded that a flanker task may be the best suited task of the three paradigms for studying individual differences in ERN due to its superior psychometric properties in this study. This conclusion has likely influenced the widespread adoption of flanker tasks for recording ERN. Indeed, recent reviews and meta-analyses of the relationship between ERN and mental health symptoms suggest flanker tasks are used in approximately 33-77% of ERN studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Martin et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Michael et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Pasion &amp; Barbosa, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Riesel, 2019)</ref>.</p><p>Therefore, the present study sought to replicate <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Meyer et al. (2013)</ref> by testing within-participant task differences in the internal consistency of ERN scores in a large sample.</p><p>A limitation of <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Meyer et al. (2013)</ref> was relying solely on visual inspection of internal consistency estimates, rather than statistical comparison, to justify conclusions that ERN internal consistency differs between tasks. Another limitation was the use of coefficient alpha for internal consistency of ERN scores as a function of increasing trial numbers, which can be problematic, as the use of coefficient alpha requires participants to have an equal number of observations (i.e., error trials). This requirement excludes trials and participants unequally (e.g., some participants are included in analysis at low trial counts and excluded at higher trial counts), reducing generalizability and potentially altering between-person variance. The present study addresses these limitations by statistically comparing estimates of internal consistency. Specifically, Bayesian multilevel location-scale models and generalizability theory estimate between-and within-subject variance components from all available trials, tasks, and participants <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Baldwin et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Clayson et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr">Clayson &amp; Miller, 2017b)</ref>. By simultaneously estimating the internal consistency of ERN from all tasks in the same model, post-estimation contrasts can then be used to statistically evaluate whether tasks differ in internal consistency estimates <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Clayson et al., 2024)</ref>.</p><p>Finally, a limitation of previous psychometric studies is the exclusion of other performance monitoring ERPs, particularly error positivity (Pe). Pe is a positive-going ERP that peaks 200-400 ms following an erroneous response and is associated more frequently than ERN with the conscious processing of errors <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Orr &amp; Carrasco, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Overbeek et al., 2005)</ref>. Like ERN, Pe shows promise as an individual difference measure of psychopathology but has been studied less frequently <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Hanna et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Lutz et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Macedo et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr">Vallet et al., 2021)</ref>. Studies of the internal consistency of Pe have primarily focused on flanker tasks, finding that adequate internal consistency, as measured by coefficient alpha, can be achieved with as few as 6-12 trials 1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Olvet &amp; Hajcak, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Pontifex et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Rietdijk et al., 2014)</ref>. However, it remains unclear how internal consistency differs for Pe scores measured during Stroop and go/no-go tasks. Including ERN and Pe in the same study is critical for allowing direct comparisons of internal consistency and examining how moderators, such as task used for recording, affect different stages of performance monitoring, which is key for understanding the functional significance and clinical utility of these indices.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1.">Present Study</head><p>The present study directly compares whether the internal consistency of ERN recorded during a flanker task is superior to the internal consistency of ERN recorded during go/no-go and Stroop tasks. This comparison is important because flanker tasks remain among the most widely used tasks for studying individual differences in ERN, due in part to the influential research by <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Meyer et al. (2013)</ref>. Therefore, the present study sought to confirm the findings of <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Meyer et al. (2013)</ref> and support ongoing work using ERN as a measure of individual differences in performance monitoring. In addition to a direct and conceptual replication of the original study, 1 WebPlotDigitizer (Rohatgi, 2020) was used to retrieve data points from Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4c</ref> in <ref type="bibr">Rietdijk et al. (2019)</ref>. An  of .7 was obtained for Pe with 12 error trials.</p><p>the present study extends the scope of analysis by examining Pe and difference score activity (error minus correct).</p><p>Aim 1. The present study directly replicated <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Meyer et al. (2013)</ref> to determine the number of trials needed for adequate internal consistency of ERN scores recorded during flanker, Stroop, and go/no-go tasks using a classical test theory estimate (i.e., coefficient alpha <ref type="bibr">[]</ref>). We expected to replicate the findings from <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Meyer et al. (2013)</ref> such that ERN scores from flanker and go/nogo tasks would reach an  of at least .7 with 7 and 12 trials included in the average, respectively 2 . We expected ERN scores from the Stroop task not to reach  ≥ .7 even with 20 trials included in estimation.  was estimated including up to 20 trials to be consistent with <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Meyer et al. (2013)</ref>.</p><p>Aim 2. The second aim was to extend the findings of <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Meyer et al. (2013)</ref> by conducting a conceptual replication using generalizability theory estimates of internal consistency (i.e., dependability <ref type="bibr">[]</ref>) to determine the number of trials needed for ERN scores to reach adequate internal consistency (≥ .7). We expected internal consistency (i.e., dependability) of ERN scores to reach .7 when including at least 7 trials for the flanker task and 12 trials for the go/no-go task, but not for the Stroop task even when including 20 trials.</p><p>Additional exploratory analyses were conducted on ERN and Pe. ERN scores, Pe scores, their correct-trial counterparts (correct-response negativity [CRN] and post-correct positivity [Pc]), and their difference scores (ERN, Pe; error minus correct) were analyzed to determine the number of trials required to reach three thresholds of internal consistency (.7, .8, .9) using 2 WebPlotDigitizer (Rohatgi, 2020) was used to retrieve data points from Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4</ref> in <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Meyer et al. (2013)</ref>. An  of .7 was obtained with 11 and 8 trials for the flanker and go/no-go task, respectively. We noted this discrepancy in the preregistration and a priori decided to base our hypotheses off the description provided in the Discussion section of <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Meyer et al. (2013)</ref>. generalizability theory. To include a classical test-theory alternative for estimation of internal consistency of difference scores, exploratory analyses of residualized difference scores were conducted for all three tasks to determine how many trials are required to reach three thresholds of internal consistency <ref type="bibr">(.7, .8, .9;</ref><ref type="bibr">Clayson, Baldwin, &amp; Larson, 2021)</ref>.</p><p>Aim 3. The third aim was to statistically compare task differences in internal consistency (i.e., dependability and intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC]) of ERP scores. Post-estimation contrasts from the Bayesian multilevel models were used to compare internal consistency of ERN scores for all three tasks. We expected that dependability estimates would differ between tasks, such that ERN and ERN scores from the flanker and go/no-go tasks would demonstrate higher internal consistencies than the Stroop task when including 20 error trials. We also expected to find task differences in ICC estimates such that ERN from the flanker and go/no-go tasks would demonstrate higher internal consistency (i.e., ICC) than the Stroop task when using a trial-independent estimate of reliability. Additional task comparisons using ICCs and dependability estimates for CRN, Pe, Pc, Pe, and ERN were conducted as exploratory analyses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Method</head><p>The present manuscript is a secondary data analysis of data collected as part of a registered report (https://osf.io/8cbua/; <ref type="bibr">Clayson et al., 2023)</ref>. The <ref type="bibr">Clayson et al.

The current study differs from the published report in that the current study aims to examine internal consistency estimates as a function of trial number to determine whether there are task differences in psychometric internal consistency. These specific analyses were not performed on these data prior to the current project. All statistical analyses and hypotheses were preregistered on Open Science Framework (OSF; https://osf.io/p2hr3) prior to analyzing data.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Participants</head><p>A sample of 205 participants was collected from two study sites: Brigham Young University (BYU) in Provo, UT, USA (n=118) and the University of South Florida (USF) in Tampa, FL, USA (n=64). Each site used the same EEG amplifier system and followed identical study protocols. Participants were recruited from undergraduate courses at each university, compensated with course credit, and provided written informed consent prior to study participation. Participants were eligible to participate if they were between the ages of 18 and 65 years. Exclusion criteria included uncorrected visual impairment and self-reported history of head trauma (e.g., loss of consciousness for more than 10 minutes) or neurological disease (e.g., craniocerebral trauma, meningitis, stroke, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, brain tumor, or migraines more often than four times per month). Consistent with the to-be-replicated study <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Meyer et al., 2013)</ref>, any participants with fewer than six error trials for any tasks after artifact rejection (n=23) were excluded from further analyses, resulting in a final sample of 182 participants.

Data were recorded with a 20K nominal gain and a delta-sigma sinc lowpass filter with a half-power cutoff of 2,000 Hz. The hydrocel net's sensor layout is shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Clayson et al. (2011)</ref>. EEG was online referenced to the vertex electrode and the ground sensor was located at PCz. EEG was recorded continuously at a 500 Hz sampling rate with a 24-bit analog-to-digital converter. Impedances were maintained below 50 k for all tasks.</p><p>Data processing steps were intended to closely replicate those in <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Meyer et al.

Continuous EEG was rereferenced offline to an algebraic link of two channels: TP9 and TP10 (i.e., linked mastoids). Continuous EEG was filtered offline using a fourth-order (24 dB/oct) infinite impulse response (IIR) Butterworth filter with half-amplitude cutoffs at .10 and 30 Hz implemented in ERPLab v8.02 <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Lopez-Calderon &amp; Luck, 2014)</ref>.

Epoched EEG data from all channels were processed through a binary version of EEGLab's runica function called binica <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Delorme &amp; Makeig, 2004)</ref>. Any ICA components that correlated at .9 or above with the scalp topography of a blink template and at .8 or above with the scalp topography of vertical and horizontal saccade templates were excluded.</p><p>Templates for artifact correction included those automatically generated by the ERP PCA Toolkit and those created by the present authors <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Dien, 2010)</ref>. Movement artifacts were removed using temporal principal component analysis (PCA) with a promax rotation, identifying factors accounting for amplitude differences exceeding 200 μV within a trial <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Dien, 2010)</ref>. Channels were marked as globally bad if they had an absolute correlation with the nearest six neighboring channels that fell below .4. On a trial-wise basis, channels with a voltage difference of 100 μV through the duration of the epoch, channels that were flat, and channels with more than a 30 μV difference with the nearest six neighbors were marked as bad for the epoch. Channels that were marked as bad for more than 20% of epochs were considered globally bad. Bad channels were interpolated using spherical splines <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Perrin et al., 1989)</ref>, but if more than 10% of channels were marked bad for an epoch, the entire epoch was rejected. Epochs associated with a response time (RT) below 100 ms or above 700 ms were excluded (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Meyer et al., 2013)</ref>.</p><p>Response-locked epochs were separately averaged for each participant, task (flanker, go/no-go, Stroop), and event type (correct, error). Epochs were baseline adjusted from 400 ms to 200 ms before the participant's response. Consistent with <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Meyer et al. (2013)</ref>, ERN was quantified using a time-window mean amplitude of the average activity from 0 to 100 ms following participant response at single electrode site: 6 [FCz]. Pe was quantified using a timewindow mean amplitude as the average activity from 200 to 400 ms at a single electrode site: 62 <ref type="bibr">[Pz]</ref>. ERN was calculated by subtracting CRN amplitude from ERN amplitude for flanker and Stroop tasks. For the go/no-go task, ERN was calculated by subtracting ERN on no-go trials from CRN on go trials. Pe was calculated by subtracting Pc amplitude from Pe amplitude.</p><p>Residualized difference scores were calculated by regressing error-trial ERPs on correct-trial ERPs.</p></div>

When compared to analysis of the full sample (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3a</ref>), ERN scores from both flanker and go/no-go tasks consistently demonstrated numerically lower reliability across 2-20 trials, while ERN scores from the Stroop task demonstrated numerically higher reliability at low trial counts. The 95% CIs for  for ERN scores from the flanker and go/no-go tasks, but not the Stroop task, included .7 with 20 error trials included in estimation. Interim Summary. When examining the reliability of ERN scores using , ERN from a go/no-go task demonstrated the numerically highest reliability across 2-20 trials. Go/no-go ERN scores exhibited  levels similar to those found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Meyer et al.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p>The current study examined the internal consistency of ERP measures of performance monitoring during flanker, go/no-go, and Stroop tasks.

The failure to replicate the internal consistency of ERN scores from <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Meyer et al. (2013)</ref> suggests that the widespread adoption of flanker tasks based on assumptions of superior internal consistency at low-trial counts may be inappropriate and highlights the need for psychometric reliability to be examined and reported on a study-by-study basis (see <ref type="bibr">Clayson &amp; Miller, 2017a</ref><ref type="bibr">, 2017b)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Direct Replication</head><p>Following the procedure of the replicated study, a visual examination of coefficient alpha across trials indicated that ERN scores from a go/no-go task consistently demonstrated the highest internal consistency across each trial count from 2 to 20 trials.

(2013)</ref>, wherein ERN scores from a flanker task showed the highest internal consistency when including at least 12 error trials. However, relying solely on visual inspection of internal consistency estimates can lead to erroneous conclusions, because uncertainty around the observed differences is not readily interpretable. Therefore, post-estimation contrasts from Bayesian multilevel models were used to statistically compare the internal consistency of ERN scores across tasks and interpret task differences.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Conceptual Replication</head><p>Analyses for Aim 2 indicated a greater number of trials were required for ERN scores to reach an internal consistency threshold of .7 than those reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Meyer et al.

(2013)</ref> found that 7 and 12 trials were sufficient for a flanker and go/no-go task with coefficient alpha, respectively, while 24 and 22 trials were required to reach an internal consistency threshold of .7 () in the current study. Regarding the Stroop task, like <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Meyer et al. (2013)</ref>, more than 20 trials were required for ERN scores to reach a reliability threshold of .7. in the current study, it would have resulted in the inclusion of participants with unreliable data, thereby inflating Type I and Type II errors <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Hedge et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Loken &amp; Gelman, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Rouder &amp; Haaf, 2019)</ref>. These results emphasize the critical need to evaluate and report internal consistency on a study-by-study basis and caution against using universal trial cutoffs for data inclusion. Instead, subject-level data quality and internal consistency estimates are recommended to identify individual participants that show ERN with poor internal consistency. This approach circumvents limitations of relying on group-level reliability estimates and group-level numbers of trials, which can obscure poor data quality of individual participants (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Clayson, Brush, et al., 2021)</ref>. The analysis of subject-level reliability is readily available in the open-source ERP Reliability Analysis (ERA) Toolbox <ref type="bibr">(Clayson &amp; Miller, 2017a)</ref>.</p><p>Analyses for Aim 3 showed that, contrary to expectations, internal consistency of ERN and ERN scores did not differ across tasks when including 20 error trials. Importantly, all three tasks required more than 20 trials to obtain dependability of .7. A well-regarded psychometric text recommends a minimum threshold of .7 for novel or preliminary work, .8 for developed research areas focused on group differences, and .9 or .95 for clinical decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Nunally &amp; Bernstein, 1994)</ref>. Similar thresholds are advised for ERP research <ref type="bibr">(Clayson &amp; Miller, 2017b)</ref>.</p><p>Given that studies of ERN are not typically considered novel or preliminary in most contexts, higher thresholds of internal consistency should be used to support the examination of individual differences. As such, examining task differences in ERN score internal consistency when including more error trials may be more informative.</p><p>Exploratory analyses were used to examine task differences in the dependability of ERN scores using the average number of error trials for each task. Results showed that ERN scores from a flanker task demonstrated higher dependability than scores from go/no-go and Stroop tasks, and ERN scores from a flanker task demonstrated higher dependability than scores from a go/no-go task but not a Stroop task. Given that each task was the same length (420 trials) and that common practice in ERN research is to use all available trials for analyses, a flanker task may be best suited for studying individual differences in ERN based on higher estimates of internal consistency due to the inclusion of more error trials than the other two tasks.</p><p>Unlike ERN, task differences in internal consistency emerged for Pe scores at 20 error trials. Pe scores from a go/no-go task exhibited higher dependability than those from flanker and Stroop tasks, and Pe scores from a go/no-go task exhibited higher dependability than those from a Stroop task but not a flanker task. No task differences emerged for Pe using mean error trials. These findings suggest any of the three tasks may be appropriate for measuring Pe; however, a go/no-go task may be preferable when few error trials are expected.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Moving Forward</head><p>Overreliance on a single paradigm for recording ERN can limit understanding of how error-related performance monitoring relates to individual differences. ERN represents a manifestation of multiple neural generators, involves various neurotransmitters, and is influenced by several cognitive, affective, motivational, and motor processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Gehring et al., 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Consequently, task-related differences in ERN amplitude could reflect engagement of different component processes contributing to ERN. Indeed, ERN and Pe indices measured during go/nogo, flanker, and Stroop tasks demonstrate low convergence even after adjusting for measurement error <ref type="bibr">(Clayson et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Riesel et al., 2013)</ref>. This conclusion is supported by the strong convergence of ERN when examining three different versions of flanker tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Clayson et al., 2024)</ref>, and the stronger concordance of ERN across versions of flanker tasks than across different types of tasks.</p><p>Ideally, task choice should be guided by interest in the component processes contributing to ERN during that task. However, the functional significance of ERN and Pe remains not well understood <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Clayson, Kappenman, et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Overbeek et al., 2005)</ref>, especially in specific contexts (e.g., task), complicating task selection and discouraging the adoption of a single paradigm. A notable distinction among flanker, go/no-go, and Stroop tasks is the way errors are committed. Errors across all three tasks reflect a failure to override a prepotent response; However, in a go/no-go task, ERN and Pe are measured from commission errors on no-go trials, in which participants fail to inhibit a motor response. In contrast, flanker and Stroop tasks require a motor response on every trial, with errors reflecting the selection of an incorrect option between two conflicting responses. Therefore, if response inhibition is of interest, it would be sensible to choose a go/no-go task for measuring ERN and Pe.</p><p>To understand the functional significance of ERN and Pe recorded during different tasks and to inform task decisions for specific contexts, future research might consider "multiverse" analyses, where multiple task features or data-processing pipelines could be analyzed within the same study (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Clayson, 2024a)</ref>. For example, using both a go/no-go and flanker task could highlight whether different forms of error commission differentially relate to clinically meaningful variables, such as behavioral inhibition. Even within the same task, different dataprocessing decisions (e.g., ocular artifact correction procedures, approaches to scoring), could be examined to identify approaches optimized for examining individual differences. However, a multiverse approach must carefully balance the research aims against potential drawbacks, such as participant burden and fatigue. Taken together, narrowing performance-monitoring research to a single task would likely limit a comprehensive understanding of changes in error processing related to contextual influences, individual differences, or psychopathology.</p><p>The current study's findings can be used as a guide during planning stages of ERN studies, such as determining the required task length to retain an adequate number of error trials for the study of individual differences. A task with 420 trials resulted in an adequate number of error trials for ERN scores from a flanker task to reach an overall dependability of .86, whereas dependability of ERN scores did not reach .8 for the go/no-go and Stroop tasks due to higher participant accuracy on these tasks. Therefore, the current task length may be sufficient for flanker tasks but the inclusion of more trials may be necessary for go/no-go and Stroop tasks. The present study closely followed the procedures described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Meyer et al. (2013)</ref> and incorporated input from an original co-author. However, potential deviations from the original study could impact the present findings. First, tasks were adapted to use with E-Prime Software because Presentation was incompatible with the Magstim EGI hardware setup. These E-Prime tasks, modeled on the original paradigms, were functionally identical and are available on OSF for future replications (https://osf.io/tzq8n/). Second, the original study used active electrodes, while the current study used passive electrodes. Although passive and active electrodes can provide comparable data quality <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Mathewson et al., 2017)</ref>, differences in data quality between the two studies could influence internal consistency estimates. However, this possible explanation is unlikely because the present study replicated the internal consistency estimates of ERN for the go/no-go task. If data quality were worse in the present study, worse internal consistency across all three tasks would be expected. Third, minor adjustments were made to the data-processing pipeline due to the different software used for recording and analyzing EEG. For example, the original study used a regression-based approach for ocular artifact correction, but the present study used ICA based on findings it leads to improve data quality <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Clayson, Baldwin, Rocha, et al., 2021)</ref>. Fourth, the sample size in the present study (n = 182) was over four times larger than the original study (n = 43), and sampling error could contribute to differences in reliability estimates. Additionally, the demographic characteristics of the samples differed: the present sample was predominantly White (85%), with Asians being the next largest group (8%), while the original study's sample was predominantly Asian-American (46%) with Caucasians/Europeans as the next largest group (39%). Despite both studies sampling college undergraduates using identical inclusion/exclusion criteria, these demographic differences are notable. Hopefully, recent efforts to mobilize the field to fully characterize the demographics of samples in psychophysiology studies will provide a foundation for understanding how these characteristics can influence study interpretations <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Gatzke-Kopp et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Kissel &amp; Friedman, 2023)</ref>.</p><p>Given these methodological and demographic differences, the extent to which the present study constitutes a direct (i.e., close) replication of <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Meyer et al. (2013)</ref> is debatable. While we closely followed their procedures and collaborated with an original co-author, variations between studies could influence outcomes. This raises questions about what defines a direct replication in studies of ERPs <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Clayson et al., 2019)</ref>. Although variations are sometimes unavoidable (e.g., EEG hardware differences between labs, different sample characteristics), a key aspect of a direct replication is the replication of the core procedures and conditions critical for eliciting the phenomenon under investigation <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Simons, 2014)</ref>, but ERP studies involve many researcher degrees of freedom (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Clayson et al., 2022)</ref>. We acknowledge that some may interpret our study as a conceptual rather than direct replication due to methodological and demographic differences. Although there are various definitions of replication <ref type="bibr">(Vachon et al., 2021)</ref>, a recent relevant definition describes it as a study designed such that its outcome serves as diagnostic evidence of the original study's claim <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Nosek &amp; Errington, 2020)</ref>. The present findings yield outcomes that might decrease confidence in the claims of the original research, despite study differences. Replications by independent labs-even when minor differences exist-are vital for testing the repeatability of a study's findings.</p><p>The present study used the same tasks as <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Meyer et al. (2013)</ref>, but these represent only a subset of possible flanker, Stroop, and go/no-go tasks. Present findings might not generalize to other versions of these tasks due to important methodological differences, particularly those related to stimulus-response ensembles described by the dimensional overlap model <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Kornblum et al., 1990)</ref>. For example, the traditional semantic Stroop task involves interference between relevant (i.e., font color) and irrelevant (i.e., word) stimulus dimensions, both of which overlap with response options: words "red", "green", or "blue" appear in either red, green or blue font, and each font color (and word) is associated with a unique response <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Stroop, 1935)</ref>. In contrast, the current version of the Stroop task eliminated the one-to-one mapping between the irrelevant dimension (i.e., word) and participant response by only presenting words (red, green, blue) in red or green font. As a result, the relevant and irrelevant stimulus dimensions did not overlap as they do in the traditional Stroop. Similarly, the modified version of the flanker task used in the present study has overlap between stimulus and response dimensions, unlike the original letter version of the task <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Eriksen &amp; Eriksen, 1974)</ref>. It is possible that there is an assumption that tasks with the same name measure the same construct, simply because they share the same name-fallacious reasoning is referred to as the jingle fallacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Kelley, 1927)</ref>. Taken together, different stimulusresponse dimensions and causes of conflict in each task might contribute to differences in internal consistency, and systematic examinations of conflict type would help clarify how they contribute to changes in ERN and Pe.</p><p>The study had limitations. The current study is limited by use of a single-data processing pipeline and a single version of each task <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Clayson, 2024a)</ref>, and a single data-processing pipeline was chosen to be consistent with <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Meyer et al. (2013)</ref>. Internal consistency of ERP scores can vary as a function of data-processing decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Clayson, Baldwin, Rocha, et al., 2021)</ref> and task features, even for the same paradigm <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Clayson et al., 2024)</ref>. Thus, results may differ when using other processing decisions or task variants (e.g., different versions of a Stroop task). Although the present study focused on internal consistency, other approaches could be used to identify paradigms optimal for recording ERN in certain contexts. For example, data from a paradigm might relate to certain individual differences more robustly than another paradigm. Relationships with external correlates can help guide which task to use for recording ERN, but this should not limit investigations into the particular features that lead to changes in ERN. Similary, ERN scores might show higher test-retest reliability when recorded using certain paradigms, and future research might consider examining which pardigms yield both the highest stability over time and within sessions.</p><p>Taken together, these findings highlight the importance of task selection in performancemonitoring ERP research as the choice of task can significantly impact the internal consistency of these indices, which consequently impacts the ability to observe relationships with external correlates. The failure to replicate the internal consistency of ERN scores from <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Meyer et al. (2013)</ref> for flanker and Stroop tasks, despite the use of identical tasks in a similarly aged sample, underscores the need for internal consistency to be examined and reported in any study of individual differences in ERN amplitude due to the numerous contextual factors that could contribute to internal consistency <ref type="bibr">(Clayson &amp; Miller, 2017b)</ref>. Findings of task differences for Pe and ERN score internal consistency emphasize the inappropriateness of generalizing a trial cutoff for data inclusion from a single task to other tasks (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Clayson, 2020)</ref>. Once all data from each task are included, a flanker task appears best suited for recording ERN, ERN, and Pe, as the data from the flanker task show the highest internal consistency due to inclusion of more error trials. Despite differences in the number of trials and observed internal consistency to <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Meyer et al. (2013)</ref>, all tasks in the present study achieved reasonable internal consistency (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>) when all data were included in analysis and are therefore suitable for investigating associations with individual differences. Consequently, the choice of tasks should primarily be guided by hypotheses and the specific research question. Present findings should not be construed as unequivocal support for any single task, given the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the functional significance of ERN and Pe and the causes of variability in internal consistency across flanker, Stroop, and go/no-go tasks.           Stroop task. On each trial, one of three color words was shown ('red', 'green', or 'blue'), presented in either red or green font. Participants were instructed to click the left mouse button if a word was presented in red font and click the right mouse button if a word was presented in green font. Trial blocks consisted of 1/3 congruent trials (e.g., the word "red" in red font), 1/3 incongruent trials (e.g., the word "red" in green font), and 1/3 neutral trials (e.g., the word 'blue' in red or green font).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analytical Plan</head><p>Aim 2. Bayesian location-scale multilevel models were used to estimate between-person, between-trial, and error variances for each ERP and task. These variance components were then used to estimate psychometric reliability. Location-scale multilevel models are well suited to ERP data and accommodate the nested nature of the data (trials nested within tasks nested within participants). The following models were implemented and are described here using Wilkinson notation:</p><p>ERP ~ 0 + TaskEvent + (0 + TaskEvent|p|Participant) + (0 + TaskEvent|q|Trial) Sigma ~ 0 + TaskEvent + (0 + TaskEvent|p|Participant) + (0 + TaskEvent|q|Trial)</p><p>Each model was fit within R (R Development Core Team, 2021) using brms, a front end for Stan <ref type="bibr">(Stan Development Team, 2021)</ref>. Sigma refers to the scale portion of the model, and separate models were used to predict ERN and Pe amplitudes. The same fixed and random effects were modeled on the location and scale portions of the model. The population intercepts were suppressed in the models, resulting in the estimation of separate intercepts for each level of "TaskEvent". The independent variable "TaskEvent" included six levels representing all unique combinations of Task (flanker, go/no-go, Stroop) and Event (error, correct). The models included participants and trials as random intercepts and "TaskEvent" as random slopes, and covariances were modeled between random intercepts and slopes, which is reflected by the "|p|" and "|q|" notations. The priors for fixed effect estimates used a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 3. All variance components were estimated using a Student's t prior distribution with 10 degrees of freedom, a 0 location parameter, and a 2 scale parameter. An LKJ prior distribution with a shape parameter of 2 was used, which can be considered mildly informative.</p><p>Using the variance components estimated from the location-scale models and Eq. 1,  of ERN scores were estimated as a function of increasing trial numbers <ref type="bibr">(2,</ref><ref type="bibr">4,</ref><ref type="bibr">6,</ref><ref type="bibr">8,</ref><ref type="bibr">10,</ref><ref type="bibr">12,</ref><ref type="bibr">14,</ref><ref type="bibr">16,</ref><ref type="bibr">18</ref>, and 20 error trials) separately for each task.</p><p>Eq.

The number of error trials is limited compared to the number of correct trials because some high-performing participants commit few errors. Therefore, the number of error trials typically place a ceiling on the internal consistency of ERN and Pe scores. As a result, analyses of the internal consistency of difference scores used the average number of correct trials for each task (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>) 1 and focused on the impact of increasing the number of error trials on internal consistency.</p><p>Eq.

The contribution of within-person and between-trial variances are impacted by the average number of X trials (𝑛 𝑖𝑋 ′ ) and of Y trials (𝑛 𝑖𝑌 ′ ) and by the harmonic mean of X and Y trials (𝑛̈𝑖 ′ ) (see <ref type="bibr">Clayson, Baldwin, &amp; Larson, 2021)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental Tasks</head><p>Participants completed a flanker task, Stroop task, and a go/no-go task that were identical to the versions used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Meyer et al. (2013)</ref>. The order of task presentation was counterbalanced (using a fully crossed Latin-square) across participants and sites. Tasks were presented in E-Prime (Psychology Software Tools, Pittsburg, PA).</p><p>All tasks included 7 blocks of 60 trials, resulting in 420 total trials. Each task began with 20 practice trials. The total duration of all three tasks combined was approximately 60 minutes.</p><p>The order of trials within each task was randomly determined within each block. Stimuli were presented for 200 ms, on a black background, followed by a jittered inter-trial interval (ITI) ranging from 600 to 1,000 ms. Performance-based feedback was presented at the end of each block to encourage fast and accurate behavior. If performance accuracy was below or equal to 75%, the feedback "Please try to be more accurate" was shown. If accuracy was above 90%, the feedback "Please try to respond faster" was shown. If accuracy fell between 75% and 90%, the feedback "You're doing a great job" was shown. For the go/no-go task, feedback was based on accuracy calculated for no-go trials only (i.e., errors of commission).</p><p>Flanker task. On each trial, 5 horizontally aligned white arrowheads were presented, with arrows in the array either all pointed the same direction (i.e., congruent trial: &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; or &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;) or with the central arrow pointed in the opposite direction of other arrows (i.e., incongruent trial: &lt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&lt; or &gt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&gt;). Participants were instructed to either click the left or right mouse button that corresponded with the direction of the center arrow. Each of the 7 trial blocks consisted of 50% congruent and 50% incongruent trials. At a viewing distance of 65 cm, the arrow array occupied 2° of visual angle vertically and 10° horizontally.</p><p>Next, Eq. ( <ref type="formula">3</ref>), shown below, was used to calculate the internal consistency of residualized difference scores and determine how many trials are required to reach three thresholds of internal consistency (i.e., ≥ .7, .8, .9). The average number of correct trials from each task was used for the correct-trial count and, like the internal consistency of subtraction-based difference scores, the focus was on examining the impact of increasing the number of error trials on the internal consistency of the residualized scores.</p><p>Eq. ( <ref type="formula">3</ref>)</p><p>The estimation of the internal consistency of residualized scores used internal consistencies of X ( 𝑋𝑋 ) and Y ( 𝑌𝑌 ) and their squared correlation (2 2 𝑋𝑌 ) <ref type="bibr">(Clayson, Baldwin, &amp; Larson, 2021)</ref>.</p><p>Aim 3. To examine task differences in internal consistency (i.e., dependability, ICC) of each ERP, post-estimation contrasts from the Bayesian location-scale multilevel models were used to estimate variance components. Eq. ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>) and (2) were used to calculate dependability estimates using 20 error trials and the average number of correct trials. Eq. ( <ref type="formula">4</ref>), shown below, was used to calculate intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) for each ERP from each task, which can be interpreted as the proportion between-person variance to total variance. Eq. ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>),</p><p>shown below, was used to calculate ICCs for subtraction-based difference scores <ref type="bibr">(Clayson, Baldwin, &amp; Larson, 2021)</ref>.</p><p>Eq. ( <ref type="formula">4</ref>)</p><p>Eq. ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>)</p><p>Task differences in dependability and ICCs were supported when the 95% credible interval of the post-estimation contrasts included zero. Eq (5) includes the covariance between residuals for sake of completeness, but error covariances were set to zero <ref type="bibr">(Clayson, Baldwin, &amp; Larson, 2021)</ref>.</p></div>
