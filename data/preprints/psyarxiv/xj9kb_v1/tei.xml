<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Executive functions (EFs) are a set of cognitive abilities associated with many social and clinical outcomes which are believed to be sensitive to culture, age and educational attainment. Yet, theoretical models of EF and tasks used to measure them were developed mainly for highly educated young adults from developed countries. Here we assessed EFs in a diverse cohort from a rural town in Brazil (Baependi Heart Study: N=1253; 753 females), in which age (18-88 year) and schooling (0-23 years) varied widely. Based on a popular theoretical model of EF (the unity diversity EF framework), which describes the pattern of inter-associations of three specific types of EFs (inhibitions, shifting and updating), we developed a short, nonautomated, open-access EF test battery adapted for use in samples with varying schooling and age that included EF indicators obtained from three tasks (Plus-Minus, Trail Making and Random Number Generation tasks). Using Confirmatory Factor Analyses we found a good fitting three-correlated factor solution confirming the fractionation and inter-association of the three EF domains that was invariant (except for one of eight indicators) to age, schooling and sex. More years of schooling was related to higher latent traits in all domains, older age to worse shifting and women scored lower in latent shifting and inhibition. We conclude that the unity-diversity EF framework can be determined across adulthood in diverse samples with tasks adapted for these populations, allowing the theory-oriented investigation of sociocultural and demographic factors that influence EFs.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>Executive functions (EFs) are a set of cognitive capacities responsible for forming, planning, maintaining and implementing goals which are temporarily held in working memory <ref type="bibr">(Friedman &amp; Miyake,2017)</ref>. Because these capacities underly essential human abilities such as abstraction, reasoning, making decisions, controlling thought and action <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Friedman &amp; Miyake, 2017)</ref>, it stands to reason that there should be aspects of executive functioning that are universal to humankind and that are similarly altered as people grow older, irrespective of their backgrounds <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Barrett, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Liebal &amp; Haun, 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Another important aspect regarding EFs' central role in behavior is that they are associated with many outcomes such as academic and professional success, interpersonal and social interactions and physical and mental health (see <ref type="bibr">Baggeta &amp; Alexander, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Dias et al., 2024)</ref>. However, this was determined mainly in samples from high income countries. This is a limitation of the literature because, across development, many aspects of behavior are influenced by sociocultural factors which involve different languages, types of mental demands undertaken in people's daily lives, their social values and norms (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Barrett, 2020)</ref>. This also applies to EFs <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Schirmbeck et al., 2020)</ref>. It is therefore paramount to determine whether EF performance is similar in diverse samples so that a more inclusive and comprehensive portrait of human EF abilities can be established. Although most of the literature recognizes that EFs are multidimensional (i.e. include many different abilities), determining common aspects of EF across cultures has been hampered not only by a lack of diversity in the samples used in EF studies, but also by the differences in theoretical perspectives that were adopted across publications and the ambivalence in how the tested EF measures map onto specific EF constructs <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Dias et al., 2024)</ref>. Hence, for a better understanding of EFs it is necessary that studies be based on sound theoretical models and be assessed in different populations. This requires the adaption of tasks to ensure that the population under study can successfully understand and carry them out, which are dependant on their native language and culture and the extent to which test-takers were cognitive stimulated throughout life.</p><p>There are many theoretical models of EF that are based on abilities that do not relate to emotional and/or social stimuli (termed cool executive functions). Probably the most influential one <ref type="bibr">(Baggeta &amp; Alexander, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Dias et al., 2024)</ref> is the unity and diversity framework of EFs <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Friedman &amp; Miyake, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Miyake et al., 2000)</ref>, which we based the present study on. This framework proposes that EF abilities are correlated (unity of EF), yet separable (diversity or fractionation) at the level of latent variables, that is, variables that represent the shared variance in scores (indicators) of more than one task that measures similar executive processes. The unity and separability of EF was initially explored considering three (among the many types) of existing executive abilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Miyake et al., 2000)</ref>: a) inhibition of automatic or prepotent responses (henceforth called inhibition), that is, the ability to suppress habitual behavior; b) switching or shifting, the ability to alternate between two or more goals; and c) updating, the capacity to update the contents held in working memory in order to temporarily maintain only information that is relevant to reach a given goal. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Miyake et al. (2000)</ref> found these three latent EF domains to be separable but interrelated in a threecorrelated latent factor configuration/solution.</p><p>Since this initial proposal, the unity and fractionation of executive domains into three-correlated factors was replicated in samples with different demographic characteristics, but many studies also found alternative model configurations, such as only two-factors, in which two of the three domains were merged <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Karr et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>The most common selected configural solution in adults takes in a bifactor configuration (also called "nested"), in which the variance of the latent variable obtained from performance in the inhibition tasks is completely explained by a factor that represented the common variance in scores obtained from all tasks that measured inhibition, shifting and updating <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Friedman et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Friedman &amp; Miyake, 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Both the three-correlated and bifactor models have also been found to have distinguishable physiological underpinnings <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Feng et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Friedman &amp; Miyake, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Friedman &amp; Robbins, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Ma et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Rodríguez-Nieto et al., 2022)</ref>, that is, all EF domains involve similar processes (unity) although each one shows specific effects as well (diversity).</p><p>The abovementioned studies on the EF unity and diversity framework in adulthood involved mostly samples from high income countries that either included only young individuals or older ones but with restricted age ranges (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Karr et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Wray et al., 2020)</ref> and used tasks that were developed for these populations (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Dias et al., 2024)</ref>. This limits the generalization of this framework to more diverse samples from low-and middle-income countries, where living standards and life opportunities tend to be much less homogenous. This is a considerable hindrance when studying EFs because there is a strong body of evidence that low socioeconomic status affects cognitive development (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Amin et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Ardila et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Franzen et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Lavrencic et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Lawson et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Wray et al., 2020)</ref> since before birth, persist at later ages and is intertwined with low cognitive stimulation (often indexed by limited educational attainment) in predicting outcomes such as physical and mental health <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Hackman et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Farah, 2017)</ref>. Furthermore, even in developed nations in which there are small disparities among people in terms of years of education, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Amin et al. (2022)</ref> found improvement on cognitive abilities caused by increasing schooling from secondary to tertiary levels.</p><p>EFs also change with age over adulthood. A meta-analysis showed that compared to 18-35-year-olds, people over the age of 65 years have worse performance in all three EF domains, although results were not uniform in terms of variability across tasks and domains, updating have been the least affected. Moreover, some studies propose that, in later adulthood, there is a tendency of de-differentiation among EFs domains, that is, they tend to become less separable as people age, although the exact time of life when this occurs is still unknown (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Glisky et al., 2021)</ref>. Sex effects on EFs are much less clear and no consistent pattern has been found <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Gaillard et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Grissom &amp; Reyes, 2019)</ref>.</p><p>This overview of the literature shows that data is still lacking to confirm the applicability of the EF unity diversity framework in adults from low-or middle-income countries who have different academic opportunities and to establish to what extent schooling, age and sex influence the pattern of inter-associations among inhibition, shifting and updating. It is therefore timely to investigate this theoretical framework in diverse samples spanning all of adulthood. To this end we assessed EFs of an adult cohort from a small rural town in Brazil including individuals of varying age and educational attainment (from illiterate to post-graduate degrees).</p><p>To reach our objective, the first step was to select EF tasks that are representative of the three EF domains proposed by the proponents of the framework mentioned above <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Friedman &amp; Miyake, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Miyake et al., 2000)</ref> and that could be carried out by people of vastly different levels of schooling and ages. This was a challenging endeavor as there are very few cognitive tasks that are adequate for loweducated populations from different cultural settings <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Ardila et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Dias et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Franzen et al., 2020)</ref>. The usual tasks employed in this literature mostly involve complex instructions and words or similar verbal stimuli, which are not always adequate for people who speak languages other than English and that also put those with lower schooling at a disadvantage seeing that their vocabulary is more restricted (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Ardila et al., 2010)</ref>. Additionally, most studies use computerized tasks that involve key presses to make responses, so performance of test takers who are unfamiliar with computers can be negatively affected. For a comprehensive description of these issues when testing EF in diverse populations, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Zanini et al. (2021)</ref>.</p><p>To select EF measures we thus prioritized tasks that have numbers as stimuli, which are recalled and manipulated more easily than other types of verbal stimuli by illiterate/barely literate populations <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Ardila et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Deloche et al., 1999)</ref>. We also sought to use tasks that could be completed quickly to avoid fatigue (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Balconi et al., 2023)</ref>, which could more heavily tax individuals with lower education, with the proviso that the battery had to yield at least two measures (indicators) of each EF domain so that we could calculate a latent factor for each one of them. To avoid differential familiarity with computers among participants, we used non-automatized tasks, which are not necessarily less valid for cognitive assessment than computerized ones <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Kessels, 2019)</ref>.</p><p>Additionally, to facilitates replications in other diverse samples, the selected tasks can be administered by non-specialists with only a little training and are in the public domain, making them more affordable to researchers worldwide who do not have access to specialists in neuropsychology, nor funds to pay for tests, hardware and proprietary software.</p><p>Our EF task battery was comprised of three tasks that can be completed in around 10 minutes. The Random Number Generation task (RNG; <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Towse &amp; Neil, 1998)</ref> was used to assess updating and inhibition. This task consists of naming digits 1 to 9 in a random order for a couple of minutes at a fixed pace. This can only be successful if test takers manage to keep in mind the prior numbers that were generated (continuously update the content in working memory), which is necessary to avoid (inhibit) habitual, stereotyped, non-random patterns (e.g. sequentially naming digits of increasing or decreasing magnitude, producing sequences of even or odd numbers and such like; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Oomens et al., 2015)</ref>. Indeed, specific randomization indexes obtained from RNG task responses (for detail, see Methods) were found to load mainly on two of the three EF domains of interest, updating and inhibition, in the studies by <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Miyake et al. (2000)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Friedman and Miyake (2004)</ref>. Some of the same RNG indexes also loaded on separate principal component factors in <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Towse and</ref><ref type="bibr">Neil's (1998), Oomens et al.'s (2015)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Chatzopoulos et al.'s (2021)</ref> studies (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Audiffren, 2009)</ref>, indicating that they measured different cognitive abilities.</p><p>To assess EF switching, we used the Plus-Minus task <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Miyake et al., 2000)</ref>, which involves sequentially switching between adding and subtracting three from a list of two-digit numbers, as well as the Trail Making Task part B <ref type="bibr">(Buck, 2013)</ref>, which requires switching between connecting letters in alphabetical order and numbers of increasing size which are displayed on a sheet of paper, a common measure of this EF domain (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Maldonado et al., 2020)</ref>. With these three tasks, which yield two or more indicators for each of the three EF domains under study, it would thus be possible to obtain latent factors to determine the unity and diversity of EF. To test the effects of age, schooling and sex on the executive domains it was necessary to first ensure that these EF indicators measured the same constructs across these demographic variables (invariance testing: see <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Chen, 2008)</ref>.</p><p>The specific aims of the present study were therefore: 1) to investigate whether performance metrics of inhibition and updating, obtained from the RNG task, and of shifting, obtained from the Plus-Minus and Trail Making B tasks, allowed the replication of a good fitting confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) model that differentiated latent inhibitions, shifting and updating or combinations of these factors in our sample across adulthood (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Karr et al., 2018)</ref>; and 2) to test indicators for invariance to schooling, age and sex in the best fitting model configuration that was obtained and, if this was found, to describe schooling, age and sex effects on EF latent factors. We hypothesized that either the trifactor or bifactor <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Friedman &amp; Miyake, 2017)</ref> model, which tend to be the most replicated ones in adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Karr et al., 2018)</ref>, would be found to have adequate fit due to the: 1) care taken in selecting adequate indicators of the three EF domains of the unity diversity framework, the most seminal EF theoretical model to date <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Baggetta &amp; Alexander, 2016)</ref>; and 2) fact that EFs are essential human abilities so similar patterns of inter-relations among domains should be present irrespective of people's sociocultural background <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Barrett, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Liebal &amp; Haun, 2018)</ref>.</p><p>We predicted that EF latent performance in most of the tested domains would be lower in older <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Maldonado et al., 2020)</ref> and less schooled individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Lavrencic et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Wray et al., 2020)</ref>, but expected no EF sex differences, which have not been consistently found (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Gaillard et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Grissom &amp; Reyes, 2019)</ref>. Heart Study cohort (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Egan et al., 2016)</ref>, who were aged 18 to 88 years, with educational attainment ranging from zero to 23 years of schooling and who underwent the EF test battery described below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>METHODS</head><p>Procedure: this cross-sectional study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Faculdade de Medicina of the Universidade de São Paulo, Brazil (#245-15) and all participants provided written informed consent. Sampling and other information on the tested population can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Egan et al. (2016)</ref>. We undertook extensive piloting before establishing the parameters of the EF tasks/measures which will be detailed only regarding some specific aspects. Participants were assessed once (see test battery below) in a quiet environment at their own homes at the time of day that was to their convenience.</p><p>They also provided information on years of schooling, age and sex. Other data were also obtained from participants and results have been reported elsewhere.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Executive functions test battery</head><p>-Random Number Generation (RNG; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Towse &amp; Neil, 1998)</ref>: this task was used to assess the executive domains of inhibition and updating. The volunteers were instructed to generate 110 digits in a random sequence containing numbers (from 1 to 9) following a tone presented at a rate of one digit every 1.5 s (rate determined in pilot studies) produced by a metronomer. The answers were vocal and taken down by the experimenter.</p><p>To illustrate the concept of randomness the instructions used the analogy of picking numbers from a hat and then replacing the numbers in the hat before the next draw.</p><p>Indices of randomness were calculated using the free software RGCalc (<ref type="url" target="http://www.lancs.ac.uk/staff/towse/rgcpage.html">http://www.lancs.ac.uk/staff/towse/rgcpage.html</ref>). The first 10 responses were treated as practice trials and were not scored. Scores were RNG indices obtained from the remaining generated digits which were found to be related to inhibition and updating <ref type="bibr">(Friedman &amp; Miyake, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Miyake et al., 2000)</ref>.</p><p>The inhibition indexes were: 1) the Turning Point Index (TPI) measures the regularity of the sequence of generated numbers taking into account ascending and descending series. For example, in the sequence "1, 5, 7, 4, 2" the digit "7" represents a TPI, since from there the sequence starts to decrease; 2) the Runs index, which is very similar to the TPI and indicates the variability between the size of ascending and descending sequences; and 3) Adjacency, which corresponds to the percentage of occurrence of obvious pairs in the sequence (for example 1 followed by 2, 5 followed by 6, etc.).</p><p>The updating indexes were: 1) Redundancy, which reflects the frequency (in %) of use of each digit throughout the test (values close to zero indicate lower redundancy);</p><p>2) the Coupon indexes, which measures the number of digits generated before all possibilities (1 to 9) are used (a score of 9 would indicate that all numbers were mentioned for every 9 digits generated); and 3) the Mean Repetition Gap, which reflects the average number of digits generated until a given digit is repeated.</p><p>For Redundancy, Coupon, Adjacency and Runs indexes, the lower the score, the better the performance; for Mean Repetition Gap, the higher the score, the better the performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Audiffren, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Maes et al., 2011)</ref>, while TPI scores are better when near 100 <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Towse &amp; Neil, 1998)</ref>. Errors, such as saying 10 or zero, and failures to generate numbers at every tone were ignored in the sequences.</p><p>-Plus-Minus shifting task (modified from <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Miyake et al., 2000)</ref>: this is a paper-and-pencil measure of executive shifting. Participants were asked to alternate between adding and subtracting three to a list of two-digit number and writing down the answers while keeping in mind what was the last operation to be carried out (there were no cues regarding this). This was done on an answer sheet presenting 30 two-digit numbers that were randomly picked from 10-99, except that we excluded numbers which ended in 8 and 9 when three was to be added (e.g. 19+3=21), and numbers ending in one and two when three was to be subtracted (e.g. 32-3=29), which were found to be more difficult for little schooled individuals in pilot studies. They were asked to begin by adding three to the first two-digit number and work on the task as quickly as possible, avoiding mistakes. We assessed the time to complete the task, errors in the mathematical operations and shifting errors (the number of times two sequential calculations were additions or subtractions). As very few calculation errors were made, the score was a rate correct score (which corrects for speed-accuracy tradeoffs: Vandierendonck, 2017): number of correct shifts, from a possible maximum of 30, divided by the time taken to complete the task.</p><p>-Trail Making Test (TMT), part B (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Bucks, 2013)</ref>: this paper-and-pencil test involves a sheet of paper on which 25 scattered circles in which a single digits (from 1 to 12) or consecutive letter (from A to M) is printed. The task consists of using a pen to connect the circles, beginning with the first number, shifting to the first letter, then shifting back to the second number, and so forth (i.e. 1-A, 2-B, 3-C, etc.), as quickly as possible, avoiding mistakes and not lifting the pen. So that scores were comparable to those used in the Plus-Minus task, the Trail Making rate correct scores were also used: the number of circles connected in the right order divided by the total time taken to complete the task except that, following the standard administration procedure, participants were excluded if they took more than 300 s to complete the task.</p></div>

There were many patterns of missing data which were dealt with by MLR estimator.

The final model (Table <ref type="table">2</ref>; Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">1</ref>) including this correlation showed a good fit for all indices except for the chi-square, which is not a limitation because it is sensitive to sample size.

Hence, this model presented partial invariance regarding only one of the eight used indicators. Note that at each of these steps the Plus-Minus task indicator also showed the same MI values as that of the Trail Making task. The reason we chose to free the paths of the latter was that inspection of the standardized expected parameter change index (StdYX E.P.C.), which reflects the expected parameter value in the absence of the equality constraint, revealed it to be lower for the Plus-Minus task for all three covariates.-&lt;Figure 2 near here&gt; As to population heterogeneity (Figure <ref type="figure">2B</ref>), a higher number of years of schooling was positively and significantly associated with scores of all the three latent factors: shifting (β=0.48, p&lt;0.001), inhibition (β=0.17, p&lt;0.001) and updating (β=-0.08, p=0.044). Linear age effects were only found for the shifting latent factor (decreased with age: β=-0.18, p&lt;0.001) and women had lower scores in the inhibition (β=-0.30, p&lt;0.001) and shifting (β=-0.61, p&lt;0.001) latent factors than men. This occurred despite women being slightly more educated [women = 9.53±4.37 years of schooling; men (mean±SD)= 8.61± 4.13 years of schooling; Cohen d=0.22) and less than a year younger (women: 41.79±14.26 years; men: 42.59±14.99 years; Cohen d=0.05), on average, but these differences were of very small effect sizes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p>In this study, which involved a diverse Brazilian sample spanning all of adulthood that varied widely in terms of educational attainment, we obtained a good fitting three-factor model, successfully replicating one of the most common configural solutions of the EF unity and diversity framework in adults (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Karr et al., 2018)</ref>. The fact that this was found before mostly in samples from higher income nations suggests commonalities in the pattern of fractionation and inter-associations of EF domains across countries in adulthood <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Barrett, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Liebal &amp; Haun, 2018)</ref>, despite the influence of sociocultural and other environmental factors in the development of these cognitive abilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Gustavson et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Schirmbeck et al., 2020)</ref>. Furthermore, as predicted, schooling was positively associated with all three tested EF latent domains, confirming the well-known negative impact of low education (and/or adverse socioeconomic environments) on EF in adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Lavrencic et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Roldán-Tapia et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Wray et al., 2020)</ref>. We also found negative age effects, but only for shifting, and an unexpected sex effect on shifting and inhibition favoring men. Next, we detail our results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Latent EF factor model configuration</head><p>We tested many EF latent factor model configurations which have been reported in the literature, only some of which usually converge and present adequate fit to the data in each publication <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Karr et al., 2018)</ref>. Differences among studies in this respect can be explained by many features that influence CFA results which are: 1) analytic in nature (e.g. choice of model parameters/identification, the number of factors/subfactors to be confirmed, cutoff values of fit indices <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Karr et al., 2018)</ref>; 2) related to the particular set of EF indicators that are used (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Glisky et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Karr et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Yangüez et al., 2023)</ref>; and 3) associated with sample characteristics <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Karr et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>We will address each of these features in turn to discuss our results.</p><p>First, rates of acceptance (convergence and adequate fit) of different types of model configurations in the EF unity-diversity literature are overall quite low <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Karr et al., 2018)</ref>, particularly convergence of bifactor models which, when they do converge, tend to have an overfitting tendency <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Yangüez et al., 2023)</ref>. Low convergence of this configuration explains why our bifactor was non-convergent, even when we added correlations between the shifting and updating factors in the bifactor-(S-1) model, which is today deemed to be psychometrically necessary <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Eid et al., 2017)</ref>. The latter model, to our knowledge, was only tested before in typically developing adolescents and also failed to converge (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Segura et al., 2023)</ref>. On the other hand, the fact that converging models overfit to data can account for why EF bifactor models are often selected as the best fitting ones in many papers that tested adult samples (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Karr et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Regarding EF indicators, many publications in this field investigate EF domains that do not map onto the ones proposed by the proponents of the theoretical framework under study <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Miyake et al., 2000)</ref>. Examples are testing distinct types of inhibition, working memory capacity instead of updating, and/or including extra domains such as access to long term memory (for a discussion on this issue, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Zanini et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>Hence, the fact that studies differ in terms of model configurations should not come as a surprise because they may have tested different abilities that inter-associate in different ways. Nonetheless, it is notable that in our diverse sample the good fitting threecorrelated factor solution corroborated the interrelation and separability of inhibition, shifting and updating that was proposed in the initial version of the unity-diversity framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Miyake et al., 2000)</ref> and that was also found in many other studies that considered the same EF constructs as we did, yet were obtained in widely different adult populations that varied in terms of sample size, sociocultural aspects and age (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Feng et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Fisk &amp; Sharp, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Friedman et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Glisky et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Ma et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Miyake et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Vaughan &amp; Giovanello, 2010)</ref>. This is even more noteworthy considering another issue that influences model configurations and can contribute to variability in latent models among studies (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Glisky et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Karr et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Yangüez et al., 2023)</ref>: despite the similarity in EF constructs tested across these studies and their use of similar sets of EF tests (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Ma et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Maldonado et al., 2020)</ref>, which were not the same as ours, these publications often varied in terms of EF indicators obtained from the tasks (e.g. reaction time, accuracy, trial-by-trial variability, or other metrics).</p><p>However, the correlations among the three factors in our study were much lower than those reported in many previous publications in young (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Friedman et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Friedman &amp; Miyake, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Miyake et al., 2000)</ref> and older adults (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Ma et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Vaughan &amp; Giovanello, 2010</ref>) that explored the same types of EF domains as we did.</p><p>This was by no means exclusive to the present study, nor to specific ages in adulthood.</p><p>For example, lower correlations were also found by <ref type="bibr">Glisky et al. (2020)</ref> in 18-32-yearolds from the United States, and by <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Fisk and Sharp (2004)</ref>, whose sample was from the United Kingdom and ranged in age from 20 to 81 years [although they used a different psychometric approach (principal component analysis) and included one more EF domain (access to long-term memory)]. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Feng et al. (2022)</ref> had a mixed pattern of results in young, highly educated Han Chinese: a high correlation between inhibition and updating but low ones between the other combinations of latent factors.</p><p>Although the trifactor model had the best fit, we also obtained a good fitting two-factor configuration (with inhibition and shifting merged), equivalent to the model reported by <ref type="bibr">Glisky et al. (2020)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Vaughan and Giovanello (2010)</ref> in elderly from the United States of America, although merging inhibition and updating provided a similar <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Vaughan &amp; Giovanello, 2010)</ref> or better fit to the data in young <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Feng et al., 2022)</ref> and older adult <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Ma et al., 2023)</ref> Chinese. As we found both these configurations, which mapped onto those of other studies that used different EF measures of the same domains, point to de adequacy of our choice of tasks/indicators to test the theoretical framework of <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Miyake et al. (2000)</ref> for our sample. This was reinforced by the finding of invariance to demographic variables at the task level (except for one of eight indicators), signaling that the same EF constructs <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Chen, 2008)</ref> were measured irrespective of participants' schooling, age and sex, which is seldom tested for in this particular literature. Previous attempts to propose EF test batteries based on the same theoretical framework for samples from low-and/or middle-income countries did not include enough measures to compute latent variables for the three EF domains and involved paying for access to tasks (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Wray et al., 2020)</ref>, or were openly available, but very time consuming (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Zanini et al., 2021)</ref>, unlike our 10 minute-long, non-automated and free access battery.</p><p>The third aspect that influences CFA model configurations (i.e. demographic differences among samples) must also be considered in explaining our results, particularly regarding age. Some studies suggest that the tested latent factors may operate more independently in young versus older adults, with a de-differentiation of these abilities as people grow older, possibly because they develop different strategies to optimize performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Glisky et al., 2021)</ref>. Although we tested 18-88-year-olds, unlike other samples which varied much less in age ranges, we did not test different model configurations for different age groups. The reason was that this would have depended on establishing arbitrary age cutoffs (which differ from study to study, likely introducing bias in age effects) and because this would not have allowed us to determine demographic effects for the whole sample, which are described in the next section. Notwithstanding, the separability of the three domains was observed considering our whole sample, similarly to reports in other studies on older adults, which also found similarly-fitting two-model configurations with different combinations of latent EF domains (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Ma et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Vaughan &amp; Giovanello, 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Therefore, the hypothesis of age-related de-differentiation is in need of further support, as claimed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Karr et al. (2018)</ref>.</p><p>Hence, our finding of a trifactor model in a diverse sample in terms of age and schooling speaks to the usefulness of the unity-diversity framework across adulthood applied to a broader set of samples, at least when it comes to considering the specific EF domains following the theoretical perspective of <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Miyake et al. (2000)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Demographic effects</head><p>The fact that we found invariance to demographic effects at the EF indicator level provided evidence that the same theoretical constructs were assessed across participants of different ages, who had different educational attainment and were of either sex, conferring a good foundation for testing the influences of these demographic effects on EFs at the latent trait level.</p><p>In spite of the wide age difference among participants, only shifting was linearly negatively related to age, so we did not find the age-related decline in all EFs domains reported in a meta-analyses of age effects on EFs <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Maldonado et al., 2020)</ref>. This metaanalysis, however, contrasted performance of young (18-35-year-olds) versus that of older individuals (&gt;60 years) separated into groups based on arbitrary age cutoffs (as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Glisky et al., 2021)</ref> and considered EF scores across studies without taking their interassociations and invariance testing into consideration, differently from our approach.</p><p>Our lack of effects regarding updating concurred, nonetheless, with the fact that this domain seems to be the least affected by age <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Maldonado et al., 2020)</ref>. As to inhibition, our results are more in line with the idea that performance in this domain may not be linearly impaired as people age, as observed in a study published after the abovementioned meta-analyses. <ref type="bibr">Verissimo et al. (2021)</ref>, who used a large sample of 58-98-year-old Taiwanese, found that performance that indexes efficiency in inhibitory control (using the classic Flanker task) actually improved from the age of 58 to mid/late 70s, after which it declined <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Veríssimo et al., 2021)</ref>. Because a considerable portion of our sample was younger than 58 years-old, it is possible that this non-linear effect in older individuals was not picked up in our linear analysis.</p><p>Concerning schooling, we found that higher education was related to significantly better latent shifting, inhibition and updating traits, corroborating the positive link between cognitive stimulation/socioeconomic factors and EF performance in adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Fisk &amp; Sharp, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr">Lavrencic et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Wray et al., 2020)</ref>, which is also described for other ages and/or cognitive abilities in samples from different nations <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Amin et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Ardila et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Farah, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Franzen et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Hackman et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Lawson et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Segura et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Schirmbeck et al., 2020)</ref>. Because EFs are related to many outcomes in life and susceptible to enhancement following many types of manipulations, researchers have proposed that educational initiatives and/or interventions that stimulate EFs may help improve health <ref type="bibr">(Baggeta &amp; Alexander, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Dias et al., 2024)</ref> and break the intergenerational reproduction of poverty and deprivation <ref type="bibr">(de Neubourg et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Regarding sex differences, we found that women had worse shifting and inhibition latent scores compared to men, which were unexpected effects considering that literature reviews point to no consistent sex/gender effects on EFs <ref type="bibr">(Gaillard et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Grissom &amp; Reyes, 2019)</ref>; when sex differences are observed, they are usually secondary to differential sex-related cognitive strategies and/or spatial abilities that are not executive in nature, despite being recruited to perform many types of EF tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Grissom &amp; Reyes, 2019)</ref> that are quite different from those used here. Our sex effects can therefore be better accounted for by an important issue that is overlooked in studies from high income countries, namely occupational sex-related discrimination or segregation favoring men, which is rife in Brazil <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(King, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr">Tonet Maciel, 2021)</ref>, and could be more pronounced in rural areas <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(King, 2009)</ref>, such as in Baependi where the participants of this study reside. Although these sex/gender occupational differences cannot usually be explained by differences in human capital <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(King, 2009)</ref>, this type of segregation means that women often take on less cognitive demanding jobs, especially those who have lower schooling. As the shifting Trail Making and Plus-Minus metrics and the inhibition indexes of the RNG task depend on numeracy and literacy (sequencing numbers and letters, mental calculations and knowledge of ways in which numbers can be organized), we tentatively suggest that a portion of the tested women could have been more cognitive overloaded while doing these tasks, resulting in poorer scores. This is a form of lower cognitive reserve, which is found to affect cognitive performance across adulthood <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Roldán-Tapia et al., 2012)</ref>. Educational and age differences were probably not to blame for these sex-effects because the model controlled for these variables, their covariance was not significant and, on average, men and women had similar years of schooling and age. In contrast, participants of both sexes did not differ in the ability to keep the last generated numbers in mind, indexed by the updating indicators from the RNG task <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Towse &amp; Neil, 1998)</ref>, a domain that was nonetheless sensitive to schooling, as mentioned above.</p><p>Overall, we found that the three tested EF domains were not equally sensitive to the tested demographic effects, shifting having been the most affected one by education, age and sex. We suggest some possible reasons for this. The first is that there seems to be something particular about shifting, as discussed at length by <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Karr et al. (2018)</ref>. For instance, the gradual differentiation of EFs (from a single general domain in early life to three domains in early adulthood) shows shifting to emerge first as a specific factor around the passage from childhood to adolescence <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Karr et al., 2018)</ref>. A study in elderly participants also found that, among the three EF domains, only shifting had genetic markers linked to dopamine D2 receptor genes <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Ma et al., 2023)</ref>. Because changes in this receptor occur as people become older <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Ma et al., 2023)</ref>, this may make shifting more prone to pick up age effect, as we observed. Additionally, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Feng et al. (2022)</ref> found other genetic markers for inhibition, updating and for a general EF factor that were not present for shifting, which is further evidence that the EF domains tested here have different biological underpinnings <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Friedman &amp; Miyake, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Friedman &amp; Robbins, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Rodríguez-Nieto et al., 2022)</ref>.</p><p>Another non-exclusive explanation for the higher sensitivity of shifting to demographic variables has to do with processing speed, which is related to but does not account for the totality of EF performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Glisky et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Maldonado et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Wray et al., 2020)</ref>. The reason is that the tasks used to assess this domain (Plus-Minus and Trail Making task), unlike the RNG task, were self-paced, meaning that participants could take as long as they needed to respond to each stimulus. A possible consequence of this is that performance may have been more varied among participants, allowing the shifting latent factor to better capture impairment in older individuals, partly due to agerelated slowing of processing speed <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Glisky et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Maldonado et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Roldán-Tapia et al., 2012)</ref>. Whether speed effects could explain part of the negative effects of education on shifting is less clear because no consistent speed effect has been found for individuals of different schooling levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[Staff et al. (2016)</ref> found positive associations but <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Lavrencic et al. (2018)</ref> did not (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Veríssimo et al., 2021)</ref>]. Speed is also unlikely to explain why women scored lower in inhibition because they had similar updating abilities to men, assessed with indicators obtained from the same non-self-paced RNG task. Furthermore, there is no general male advantage in processing speed across the lifespan <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Camarata &amp; Woodcock, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Nooyens et al., 2022)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General results, limitations and future perspectives</head><p>In sum, we found that a short, nonautomated, copyright-free test battery that can be administered by researchers with little training fit the theoretical and psychometric requirements to test the unity and diversity of inhibition, shifting and updating in a sample from a developing country across adulthood and that varied in educational attainment. This battery may also prove to be adaptable for other populations that are seldom represented in EF studies, allowing: 1) cross-cultural studies which can inform on the role of cultural and sociodemographic factors on EFs in a theory-oriented manner <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Dias et al., 2024)</ref> and; 2) studies that aim to develop appropriate socio-culturally sensitive interventions to diminish the effects of impaired EFs on various types of outcomes (see <ref type="bibr">Baggeta &amp; Alexander, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Dias et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr">de Neubourg et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>As to limitations of this study, although our shifting indicators were obtained from commonly used tasks (Trail Making and Plus-Minus), a novelty that requires replication was our use of inhibition and updating indicators derived from a single test (RNG task). We do not believe this constitutes a limitation because moderate factor loading of these indicators on their respective domains was found and these latent factors were only very weakly intercorrelated, indicating that they measured different cognitive abilities, as suggested by others <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Audiffren, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Chatzopoulos et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr">Friedman &amp; Miyake, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Miyake et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Oomens et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Towse &amp; Neil, 1998)</ref>. Our rate-correct <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Vandierendonck, 2017)</ref> shifting score indicators controlled for speed-accuracy trade-offs <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Yangüez et al., 2023)</ref>, so this was not a limitation of our study, but no such measure could be derived from the RNG task that was not self-paced.</p><p>Ideally, all indicators should have been similarly controlled for processing speed effects, which is a general limitation of the literature that tested the EF unity diversity framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Maldonado et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr">Schweizer et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Yangüez et al., 2023)</ref>. We also did not analyze different model configurations considering different patterns of missing data, nor treated the data for omission errors (see <ref type="bibr">Schweizer et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Towse &amp; Neil, 1998)</ref> because there is no consensual way to do so in the unity-diversity literature. Although schooling is regarded as a measure of cognitive reserve <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Lavrencic et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Staff et al., 2016)</ref>, other variables associated with this construct like occupation (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Roldán-Tapia et al., 2012)</ref> and engagement in leisure activities across life were not available for our sample and might have yielded additional explanations for our patterns of demographic effects. Our sample was also not screened for clinical conditions or cognitive impairment, which could have influenced EF performance, and was a family-based cohort, in which individuals were related to different extents. This was not controlled for either due to a lack of validated, widespread use of analytic confirmatory structural equation approached to deal with extended pedigree designs.</p><p>Finally, to improve upon our findings, some alterations to the test battery/indicators may increase reliability, especially for samples with low education.</p><p>First, only the Trail-Making task score was not invariant across age/schooling, which was not entirely surprising: different levels of familiarity with numbers and the alphabet across people with different educational attainment, which is lower in Brazil in older individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Kang et al., 2021)</ref>, influences performance differently when tasks involve these abilities (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Ardila et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Deloche et al., 1999)</ref>. Other Trail Making tasks that do not include letters are also available <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Kim et al., 2014)</ref> and may be an alternative. Non-paced number generation <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Oomens et al., 2015)</ref> can also substitute the self-paced version of the RNG administered here. Future studies should also strive to   solution with its fit indices. N.B.: circles represent latent factors, squares represent the indicators (raw scores) per executive domain. Curved, two-headed arrows linking latent factors indicate correlations, expressed as values on the arrows; values on the straight arrows pointed from the latent factors to the indicators are factor loadings and values on the right, next to the arrows pointing to each indicator are residuals. The curved, two-headed arrow linking residuals are a modification index (MI). Estimates are completely standardized. Nonsignificant values are represented in grey. EF indicators were: TPI=turning point index of the Random Number Generation task (RNG), Trails=rate correct score of the trail making test part B, Plus-Minus shifting=rate correct scores of shifting cost; repetition gap=mean repetition gap index of the RNG; the other indicators are indexes of the RNG.

The model freeing the estimation of this path showed acceptable fit but still showed DIF of the Trail Making on age. By freeing the direct path of Trail Making on age the model had good fit, but the Trail Making Task showed again DIF on schooling. The model including a path of the Trail Making Task indicator on schooling converged with a good fit (see Figure 2) and retrieved no more DIFs.
