<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Street harassment of women is a prevalent global problem with significant effects on the freedom and well-being of its victims. Change must come from the perpetrators and the cultures that enable this behaviour. However, little is known about attitudes and cognition contributing to tolerance of street harassment in societies. Independently, in two European cultures, we investigated the role of cognitive empathy (for victims of street harassment) and preference for social hierarchies (social dominance orientation, SDO) on tolerance of street harassment in heterosexual men. After being assessed for SDO and street harassment tolerance (i.e., belief in its acceptability in society), 136</p><p>Italian and 113 British heterosexual men viewed a video of a woman repeatedly subjected to street harassment. Afterwards, participants reported beliefs about emotions experienced by the woman and were again assessed for street harassment tolerance. The video had little impact on attitudes toward street harassment. However, results revealed that street harassment tolerance before and after the video was associated with both lower cognitive empathy and higher SDO. These effects replicated across two cultures. Together, these findings suggest two common possible attitudinal and cognitive targets for reducing street harassment tolerance and provide a springboard for further research in populations of other cultures, genders, and sexual orientations.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1.">Street harassment definition, prevalence, and consequences</head><p>Street harassment is a form of aggravation that involves verbal, non-verbal, or physical unwanted behaviour perpetrated by a stranger in public. While not the only form of harassment on the street (e.g., racist, homophobic, sexual, and other discriminatory behaviour within and between different groups), our focus is a common form perpetrated by heterosexual male strangers against females, consisting of uninvited expressed sexual appreciation or advances for which motivations and executions may differ from the other states and contexts <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Fileborn &amp; O'Neill, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Fischer &amp; Good, 1994)</ref>. Henceforth, when we use the term 'street harassment', we refer to this form.</p><p>Exposure to street harassment negatively impacts women's lives in several ways. It reduces victims' well-being through increased feelings of fear, anger, and violation <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bastomski &amp; Smith, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Betts et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Kearl, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Lenton et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Macmillan et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Nielsen, 2002)</ref>.</p><p>Victims will likely experience higher rates of depression, anxiety, inferior sleep <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Betts et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">DelGreco &amp; Christensen, 2020)</ref> and self-objectification <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Fairchild &amp; Rudman, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Fredrickson &amp; Roberts, 1997)</ref>. The consequent enhancement of fear of sexual violence causes women to unwillingly reduce their freedom of movement, change their behaviour, constantly assess safety, and avoid travelling alone <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bastomski &amp; Smith, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Hickman &amp; Muehlenhard, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Lenton et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Vera-Gray &amp; Kelly, 2020)</ref>. Street harassment also stokes social conflict. Women who experience or witness street harassment show higher levels of negative intergroup emotions and negative feelings toward men <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Chaudoir &amp; Quinn, 2010)</ref> while sharing a desire for justice against the harasser <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Fileborn &amp; Vera-Gray, 2017)</ref>.</p><p>The problem of street harassment is compounded by its frequency. Street harassment is a widespread vehicle of sexual harassment behaviour in our societies <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Macmillan et al., 2000)</ref>.</p><p>According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Gekoski et al. (2017)</ref>, incidents of harassment on public transport, for instance, are widespread. Prevalence rates across cultures varied from 15% in the U.K. to as high as 98% among women in Egypt. A recent international survey of over 15,500 women from 15 countries revealed that 80% had experienced street harassment at least once in their lives (International survey on sexual harassment in public spaces, 2021).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2.">Street Harassment literature and its limitations</head><p>Despite knowing more in recent years about the impact of street harassment on its victims, the factors contributing to harassment and its endorsement are still under-researched. This is a problem as the onus for social change rests on the shoulders of potential harassers and of the societies that tolerate this unwelcome behaviour. Perpetrators of street harassment usually go unidentified due to the brief nature of the encounters, being unknown to victims, and the lack of sanctions against them. This makes them not easily accessible to research; however, it is possible to study street harassment tolerance in societies (i.e., the degree of belief that street harassment is acceptable behaviour). Indirectly, this can be informative about the likelihood of harassment. Men who are more tolerant of street harassment and have peers who share that view are more likely to engage in harassing behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Darnell &amp; Cook, 2009)</ref>. Attitudes toward rape, sexual harassment, and street harassment tend to predict engagement in these behaviours <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(DelGreco et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Lanier, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Reilly et al., 1992)</ref>. More directly, by understanding the attitudes toward street harassment in societies, we can contextualise policy and sanction developments that increase social pressure to reduce street harassment and promote allyship for victims <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Fingerhut, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Goodman &amp; Moradi, 2008)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3.">Cognitive Empathy, Social Dominance Orientation, and differences between populations</head><p>Few studies have identified social predictors of street harassment and its tolerance <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Mumford et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Zietz &amp; Das, 2018)</ref>. Even fewer studies have researched cognitive and attitudinal predictors of that tolerance. On one hand, power over others seems to play a multifaceted role. <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Wesselmann and Kelly (2010)</ref> found that college men in the USA are motivated toward cat-calling by misogynistic attitudes and the ability to have power over women. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">DelGreco et al. (2021)</ref> correspondingly found that men who feel less empowered were also likelier to engage in street harassment -motivated to generate control over the victim's response (however, the response was desired to be positive, not one of distress). In qualitative work, <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Zietz and Das (2018)</ref> found that young men sampled in India capitalise on their powerful positions -perceiving street harassment through a self-serving lens of entitlement and misogyny that blames victims for the harassment. Support of social inequalities and the seeking of power within them is captured by the concept of social dominance orientation (SDO) <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Pratto, 1994)</ref>. Individuals with a high SDO may be more motivated to obtain or maintain power by embarrassing and objectifying others to assert, redress or maintain their status <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Berdahl, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Halper &amp; Rios, 2019)</ref> or hold expectations that the victim would welcome sexual attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Kunstman &amp; Maner, 2011)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Pryor (1994)</ref> found that men who reported themselves as more likely to engage in sexual harassment rate highly in authoritarianism, a trait associated with SDO. However, SDO has not yet been directly linked to street harassment tolerance. Therefore, the first aim of this research is to explore whether SDO is positively associated with street harassment tolerance.</p><p>On the other hand, there may be links to one's empathy for victims. A study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Darnell and Cook (2009)</ref> explored the influence of a documentary about women's experiences of street harassment on men's distress and sympathy for a victim of street harassment. While the intervention had little effect on attitudes, it revealed an association between hostility towards women and lower empathy for street harassment victims. Empathy involves the tendency to understand and share the feelings of others. It has been conceptualised as comprising cognitive (understanding the thoughts and emotions of others) and affective (sharing the emotions of others) aspects <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Blake &amp; Gannon, 2008</ref>). Empathy's cognitive component is our focus here. A meta-analysis by <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Jolliffe and Farrington (2004)</ref> noted a correlation between criminal offending and a lack of cognitive empathy. Correspondingly, aggressive behaviours, as street harassment arguably is, also tend to be associated with lower cognitive empathy levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Miller &amp; Eisenberg, 1988)</ref>. As an intervention, increasing empathy can reduce the acceptance of myths that serve to justify the harassment of women <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Diehl et al., 2014)</ref>. The experience of street harassment for women is overwhelmingly negative. This suggests that beliefs in a more negative victim experience demonstrate higher cognitive empathy <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(DelGreco et al., 2021)</ref>. Therefore, the second aim of this study was to test whether low cognitive empathy for victims is associated with higher street harassment tolerance.</p><p>Empathy <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Atkins et al., 2016)</ref> and social dominance orientation <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Fischer, 2012)</ref> are known to vary between cultures. Our understanding of cultural influence on street harassment attitudes is under-researched despite its necessity for developing global interventions as well as interventions appropriate to a national context. To our knowledge, no study has analysed the factors contributing to men's street harassment tolerance in more than one national context. Here, we tested two Western cultures: Italy and the United Kingdom. Cultural differences in street harassment perception, frequency, and putatively related attitudes could mean that their interactions also vary between countries. A Gallup survey <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Crabtree &amp; Nsbuga, 2012)</ref> revealed that 40% of women feel safe walking alone at night in Italy, compared to 62% in the United Kingdom. In Southern European countries, such as Italy, gendered traditional values have persisted more than in Northern European countries, such as England <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bosoni &amp; Baker, 2015)</ref>. Historically, Italians have demonstrated lower levels of endorsement of established social rules, such as not swearing or criticising people in public, indulging in sexual activity and expressing emotions <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Argyle et al., 1986)</ref>. A comprehensive understanding of the nuances of cultural differences in street harassment tolerance is beyond the scope of this study. However, by independently conducting this study in two cultures, we allow for the replication of effects. This will increase confidence in identified relationships. This replication can also help to inform global campaigns and joint strategies to reduce street harassment. Differences between cultures may indicate that different approaches are needed in different countries. Therefore, the final aim is to explore the factors contributing to street harassment tolerance in two European populations, Italy and England.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.4.">Current Study</head><p>In summary, the present study aimed to start addressing the gaps within sex-based street harassment research by investigating individuals' attitudes underlying street harassment tolerance. First, we hypothesised that lower cognitive empathy for a person being harassed predicts higher street harassment tolerance in heterosexual men. Second, we hypothesised that higher SDO predicts higher street harassment tolerance in heterosexual men. These effects were tested for replication in two distinct countries.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Design</head><p>We used a correlational design, seeking to replicate effects in two online studies based on two different cultures. We tested associations between cognitive empathy, social dominance orientation, and street harassment tolerance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Participants</head><p>Data were collected in April and March 2022. The inclusion criteria were male and above 18 years old. Only data from self-identified heterosexual males were analysed. This does not imply that street harassment does not occur within and between groups of other sexual orientations and genders. However, we expected the motivations and attitudes of individuals who do not identify with the perpetrators in the video stimulus to differ from those of heterosexual males, which would cloud the interpretability of findings. The final two samples in this study are heterosexual Italian (N = 136) and British (N = 113) individuals who identified themselves as men. Tables <ref type="table">1</ref> and <ref type="table">2</ref> describe the two samples in terms of age, education, and relationships. Participant ages ranged between 18 and 77 in the Italian sample and between 19 and 68 in the British sample. Participants were recruited through Prolific 1 and by sharing the questionnaire link on social media. Prolific recruitment included individuals who had signed up for the service as participants. Prolific settings were programmed to obtain 80 Italian and 80 British male participants above 18 years old who were paid £2.70 for their time. This recruitment was supplemented by posting in Italian and British community groups on Facebook, along with a brief description of the study and an invitation to participate. Participants recruited through social media were not offered compensation.</p><p>1 Prolific is an online platform designed to assist researchers in recruiting participants for their online research. The researcher uploads the study, setting a reward per hour and adding participant criteria. The platform will display the study to the relevant users according to the study's pre-screening information.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Materials Online Questionnaire</head><p>The questionnaire was designed and delivered using Qualtrics software (Copyright © 2022 Qualtrics). To ensure full comprehension from each population, participants could choose to complete the study in English or Italian. To ensure consistency between the two translations, the English questionnaire was translated into Italian by a bilingual individual and translated back to English by a second bilingual individual. Minor discrepancies between the two translations were identified and resolved.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SDO-7 Scale</head><p>The SDO-7 scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Aiello et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Ho et al., 2015)</ref> is an adaptation of the original version by <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Pratto et al. (1994)</ref>, an established and reliable scale predicting an individual's preference for social group hierarchies and inequality. We used the more extended version containing 16 items with a 7-point Likert response scale, ranging from 1 ("strongly oppose") to 7 ("strongly favour").</p><p>Eight items refer to social dominance, and eight refer to anti-inequality. Eight items are reversed coded to reduce acquiescence and extreme response biases. Higher scores indicate higher levels of SDO. Scores on items were summed. Cronbach's alpha was .91 across both U.K. and Italian samples, indicating high internal consistency and reliability.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Street Harassment Tolerance Scale</head><p>This scale was modelled after the only attempt in the literature to measure one's street harassment tolerance <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Darnell &amp; Cook, 2009)</ref>, which in turn was patterned after <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Goodchilds and Zellman's (1984)</ref> sexual aggression acceptance measure. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Darnell and Cook's (2009)</ref> scale was taken due to its good internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = .94). This is an 11-item questionnaire containing a 5-point Likert response scale, from 1 (not at all acceptable) to 5 (very acceptable). In <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Darnell and Cook's (2009)</ref> scale, all items begin with a common incipit: "How acceptable do you think it is for a man to make an unsolicited, unreciprocated, and unnecessary comment toward an unknown woman on the street (for example, saying 'hey baby' or 'nice ass') when". Then, each item concludes with one of the following situations: the woman is attractive, the woman is dressed in sexy clothing (e.g., short skirt, tight clothes), the woman makes eye contact with him, the woman smiles at him, the woman is alone, the woman is with her friends, the woman is with a man, the woman is with her children, the man is alone, the man is with his friends, and the man is in an unfamiliar neighbourhood. In the present study, questions were slightly modified. The words "unreciprocated and unnecessary" were removed to avoid prompts. The last part was revised into "(for example, whistling and saying 'hey baby' or 'nice ass')" to capture a wider variety of street harassment behaviours. Higher scores indicated higher tolerance for street harassment.</p><p>Cronbach's alpha was .96 for the street harassment tolerance scale across both U.K. and Italian samples, indicating high internal consistency and reliability.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Video Stimulus</head><p>The video <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bliss, 2014)</ref> was taken from Rob Bliss's account on YouTube (<ref type="url" target="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1XGPvbWn0A">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1XGPvbWn0A</ref>). It lasts two minutes and shows a woman walking in New York City while being the subject of cat-calling episodes, following, and staring.</p><p>Street harassment was verbal and nonverbal, and the protagonist did not engage or express any welcome to the approaches from harassers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cognitive Empathy Scale</head><p>This scale was used to ascertain participants' understanding of the women's emotional responses. This scale is a 10-item self-reported questionnaire containing a 10-point Likert response scale, ranging from 1 (not at all) to 10 (very much). This is an adaptation of <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Fernandez and Marshall's (2003)</ref> Rapist Empathy Scale, which measures people's understanding that rape causes negative consequences for the victim. While <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Fernandez and Marshall (2003)</ref> used a vignette, these questions referred to the video watched during the survey. The common stem of the items was: "How much do you think the woman in the video was feeling". Each item concluded with one of the following: "complimented, offended, proud, ashamed, self-confident, guilty, pleased, afraid, angry, and safe". <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Darnell and Cook (2009)</ref> found that, compared to other scales, this one captures the women's experiences of street harassment based on past research <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Lenton et al., 1999)</ref> and anecdotal data <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Darnell &amp; Cook, 2009)</ref>. Higher scores indicated increased cognitive empathy, with the assumption that street harassment is experienced as a negative experience. In addition, the scores of the items referring to positive emotions and those referring to negative emotions were computed separately to form two sub-variables: Cognitive Empathy related to Positive and Negative Emotions, respectively. Cronbach's alpha was .81 for the cognitive empathy scale across both U.K. and Italian samples, indicating high internal consistency and reliability.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Procedure</head><p>The study was approved by the School of Psychology Ethics Board (application ID: ER/AG711/2). The study fully complied with British Psychological Society ethical guidelines.</p><p>Participants were asked to complete the survey independently and remotely on their computer or mobile device. Before completing the questionnaire, all participants were presented with an information and consent form, which stated their rights to withdraw, reassured the data anonymity, and contained study details. Participants were told the study would investigate the social interaction between men and women. Participants were warned they would have watched a video of males approaching a woman without invitation and were advised not to participate if they believed this would cause them severe discomfort. After consent was given, participants were taken to a captcha for the computer to verify they were human. The first part of the study collected the following demographic information: age, gender (male, female, non-binary, another gender, prefer not to say), sexual orientation (heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, another sexual orientation, prefer not to say), relationship status ("Have you ever been in a long-term romantic relationship with a female?": Yes, No, Prefer not to say), friendship group gender information ("Have you ever had a meaningful close relationship with a female that isn't sexual (for example, friend, sister, mother etc.)?": Yes, No, Prefer not to say), the composition of their friendship group (Entirely Male, Mostly Male, A mix of gender, Mostly female, Entirely Female), and the highest level of education (high school, undergraduate degree, Masters, PhD). Next, the SDO and Street Harassment Tolerance Scale were administered in random order, followed by the video. After the video, the remaining scales (Cognitive Empathy Scale, Post-video Street Harassment Tolerance Scale, and additional measures not related to the focus of this study) were administered in a randomised order. Questions from each scale were displayed in blocks. Participants could only proceed to the following battery if they answered every question currently displayed and watched the whole video. No time limit was imposed so that participants could complete the survey at their own pace. Finally, participants were debriefed and could withdraw their responses by clicking the "I do not consent to participate" option. At the end of the survey, links to mental well-being support were provided (National Health Service and University of Sussex Support Services).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Results</head><p>Table <ref type="table">3</ref> describes our dependent collected data. Table <ref type="table">4</ref> illustrates how they correlate with each other.</p><p>Five participants (one British, four Italian) with outlier pre-video street harassment tolerance ratings ( &gt; score of 41) were removed from the dataset before analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Impact of Video on Street Harassment Tolerance</head><p>The impact of the video on street harassment tolerance was expected to be conservative because of the significant number of participants providing the lowest street harassment tolerance rating before viewing the video (34 British, 64 Italian). The correlation between street harassment tolerance scores pre-and post-viewing of the video was correspondingly high (Table <ref type="table">3</ref>). The video decreased street harassment tolerance in the British sample (t(111)=-3.93 p &lt; .001, d = -.37) but not in the Italian sample, which was already relatively lower in street harassment tolerance prevideo (t(131)=-1.00, p =0.319, d = -0.087).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Psychological Predictors of Street Harassment Tolerance</head><p>Street harassment tolerance responses had a floor effect, censored at a score of 11. It was predicted that if scores could go more negative than 'not at all acceptable' in terms of opinions of street harassment, we would have a more Gaussian distribution of responses. We constructed Tobit regression models (VGAM package in R) to consider this lower censor as we tested predictive </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cognitive Empathy</head><p>The first hypothesis of this study was that cognitive empathy predicts street harassment tolerance. Participants rated the emotions felt by a female protagonist in a video experiencing street harassment. Five of these emotions were positive, and five were negative. Composite scores were calculated by reverse coding positive emotion ratings and summing all scores. Positive and negative empathy were negatively correlated (British: Spearman's r(111) = -.26, p =.005; Italian: r(134) = -.50, p &lt; .001). Positive empathy was skewed towards the lower values, and negative empathy was normally distributed around the middle rating (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). Since we wished to explore whether positive empathy, negative empathy and composite scores predicted street harassment tolerance, we examined all effects with Tobit regressions. Parameter estimates are reported in Table <ref type="table">5</ref>. The associations between composite empathy scores and street harassment tolerance are visualised in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>. Model comparison using AIC demonstrated that composite scores provided the best fit to data, so composite scores were taken forward to a combined model with SDO (Table <ref type="table">6</ref>). All effects were replicated across British and Italian samples.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Social Dominance Orientation</head><p>The second hypothesis was that a higher SDO (Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>) would predict higher street harassment tolerance. Street harassment tolerance before the video (British: b = .31, Italian: b = .31) and street harassment tolerance after the video (British: b = .30; Italian: b = .27) (ps &lt; .001) were predicted by SDO scores, replicating across samples (Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Combined Model</head><p>We then tested whether SDO and cognitive empathy contributed independently to street harassment tolerance in a regression containing both predictors (SDO and composite cognitive empathy scores). Both predictors captured significant independent variance of street harassment tolerance across individuals in both samples (Table <ref type="table">6</ref>).</p><p>Across both samples, age was positively associated with street harassment tolerance (b =.16, p =.001). Due to the age difference between British and Italian samples (t(242) = 6.5, p &lt; 001), any differences in street harassment tolerance between the British and the younger Italian sample may have been due to age rather than cultural differences and were therefore not explored in further detail. Neither education nor social relationship histories were associated with street harassment tolerance.</p><p>In a combined dataset, interaction effects between nationality and cognitive empathy or nationality and SDO were insignificant (ps &gt; .45) and did not improve the fit to data. Therefore, the association of SDO and cognitive empathy with street harassment tolerance was not considered different between the Italian and British samples.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p>This study aimed to research the relationship between cognitive empathy, SDO, and street harassment tolerance in British and Italian heterosexual male populations. Belief in relatively more positive emotions in the victim and preferences for social hierarchies and inequality were associated with greater street harassment tolerance in two distinct cultures.</p><p>This study investigated men's cognitive empathy towards a female victim's emotional experience during video-recorded street harassment episodes. The average cognitive empathy score suggested that men generally understand street harassment as a negative experience for the receiver. This corresponded to an overall low tolerance for street harassment. Within that range, however, lower cognitive empathy for the victim came with more tolerance for street harassment. This corresponds to suggestions that men who self-report harassment can be mistakenly motivated to evoke a positive response <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(DelGreco et al., 2021)</ref> and theories that sexual harassment by men is related to the perception that it is less harmful and more welcome than it actually is <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Jacques-Tiura et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Stockdale, 1993)</ref>.</p><p>The positive relationship between SDO and tolerance for street harassment could emerge from many mechanisms. SDO is a recognition and desire of dominance of one's own group over others. In one view, street harassment is an attempt to exert control over another person regardless of whether it is expected to be a positive <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(DelGreco et al., 2021)</ref> or negative <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Leonardo, 1981)</ref> experience for the victim. However, if one already feels dominance, street harassment may also be motivated by assumptions that a woman would appreciate the attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Kunstman &amp; Maner, 2011)</ref>, by the dehumanisation of outgroups <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Ho et al., 2015)</ref>, and the implementation of social scripts learned from living a patriarchal society <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Seal &amp; Ehrhardt, 2003)</ref>. With the link between SDO and street harassment tolerance established, our understanding of the relationship would benefit from further research to better understand it.</p><p>While cognitive empathy and SDO have independent associations with street harassment tolerance, the two were correlated in accord with prior literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Duckitt &amp; Sibley, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">McFarland, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Sidanius et al., 2013)</ref>. Intriguingly, SDO correlated with expectations of positive experiences of the victim, but not the negative experience -which further supports the link between power motivations and assumptions of a positive response to the harasser's attention.</p><p>The lack of a strong effect of the video on street harassment tolerance corresponded to the lack of impact of video media street harassment attitudes in prior studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Darnell &amp; Cook, 2009)</ref>. It may reflect the strong floor effect of street harassment tolerance (low tolerance) in our samples.</p><p>Empathy links to street harassment tolerance both before and after viewing the video. So, street harassment tolerance could shape empathy for the victim, as well as empathy shaping street harassment tolerance. Similarly, SDO linked to street harassment tolerance both before and after the video.</p><p>Associations of cognitive empathy and SDO were similar between British and Italian samples. While there are likely to be cultural differences in street harassment problems, there are also be common targets for preventative education between countries, including increased understanding of the negative experience of victims and reducing the application of patriarchal social hierarchies in the street.</p><p>An incidental finding was that age predicted lower street harassment tolerance and greater cognitive empathy. As societal gender dynamics evolve, so may men's attitudes, with older generations holding more conservative views toward the acceptability of street harassment. The Italian sample was younger and had greater cognitive empathy for the victim, and this may explain why the Italian sample had somewhat lower street harassment tolerance overall. To test the influence of culture on street harassment tolerance, further research is needed with the precise matching of samples for age, education, and other demographic variables. Frequencies of a romantic or meaningful relationship with a female and friendship group's gender composition and education levels had surprisingly little influence on street harassment tolerance ratings relative to individual differences in cognitive empathy and SDO in our samples.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Limitations and Future Directions</head><p>As with all studies, these two experiments had limitations and further research is needed to go beyond them. Firstly, participants were opportunistically recruited through an online recruitment platform and social media, so it is conceivable that the sampling was subjected to a selection bias <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Smart, 1966)</ref>. Future studies could employ more random sampling techniques. A second limitation of the present study is the use of self-report measures, which allows for hiding attitudes perceived as socially undesirable <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Jobe, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Schwarz &amp; Oyserman, 2001)</ref>. The anonymity of an online design mitigated this risk, but other approaches could be employed to reduce it. Third, the correlational nature of this experiment does not allow us to infer any causal relationships. Lower empathy or enhanced social dominance orientation may or may not cause street harassment tolerance. Intervention studies would provide further insight. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Diehl, Glaser, and Bohner (2014)</ref> demonstrate the feasibility of such studies, revealing that increasing perspectivetaking of victims among college students reduced their likelihood of engaging in sexual harassment and acceptance of myths related to sexual harassment. Fourth, this study suggested that nationality does not significantly change the relationship between cognitive empathy, SDO, and street harassment tolerance in two Western countries. Further research is needed, however, to understand if these attitudinal and cognitive relationships hold across a greater diversity of cultures, as well as investigate the variability of effects between cultures of the same country. Fifth, the field would benefit from research investigating allyship and empathy in other street harassment contexts, such as when the victim expresses discontent <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Magley, 2002)</ref>. Sixth, the reported link between tolerance of sexual harassment and street harassment is modest <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(DelGreco et al., 2021)</ref>, so caution is encouraged before inferring the likelihood of street harassment perpetration from SDO and empathy. Finally, street harassment can also manifest in racist, homophobic, and other discriminatory behaviour, which may share some sources with sexually motivated street harassment toward women but likely varies in its motivation and execution <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Fileborn &amp; O'Neill, 2023)</ref>. Individuals within the LGBTQ+ communities, for example, also frequently face harassment in the street <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Chmielewski, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Hollaback!)</ref>. Future research should explore how empathy and the desire for dominance contribute to these other forms of harassment and harassment by individuals other than heterosexual males.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusions</head><p>Since perpetrators and their peers are responsible for reducing harmful street harassment toward women, it is essential to understand the attitudes and cognition that underpin the phenomenon. This study represents initial insight into the independent roles of cognitive empathy and SDO in street harassment tolerance in two distinct cultures, presenting these as potential targets for positive social change.

Predictions of Street Harassment Tolerance were completed both before and after viewing the video. Model comparison used the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) to select the simplest, best-fitting model, where appropriate. Models were fit separately to British and Italian samples. Adding main effects or interactions of age, friendship group gender balance, and education failed to improve the fit to street harassment tolerance in any national sample, and so the simpler models without these covariates were reported.</figDesc></figure>
