<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>To successfully perform everyday activities, cognitive functions such as working memory (WM) and selective attention are necessary. Specifically, when environmental demands are dynamic, exogenous attention is crucial. However, its ability to select and prioritize not only perceptual spatial locations, but also novel stimulus-response (S-R) bindings held in WM remains largely unexplored. By implementing a retro-cueing paradigm on a task that capitalized on WM, the present experiment's aim was two-fold: i) to evaluate whether exogenous cueing effects would not only impact spatial processing but also WM content, and ii) to explore how meta-control states induced by the manipulation of an intervening event (IE) would modulate these effects. We observed (N=50) that exogenous attention led to selection of space, as it is usually observed in spatial exogenous attention paradigms, but also the content associated with that location. Moreover, space selection was modulated by the IE manipulation, which was thought to induce two meta-control states (persistent vs. flexible). As such, the presence of the IE also modulated participants' performance regarding novel vs. repeated stimulus-response mappings, again hinting at an important role of content in this task. This pattern of findings fits well with the concept of event file; a mental representation of all relevant components assembled at the beginning of a trial (i.e., cue, target, lateralization, meta-control state, etc.), which are retrieved together once one or more of its elements are encountered. Although preliminary, this evidence of exogenous attentional selection of WM through event file activation paves the way for a promising research line.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Humans tend to take for granted everyday activities by forgetting the actual complexity that they entail. For us, activities like following a recipe are trivial, but a cascade of cognitive functions must be triggered in our minds to achieve it. First, we must voluntarily guide our attention to look for the ingredients in the refrigerator. This is referred to as endogenous/voluntary attention and allows us to select and prioritize relevant information based on goals or preexisting information by biasing sensory recruitment in a top-down/goal-directed manner <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Corbetta, Patel &amp; Shulman, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Jonides, 1981)</ref>. Additionally, some external stimuli, like the strident sound of the oven timer, will automatically attract our attention. This form of bottom-up attentional selection is known as exogenous/involuntary attention and is essential in our adaptation to environmental demands <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Jonides, 1981;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Posner &amp; Cohen, 1984)</ref>.</p><p>Lastly, to successfully cook the dish, we must maintain in our working memory <ref type="bibr">(WM)</ref> the specific actions to be executed and their specific order. This temporal storage of information guides flexible and adaptive behavior by manipulating data in an online fashion <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Baddeley, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Souza &amp; Oberauer, 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Hence, given the relevance of these cognitive functions for the execution of most daily activities, they have been the spotlight of several seminal and review papers (see e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Awh, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Baddeley &amp; Hitch, 1974;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Oberauer, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Posner, 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">van Ede &amp; Nobre, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Wolfe, 1994)</ref>. Particularly, relative to research dedicated to externally directed attention for perception, research on internally directed attention to WM contents is exponentially growing in the recent years (see e.g., Huynh <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Cong &amp; Kerzel, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Kiyonaga &amp; Egner, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Myers, Stokes &amp; Nobre, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">van Ede, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Zokaei et al., 2019)</ref>. Several authors <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Gazzaley &amp; Nobre, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Griffin &amp; Nobre, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Gunseli et al., 2015</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Gunseli et al., , 2019;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Landman et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr">Rerko, Souza &amp; Oberauer, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Souza, Rerko &amp; Oberauer, 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">, 2015)</ref> have shown that it is possible to guide attention internally and retrospectively towards WM contents in a top-down fashion.</p><p>Specifically, paradigms that implement retro-cueing (i.e., cues are presented between the offset of memory array and the onset of a probe) have shown effective internal attentional selection of WM contents <ref type="bibr">(Rerko, Souza &amp; Oberauer, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Shepherdson, Oberauer &amp; Souza, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Souza &amp; Oberauer, 2016)</ref>. However, most have focused on endogenous/voluntary attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Gunseli, van Moorselaar, Meeter, &amp; Olivers, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Gunseli et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">Rerko, Souza &amp; Oberauer, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Shepherdson, Oberauer &amp; Souza, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Souza &amp; Oberauer, 2016)</ref>, and, although some authors even suggest that the retro-cueing effect can be observed with bottom-up (although predictive) retro-cues <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Berryhill et al. 2012)</ref>, research implementing pure exogenous/involuntary retro-cues (i.e., automatic spatially driven and non-predictive) remains quite scarce (see <ref type="bibr">Fuentes-Guerra Toral et al., 2025;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Han &amp; Ku, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Han et al., 2023)</ref>.</p><p>Parallelly, research on exogenous/involuntary attention has mostly focused on human perception through the spatial domain, by mostly implementing versions of the classical Spatial Orienting Paradigm <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Chica et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr">2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Posner, 1980)</ref>.</p><p>Essentially, two main effects tend to be observed depending on the cue-target onset asynchronies (CTOAs): facilitation (i.e., faster reaction times (RTs) for target at cued as compared to uncued locations) at short CTOAs, and Inhibition of Return (IOR; an attentional cost at previously-cued locations) at longer CTOAs <ref type="bibr">(Lupiáñez, Martín-Arévalo &amp; Chica, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Posner and Cohen, 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Posner et al., 1985)</ref>. However, not only CTOAs must be considered to observe and modulate theses effects, but other key factors such as task settings, type of task (e.g., detection vs. discrimination tasks; observing more facilitation in the latter), or the presence of an intervening event (IE; i.e., a flash at fixation between cue and target, which reduces that facilitation and favors the observation of IOR, especially in discrimination tasks; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Chica et al., 2014</ref> for a review). Critically, until now, works on this paradigm <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Lupiáñez et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Martín-Arévalo, Chica &amp; Lupiáñez, 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">, Martín-Arévalo et al., 2021)</ref> have paid little attention to the content of the stimuli presented in the task, as a key factor in the interaction between attention and WM. Some authors, however, already hint at a relation between exogenous/involuntary attention and WM contents <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Botta et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Hu &amp; Samuel, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Hu, Samuel &amp; Chan, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Spadaro, He, &amp; Milliken, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">van Ede, Board and Nobre, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr">Fuentes-Guerra et al., 2025)</ref>. For instance, van Ede, Board and <ref type="bibr">Nobre (2020)</ref> showed that involuntary retro-cues (but central and symbolic, with 50% predictability) led to the selection of WM contents.</p><p>However, this relationship with purely exogenous retro-cues remains largely unexplored. In a recent set of experiments <ref type="bibr">(Fuentes-Guerra Toral et al., 2025)</ref>, we manipulated exogenous cueing, CTOAs and stimulus-response (S-R) associations and we obtained robust evidence that spatially driven exogenous non-predictive retrocues seem to select and prioritize complex WM contents by showing a facilitation effect. In this line, the Binding and Retrieval in Action Control (BRAC; <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Frings et al., 2020)</ref> provides a common ground for the integration of research on visual search, attentional selection and action control, which fits very well with the cue-target integration theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Lupiáñez, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Lupiáñez et al., 2013)</ref> in explaining such exogenous/involuntary effects. It suggests that features of the stimulus environment, a response in that environment and its subsequent effects are integrated into an "event file": a "mental representation" in which all the elements related to a specific event are included (Theory of Event Coding (TEC); <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Hommel, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr">2019)</ref>. In this regard, by elements we mean the encoding of some content (as in retro-cueing WM paradigms), the potential exogenous retro-cue, the content itself (e.g., stimulus, response, the laterality of the response, etc.) as well as the meta-control state and goals adopted when performing the specific task at hand <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Dignath et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Hommel, 2019</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Hommel, , 2022;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Whitehead, Pfeuffer &amp; Egner, 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Concerning meta-control states in particular, it has been theorized that a task can be approached in a continuum between two modes <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Hommel, 2019</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Hommel, , 2022))</ref>: one characterized by extreme persistence (with strong impact of the current goal and strong mutual competition between alternative decisions; cognitive/behavioral exploitation); and, the opposite case, where there is extreme flexibility (the current goals have a weak impact and poor competition; cognitive/behavioral exploration) <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Dreisbach &amp; Fröber, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Hommel, 2019)</ref>. In fact, the attentional state with which the person approaches the task, that is, the meta-control state, can be induced through experimental manipulations in spatial exogenous attention. Martín-Arévalo and colleagues (2021) showed that -by using a classical spatial exogenous cueing paradigm -different attentional sets could be induced by manipulating the percentage of trials in which an IE was present in a discrimination task. Specifically, the presence of an IE in most trials changed the net exogenous effect into less positive/facilitatory (or more negative values/IOR effect). That is, the IE affected in a global manner how cue and target were integrated, leading to less integration and consequently, less facilitatory effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Lupiáñez, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Lupiáñez et al., 2013)</ref>. In the context of retro-cueing paradigms, the presentation of an IE, by hindering retro-cue and target integration, could lead to a more explorative meta-control state.</p><p>Conversely, the absence of IE, through a more straightforward integration of retrocue and target, could lead to a more exploitative state where goals have a stronger impact. Summarizing, the current preregistered study builds upon recent theoretical proposals about selective attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Myers et al., 2017</ref>; cue-target integration theory in the spatial domain, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Lupiáñez, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Lupiáñez et al., 2013)</ref>, and the BRAC and TEC models <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Frings et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Hommel, 2019)</ref> to investigate how pure exogenous retrocues; i.e., spatially driven exogenous non-predictive retro-cues, can select both spatial location and WM contents. The main aim is to conceptualize the phenomenon more extensively by exploring how it is modulated by the induced meta-control states (manipulating IEs across blocks) in WM contents (i.e., by presenting novel as compared to repeated content across trials, that have proven to modulate exogenous effects in classical exogenous experiments in the perceptual domain). Specifically, based on Hommel's proposal of partial repetition costs <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Hommel, 2004</ref>) -which refers to the cognitive load or processing difficulty experienced when only some elements of a task are repeated as opposed to all elements or none -, we hypothesized that exogenous retro-cues would prioritize both the location and associated object held in WM, resulting in the fastest RTs when both were retro-cued (i.e., retro-cue in the same location as the target and selected object the same as target -Cued Location, Cued Object; CLCO-), secondly, when none of them was retrocued (i.e., retro-cue in the opposite location as the target and selected object different from the target -Uncued Location, Uncued Object; ULUO-); and last, responses being slowest in the two possible cases when one of them was retro-cued but not the other (i.e., retro-cue in the same location as target and selected object different from the target -Cued Location, Uncued Object; CLUO-or retro-cue in the opposite location as the target and selected object same as the target -Uncued Location, Cued Object; ULCO-) .</p><p>Secondly, considering the event file as a representation that contains all the information of the trial, pure exogenous effects can lead to behavioral facilitation under a persistent meta-control state and, in contrast, reduce the facilitation/or increase IOR under a flexibility bias (Martín-Arévalo, <ref type="bibr">Chica, &amp; Lupiáñez, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Martín-Arévalo et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">2021)</ref>. We hypothesized that the absence of IE would lead to a persistent meta-control state (by inducing a facilitatory effect), while the induction of a flexible meta-control state via the presence of IE might favor top-down segregation (IOR effect). Specifically, we expected that meta-control states would modulate the effect of exogenous attention on retro-cued locations but not content since the IE was spatial in nature <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Hu et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">2011)</ref>.</p><p>Additionally, we also hypothesized that the experimentally induced metacontrol states would modulate the retrieval of novel (WM) vs. repeated S-R mappings <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Dreisbach &amp; Fröber, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Hommel, 2015)</ref>. Specifically, differences between novel and repeated S-Rs were expected to be larger in no-IEs than IEs blocks, given the increased flexibility in the latter. By lowering the updating threshold in WM <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Dreisbach &amp; Fröber, 2019)</ref>, this induced flexibility could result in more similar RTs in both conditions (novel and repeated) compared to when there is no continuous disruption of information integration, less flexibility and a more goal-directed mindset from which repeated trials should specially benefit. Lastly, we expected novelty (novel or repeated content across trials) to modulate the strength with which exogenous attention prioritizes both space and content <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Whitehead, Pfeuffer &amp; Egner, 2020)</ref>, in this sense, the interaction between the location and object cueing should be larger in novel trials compared to repeated trials since the content component of the event file should be more critical for optimal behavior in the former case <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Summerfield &amp; Egner, 2009)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head><p>Data Availability. Raw data and analysis scripts for this experiment can be found at (https://osf.io/gz8ja/?view_only=2bd63bc8915e402a8749057149a0e45d).</p><p>The hypotheses and analysis plan were preregistered prior to data collection and can be found at https://aspredicted.org/SQ7_83V.</p><p>Participants. Fifty-seven naïve volunteers participated in this experiment, although seven of them were excluded from the analyses due to an error rate higher than 40% in regular and catch trials (see preregistration). Thus, the final sample size was 50 (40 females, mean age of 21.1 years, SD=3.1). We determined the sample size a priori, based on previous experiments using a similar spatial exogenous Inside of each placeholder an image of 200 x 200 pixels appeared at the beginning of each trial. These images of animate (non-human animals) and inanimate (vehicles and instruments) items were compiled from different available databases <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Brady et al., 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Brady et al., , 2013;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Brodeur et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Griffin et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Konkle et al., 2010)</ref>, creating a pool of 1550 unique pictures (770 animate items, 780 inanimate). To increase perceptual distinctiveness and facilitate recognition, the background was removed from all images, items were centered in the canvas, and images were converted to black and white. Additionally, we created peripheral cues by increasing the outline of one of two placeholder boxes from 10 to 30 pixels. Moreover, the IE was created by presenting a smaller box of 175 x 175 pixels centered around the fixation point.</p><p>The experiment consisted of a choice-reaction task embedded in an pure exogenous retro-cueing paradigm. The sequence of events in each trial is illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>. Each trial began with the presentation of the encoding display -containing the fixation point, the two placeholders and two images-for a duration of 1000 ms.</p><p>Participants were instructed to encode (or retrieve, see below) a stimulus-response (S-R) mapping in which they had to associate each stimulus with a specific bimanual response depending on its location on the screen. Specifically, participants were instructed at the beginning of the experimental session to associate stimuli to the left of the fixation point to bimanual index finger responses, and stimuli to the right to bimanual middle finger responses and to ignore any additional stimuli that could possibly appear between encoding and probe presentation (i.e.. the retro-cue and the IE, see below). The location-response contingency was constant during the experiment but counterbalanced across participants. Bimanual index and middle responses were used to fully orthogonalize the location of the stimulus on the screen with the response location. In 50% of the trials, a completely new pair of images appeared and therefore S-R associations were new ("novel S-Rs"). Novel mappings never repeated and appeared only once throughout the experiment. In the remaining 50% of trials, the same two images were displayed always in the same position, thus leading to the exact same pair of S-R associations throughout the whole experimental session, which we labeled "repeated S-Rs". Next, an interval, composed by the two empty placeholders and the fixation point, appeared for 500ms (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Souza &amp; Oberauer, 2016)</ref>. Immediately after, the peripheral non-predictive retro-cue was presented for 50 ms in one of the two possible locations with equal probability (50%;</p><p>i.e., totally unpredictive for both location and object). After the peripheral retro-cue had disappeared, a fixation display was presented for a jittered duration of 400-500 ms. Additionally, in one of the two blocks, an IE would flash for 50 ms on the fixation point. In IE absent blocks, the fixation cross (without flash) was displayed for the same duration to warrant identical retro-cue/target latencies across blocks. Another fixation display was then presented for 400-500 ms. Then, one of the two images (i.e. the target image) was displayed for 1200 ms in one of the two placeholders with equal probability. Participants were instructed to provide the associated response learned at the encoding stage of the trial. Specifically, they had to simultaneously press the "S" and "L" keys on the keyboard with both middle fingers if the target was associated with middle fingers' responses, and "D" and "K" with both index fingers simultaneously if index fingers responses were required. In 5% of trials, a completely new picture, different from the two displayed in the encoding screen, and never seen before, was shown as the target. In those cases, which we labeled "catch trials", participants were instructed to press the spacebar with their thumbs. These trials were included to prevent participants from adopting strategies to reduce the WM load (e.g., encoding just the left item and then treating the target as a go-no go task).</p><p>The inter-trial interval, in which the screen remained empty, lasted 1000-1500 ms. Participants completed 2 blocks (in counterbalanced order across participants), one with IEs (100% of trials) and one without IEs (0%), of 168 trials each (160 regular trials, 8 catch ones), for a total of 336 trials. For each cell of the design (see below), participants performed 20 regular trials.</p><p>Prior to the main task, participants performed a practice phase with a similar task that did not include retro-cues nor IEs. This practice phase consisted of one block of 16 trials (14 regular and 2 catch), which participants repeated until they achieved an accuracy of at least 85%. The images used in the practice phase were not used during the main task. The total duration of the experiment was around 40 minutes.</p><p>Design. The experiment consisted of a 2x2x2x2 full factorial design of four factors in which all variables were counterbalanced within participants: location cueing, object cueing and novelty (all manipulated within trials), and IE (manipulated across blocks).</p><p>Location cueing had two levels: cued location (the target appeared in the same location as the retro-cue) and uncued location (the target appeared in the opposite location of the retro-cue). As such, object cueing also had two levels: cued object (the target was the object selected by the retro-cue) and uncued object (the target was the object not selected by the retro-cue). Moreover, S-Rs could be novel (for uniquely presented objects) or repeated across trials (for repeated S-R mappings, i.e., for two stimuli which appeared in 50% of the trials always in the same location). Lastly, the IE could be present or absent, but in this case, it was manipulated across blocks (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Martín-Arévalo et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">2021)</ref>, with the order counterbalanced between participants.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical analyses</head><p>To test our hypothesis, we performed 21 Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMM) (see e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Lo &amp; Andrews, 2015)</ref> with the raw RT data of correct regular trials (catch trials were excluded) that didn't exceed 1200 ms (8.75% of rejected trials).</p><p>First, to find the most appropriate random structure, we computed three models. The first model included the random intercept of participant and trial, the second one, the random intercept of participant and, the last one, the random intercept of trial 1 . Once 1 Given the complexity of the experimental design, random slopes were not included since convergence issues were raised. Nevertheless, a classical ANOVA (see https://osf.io/gz8ja/? view_only=2bd63bc8915e402a8749057149a0e45d) was carried out and the pattern of results mainly mimicked the one reported below in the results section. we compared these models by performing an ANOVA, the model with both the random intercept of participant and trial had the smallest AIC and BIC (AIC= 18976.2, BIC=187120.4), and therefore, it was chosen as the model with the most suited random structure. Consequently, we modeled the fixed effects of the model by comparing the model which included the most complex interaction among independent variables to its subsequent one, and so on. After carrying out 18 additional models, we identified the best fixed structure. The selected model included the random intercept of both participant and trial as random structure and for the fixed structure the model comprised an interaction between location cueing and object cueing, an interaction between IE and location cueing, and last, an interaction between IE and novelty. Within this model, we performed an analysis of deviance on RT. All data processing and analyses were carried out with RStudio 2022.02.3 and JASP 0.14.0.0. B. We also performed some exploratory analyses regarding accuracy scores (see https://osf.io/gz8ja/?view_only=2bd63bc8915e402a8749057149a0e45d) and catch trials.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Note. SD: Standard Deviation</head><p>Regarding the first preregistered hypothesis (https://aspredicted.org/eg7tc.pdf), where we expected pure exogenous retro-cues to modulate not only spatial representation but also the content held in working memory (WM), there was a significant interaction between Location Cueing and Object Cueing [X^2(1,N=50)= 224.32, p&lt;.001], with faster RTs when the retro-cue selected both the target's location and the object [CLCO] (M=672 ms; SD=102 ms); next, when the retro-cue didn't select any of them [ULUO] (M=683 ms; SD=102 ms); on the third place, when the retro-cue selected the location but not the object [CLUO] (M=709 ms; SD=94 ms); and lastly, when it selected the object but not the   We also obtained evidence for the second hypothesis, which predicted an interaction between Location Cueing and IE [X^2(1,N=50)=13.29, p&lt;.001]. In this line, the pairwise comparisons revealed a significant difference between cued location trials (M=695 ms ; SD=99 ms) vs. uncued location trials (M=711 ms; SD=99) when IE was absent [X^2(1,N=50)=-14.71, p&lt;.001]. In contrast, when IE was present, there were no statistically significant differences between cued and uncued location trials [X^2(1,N=50)=3.16, p=.789] (See Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref>). Lastly, the interaction of IE and Object Cueing was not part of the selected model and therefore, it was not further tested.  The last hypothesis predicted a three-way interaction between Location Cueing, Object Cueing and Novelty. Nevertheless, this effect was not part of the selected model, so it was not further tested.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>These results suggest that pure exogenous attention selects and prioritizes different contents included in an event file held in WM. In particular, it reveals that exogenous cues can equally select two of the main components of event files: location and object. This is evidenced by the significant difference between CLCO and CLUO, and between CLCO and ULUO. Additionally, these results also align with BRAC and TEC models <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Frings et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Hommel, 2019)</ref>, and with the partial repetition costs hypothesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Hommel, 2004)</ref>: full repetitions of the encoded event file (CLCO or ULUO), led to faster responses, wherein participants had to accept or just reject the event file. However, in partial repetitions (CLUO or ULCO), participants had to partially update the event files leading to longer responses. This outcome presents critical implications for the understanding on how attentional selection interacts with WM contents since it suggests that all the different features presented on each trial are encoded and retrieved as whole, and this can be triggered automatically by retrocueing one of its dimensions (space/location), although this default activation can lead to slower RTs when there is some conflicting information. Similar effects have been reported in many other domains, like in priming studies with different types of tasks <ref type="bibr">(Mayr et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Sohn &amp; Anderson, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Zehetleitner, Rangelov, &amp; Müller, 2012)</ref>.</p><p>In contrast, it could be argued that the pattern of results observed in the current study could be based on encoding-probe congruency rather than being a retro-cueing effect. That is, the fact that the encoded stimuli could be repeated at the same location from encoding to probe could facilitate its retrieval. Nevertheless, this explanation does not account for the statistically significant difference in RTs between CLCO and ULUO. According to the encoding-probe congruency interpretation participants should be equally fast in these two conditions since there is a full repetition of object and location from encoding to probe. However, this is certainly not the case. Participants were significantly faster for CLCO than for ULUO, which suggests that the retro-cue prioritized the selected content. Additionally, this aligns with recent evidence where this encoding-probe spatial congruency was eliminated by centralizing the probe, obtaining robust evidence for a pure exogenous retro-cueing effect <ref type="bibr">(Fuentes-Guerra et al., 2025)</ref>. However, whether this retrocueing effect is based on a benefit from cued trials and/or a cost from uncued trials can not be disentangled here since neutral retro-cues were not included. The inclusion of neutral retro-cues should be considered in future experiments to clearly distinguish between these two possibilities.</p><p>Furthermore, following the idea of event file, in which the different elements of the trial are interrelated, as expected, IE interacted with Location Cueing. More specifically, in a task that capitalized on WM contents, a significant facilitatory effect was observed, just like in the classical spatial exogenous paradigm especially when using discrimination tasks (Martín-Arévalo, <ref type="bibr">Chica, &amp; Lupiáñez, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Martín-Arévalo et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">2021)</ref>. In the IE absent block we observed a significant facilitation effect, which aligns with a persistent meta-control state <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Martín-Arévalo et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Hommel, 2019)</ref>, and thus cognitive, and behavioral exploitation, which in turn led to faster responses in cued trials. On the other hand, the expected IOR on the IE present block was not present, although no significant facilitation was observed (i.e., we observed, as alternatively expected, less positive/facilitatory effect). We predicted IEs to induce a flexible meta-control state, and therefore, cognitive, and behavioral exploration, resulting in faster responses in uncued trials. The obtained results -in terms of facilitation (significant in the IE absent and non-significant in the IE present trials, but no IOR) -may be explained by the difficulty/demands of the current task <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Chica et al., 2014)</ref>, which are higher than those in the classical exogenous spatial tasks in which this effect has been seen, and wherein longer facilitation effects are usually observed <ref type="bibr">(Lupiáñez et al., 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Martín-Arévalo et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">2016)</ref>.</p><p>Alternatively, if IOR is the result of a detection cost <ref type="bibr">(Lupiáñez et al., 2023)</ref>, which is specially apparent when the spatial selection benefits are eliminated by the IE, no detection cost would be present in this task as both the cued and the uncued objects and location are already detected and encoded into WM. Future research should investigate whether IOR also operates in the reactivation or retrieval of WM representations, or just in the detection of perceptual representations for their encoding into WM.</p><p>As it was also hypothesized, IE interacted with Location Cueing but not with Object Cueing. This may be explained by the fact that the implemented IE was purely spatial and consequently, it already shared a dimension with that type of cueing. In fact, location has proven to be a critical dimension when considering exogenous attentional modulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Hu et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">2011)</ref>. Nevertheless, this remains as an open question that could be tested with a content related IE <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Law, Pratt &amp; Abrams, 1995)</ref>.</p><p>Conversely, as also expected, the effect of IE did interact with WM contents.</p><p>Under the hypothesized persistent meta-control state <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Hommel, 2019)</ref>, the difference between novel and repeated trials was larger as compared to blocks with IE (where behavioral flexibility, in which there is a weaker influence of the goal, was expected).</p><p>In IE present trials, in contrast, a more explorative state could support better performance in novel trials <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Dreisbach &amp; Fröber, 2019)</ref>. These results imply that the metacontrol state with which participants approach the task doesn't only affect the impact of the exogenous retro-cue on their performance, but also, the ease with which they are able to discriminate between novel and more declarative/long term memory (LTM) contents, which can also, in turn, be part of that explorative or exploitative mindset, respectively. In this context, regarding novel (WM) and repeated trials, it could be argued that the WM demands of the task in both conditions might be altered as the repeated stimuli could be well-stored in LTM.</p><p>Nevertheless, even if this was the case, we argue that when the stimuli were repeated, the task should still engage WM mechanisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Ranganath, &amp; D'Esposito, 2001)</ref> through active maintenance and manipulation of that information trial-by-trial <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Jonides et al., 2008)</ref>, since the participants did not know in advance the exact type of trial (novel or repeated) that could be presented.</p><p>Last, we hypothesized that Novelty would modulate the strength with which exogenous attention prioritizes both space and content, based on Whitehead and collaborators (2020), who found reduced task-switching costs for probes whose primes were task switches as opposed to repeat trials. Nevertheless, this effect was not present in our results. One possible explanation is that, in this task, several factors that could induce cognitive and behavioral exploration/exploitation were included (Novelty and IE), hence, the modulatory effect of Novelty and its supposed induced flexibility, might be hindered under the complexity of the design and the variability within so many interactions. Future research could address this issue by evaluating the effects of Novelty on exogenous attention in isolation, avoiding the inclusion of additional factors. This would allow testing whether novelty exerts a modulatory effect in the absence of other overarching influences.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>Exogenous attention selected and prioritized both space and associated WM contents, challenging previous conceptualizations. Additionally, pure exogenous effects have proven to influence content integration. In fact, task elements like IE can induce meta-control states, leading to varied results based on task settings.</p><p>Therefore, it seems that event files encompass trial elements beyond space, facilitating stimulus interaction but may activate irrelevant information, and that these elements can be prioritized within WM via purely exogenous cues.</p></div>

Participants were recruited through the experiments' website (https://ugrcimcyc.sona-systems.com) of the research center where the study took place, the Centro de Investigación Mente, Cerebro y Comportamiento (CIMCYC). The prerequisites for participation in the present study were to be above 18 years old, to have normal or corrected to normal vision and to give a written consent. Moreover, participants were monetarily compensated (5€ per half an hour) after completing their partaking. The experiment was conducted in accordance with the ethical guidelines laid down by the Department of Experimental Psychology, University of Granada, in conformity with the ethical standards of the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki (last update: Brazil, 2013). The experiment was part of a larger research project approved by the University of Granada Ethical Committee (1816/CEIH/2020). Apparatus, stimuli, and procedure. We conducted the experiment on a computer with an Intel Core i7-3770 CPU @ 3.40GHz x8 processor, connected to a 24 inches Benq XL2411T monitor with a 1920x1080 (16:9) pixel resolution and 350 cd/m² of brightness. Participants sat at a viewing distance of approximately 65 cm. The presentation of stimuli and data acquisition were controlled with PsychoPy 2021.2.3 throughout the whole experiment. The experimental display consisted in the presentation of two placeholders, one on each side of the fixation point, which was presented right in the middle of the screen (position [relative to the center] of x = 0, y = 0). Each placeholder box had a size of 200 x 200 pixels, and the border of the box comprised an extra 10 pixels. The left box was in the position (x = -250, y = 75) and the right one in (x= 250, y = 75).</figDesc></figure>
