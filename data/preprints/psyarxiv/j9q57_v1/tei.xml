<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Theoretical and empirical accounts of conduct disorder (CD) suggest problems with reinforcement learning as well as heightened impulsivity. These two facets can manifest in similar behaviour, such as risk-taking. Computational models that can dissociate learning from impulsively initiating actions are essential for understanding the cognitive mechanisms underlying CD. Here, a large, international sample of youths from 11 European countries (N = 1418, typically developing (TD) n = 742, CD n = 676) completed a passive avoidance learning task. We used computational modelling to disentangle reward and punishment learning from action initiation. Punishment learning rates were significantly reduced in youths with CD compared to their TD peers, suggesting that they did not update their actions based on punishment outcomes as strongly. Intriguingly, those with CD also had a greater tendency to initiate actions regardless of outcomes, although their ability to learn from reward was comparable to their TD peers. We additionally observed that variability in action initiation correlated with self-reported impulsivity in youths with CD. These findings provide empirical support for a reduced ability to learn from punishment in CD, while reward learning is typical. Our results also suggest that behaviours appearing superficially to reflect reward learning differences could reflect heightened impulsive action initiation instead. Such asymmetric learning from reward and punishment, with increased action initiation, could have important implications for tailoring learningbased interventions to help those with CD.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Approximately 2% of children and adolescents in Europe 1 exhibit persistent antisocial, defiant, and aggressive behaviour severe enough to qualify for a diagnosis of conduct disorder (CD). The social and economic costs of CD are high <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> . Furthermore, CD is often associated with the core callous-unemotional affective features of psychopathy (e.g., lack of empathy and remorse) <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> . Many youths, especially those with the most marked callous-unemotional characteristics, will continue to exhibit antisocial behaviour in adulthood and eventually be diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> . An improved understanding of CD, and the role of callous-unemotional traits in its presentation, is therefore a priority.</p><p>Youths with CD might struggle to learn from punishment and reward. Insensitivity to punishment cues was one of the first cognitive features of antisocial behaviour to be verified empirically <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> and is strongly associated with psychopathy in adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> . In children, CD has been associated with insensitivity to parental discipline, especially when the child has high levels of callous-unemotional traits <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> . Task-based measures of reinforcement learning also highlight difficulties in learning from punishment <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> , although these difficulties are not always present <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> . More rarely, behavioural hypersensitivity to reward has been reported <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> , although in 'risk-taking' rather than standard reinforcement learning contexts, where reward and punishment-related processes cannot easily be distinguished. Studies using various other learning contexts have not reported differences in reward learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> (but see <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> ). However, evidence from parenting research highlights that children with conduct problems are responsive to parental praise and encouragement <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> , suggesting that reward learning, if not heightened, is at least unlikely to be diminished in CD.</p><p>Although it is generally accepted that CD is associated with difficulties in learning from punishment and perhaps also with changes in reward sensitivity, the precise nature of these difficulties is still debated <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> . In particular, analytical methods that rely on summary statistics are usually not well suited to isolating learning processes from related but distinct phenomena, such as subjective valuation of outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> or certain forms of impulsivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> . In comparison, computational modelling can distinguish between different latent processes that are associated with similar overt behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> . For example, reinforcement learning models, which assume that actions and outcomes become associated through experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> , can distinguish between learning rates (the extent to which recent outcomes influence future choices) and non-learning parameters such as action initiation biases <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> . These parameter values are influenced by the task demands as well as participant characteristics <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> , but can nonetheless provide useful insights into underlying cognitive processes within specific learning contexts.</p><p>To date, very few studies have taken a computational approach to studying reward and punishment learning in CD. In an fMRI study of passive avoidance learning (i.e., learning to respond to rewarding objects and withhold responses to punishing objects), White and colleagues 28 demonstrated a weaker association between ventromedial prefrontal cortex activity and expected outcome value in youths with CD than in typically developing (TD) controls. However, learning rates were fixed at a set rate, which did not allow for modelling of group differences (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> ). A more recent study used a probabilistic reinforcement learning task <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> . In this study, youths with CD had significantly lower learning rates than TD controls for punishment stimuli. However, there was no difference in either direction when learning from reward, or for neutral stimuli, suggesting a specific difficulty with punishment learning. Thus, the small amount of computational modelling work to date supports an association with punishment learning difficulties, but no clear evidence for reduced (or heightened) learning from reward.</p><p>One possible reason for inconsistent findings regarding reward learning is that existing studies often have not distinguished reward learning from the tendency to initiate actions without regard to outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> , although recent evidence suggests distinct developmental trajectories for these processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> . This means that differences in reward responding in some situations could reflect differences in the tendency to initiate actions rather than reward learning per se. Several previous studies have also relied on relatively small sample sizes (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> ).</p><p>In the current study, we sought to overcome these limitations by testing a large, wellcharacterised, mixed-sex sample from multiple countries, using an experimental paradigm and computational modelling procedure that enabled us to separate reward learning from action initiation. We used a passive avoidance learning task, a classic paradigm in psychopathy and CD research <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> , from which much of the evidence for punishment learning difficulties or insensitivity has been derived <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> . Unlike probabilistic reinforcement learning tasks, in which participants must make a response on each trial, passive avoidance tasks involve learning to inhibit as well as to make responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> . This difference is particularly relevant to the question of reward hypersensitivity in CD, since impulsivity -frequently concomitant with CD <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> -can be separated from reward learning in a passive avoidance learning context <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> . Despite the centrality of passive avoidance learning in the literature, no studies to date have applied computational modelling in this learning context (except <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> , which did not model learning rates for individual participants). Here, we used computational models of reinforcement learning to quantify differences in reward and punishment learning and impulsive action initiation biases. The large sample also enabled us to examine whether variability in computational parameters was related to self-reported impulsive and callous-unemotional traits, which are highly co-morbid with CD 5 , or to CD severity.</p><p>We predicted that youths with CD would exhibit lower levels of learning from punishment (i.e., lower punishment learning rates) relative to TD peers. We did not make a directional hypothesis about reward learning rates due to the mixed findings in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> . Likewise, action initiation biases have not previously been studied in CD.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods and Materials</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>Participants were selected from the FemNAT-CD dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> . This dataset consists of youths aged 9-18 years old who were either TD or met the criteria for CD. Full inclusion and exclusion criteria are detailed in the Supplementary materials, Inclusion and exclusion criteria. Participants were selected for the current analyses if they had data from a passive avoidance learning task. The total number of eligible participants was 1574. Of these, 156 were excluded due to problems with data quality (see Supplementary materials, Exclusions due to data quality). This left a final sample of 1418 participants (676 with CD (411 females), 742 TD (491 females)). As a control analysis, we repeated the main analyses with all 1574 participants, which did not change our conclusions (see Supplementary materials, Table <ref type="table">S2</ref>). Demographic characteristics of the sample and subgroups are shown in Supplementary materials, Table <ref type="table">S1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Questionnaire measures</head><p>Participants were assessed for current and past psychiatric disorders, including CD, using the K-SADS-PL clinical interview <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> . Impulsive and callous-unemotional traits were assessed using the self-report Youth Psychopathic traits Inventory 36 (YPI). We used the YPI impulsiveness subscale as a measure of impulsivity and the callousness, unemotionality, and remorselessness subscales as the measure of callousunemotional traits. IQ was assessed with the vocabulary and matrix reasoning subscales of the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence 37 , the vocabulary, block design, and matrix reasoning subscales of the Wechsler Scale for Children, or the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale 38 according to site and age-specific protocols. Pubertal stage was assessed using the self-report Pubertal Developmental Scale (PDS <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39</ref> ). Socioeconomic status (SES) was assessed based on parental income, education, and occupation. Full details of the questionnaire measures are available in Supplementary materials, Questionnaire measures. Imputation of missing data for all of the above measures is described in Supplementary materials, Imputation of missing data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Passive Avoidance Learning task</head><p>Participants completed a passive avoidance learning task on a computer in a quiet testing room. The task was adapted from Blair and colleagues 31 using stimuli from Wong and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40</ref> and presented in E-Prime <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41</ref> . The aim of the task was to gain points by pressing a button when presented with 'good' objects (to earn points) and withholding responses when presented with 'bad' objects (to avoid losing points). To maximise their point score, participants had to learn through trial-and-error which objects were associated with reward and which with punishment. There were eight different objects in total, four associated with rewards and four with punishment, with values of +/-1, 700, 1400, or 2000 points. The point value associated with each object was fixed and did not change throughout the task. The eight objects were each presented 10 times in a random order (thus 80 trials in total). Each response was followed by feedback on the number of points gained or lost plus the running total; when participants did not respond, the value of the object was not revealed (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Stimuli were displayed for 3000ms or until the participant responded, and feedback (or the running total alone) was then displayed for 1000ms. Participants started the task with 10,000 points and could obtain final scores between 51,010 and -31,010. ). The aim of the task was to learn whether to respond or withhold responses to stimuli in order to earn points. Participants learnt by trial and error whether to make or withhold a button press to obtain a reward (points) or avoid punishment (losing points). Eight unfamiliar stimuli were presented individually for 3000ms or until a button press response was made.</p><p>Responses were followed by feedback on the outcome (1000ms) or a running total alone if the participant did not respond. Each stimulus had a fixed value of +/-1, 700, 1400, or 2000 points and was shown once per 'block' for 10 blocks, with a randomised order within blocks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical analysis of behavioural responses</head><p>All statistical analyses were conducted in R (v. 4.1.1 and v. 4.1.2) through RStudio <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42</ref> . Analysis of group differences in participants' behavioural responses was conducted using a nested linear mixed effects model. These analyses were conducted using R's lme4 package glmer function <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43</ref> . Participants' responses were coded as 1 (active response) or 0 (no response) and were predicted from group (TD = 0, CD = 1), age, sex (0 = male, 1 = female), IQ, SES, object repetition number (1-10), and object valence (0 = reward, 1 = punishment) as fixed effects, with varying intercepts allowed for responses grouped by participant nested within site as random effects. All continuous variables were z-scored, and discrete variables (participant response, group, sex) were recoded so that the two levels summed to zero (e.g., 0 and 1 becomes -0.5 and 0.5). To analyse whether group differences in responding across trials were driven by reward or punishment, post-hoc analyses were conducted by repeating the above analysis separately for reward and punishment stimuli. The strength of any null effects was interpreted using Bayes factors calculated with the BIC method <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44</ref> and R's lme4 BIC function <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43</ref> , using standard priors and the language suggested by Jeffreys <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45</ref> .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Model fitting and comparison procedure</head><p>Five different reinforcement learning models were constructed. For each model, rewards were coded as 1, neutral outcomes (when no response was made) as 0, and punishments as -1. Expected values for 'go' and 'no-go' actions were initialised at 0 at the task outset, which is the midpoint between the possible outcomes 1 and -1 and reflects participants' initial lack of knowledge about stimuli values. (An exception to this was for models with an initial action initiation bias; see below). First, we constructed a basic reinforcement learning model, in which learning was captured by a single learning rate (α) parameter and a temperature parameter β, which captures noisiness in responding. In this model, the expected value V of a response on trial t is updated with a reward prediction error PE scaled by the learning rate α, where the prediction error is the discrepancy between the outcome r (1, 0, or -1) and the expected value:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">If go: V(t+1) = V(t) + (α * PE(t)) If no-go: V(t+1) = V(t)</formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">PE(t) = r(t) -V(t) (1): basic model</formula><p>The expected values are then converted to response probabilities using the Softmax equation, where the temperature parameter β adds noise: Probability of observed response = e Vgo(t)/β / (e Vgo(t)/β + e Vnogo(t)/β ) (2): softmax Using the model comparison procedure illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>, we constructed four further models with combinations of additional parameters. These parameters were separate learning rates for reward versus punishment outcomes (3) and two versions of an action initiation bias towards responding regardless of anticipated outcome (4-5). We did not include outcome magnitude sensitivity parameters because in our previous work these parameters did not demonstrate good parameter recovery <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> .</p><p>For reward outcomes: V(t+1) = V(t) + (αr * PE(t))</p><p>For punishment outcomes: V(t+1) = V(t) + (αp * PE(t))</p><p>(3): two learning rates For models that included the initial 'go' bias, the starting value of responding to each object was increased (or decreased) by an amount b_i on the first presentation of the object only:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">V(1) = b_i (4): initial 'go' bias</formula><p>For models that included the constant 'go' bias, the value of responding to each object was increased (or decreased) by an amount b_c on each presentation of the object:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">Vbiased(t) = V(t) + b_c (5): constant 'go' bias</formula><p>Vbiased was used only to calculate the response probability for the current trial, so that the bias did not accumulate over repeated presentations of the object.  <ref type="formula">1</ref>), models with one versus two learning rates (for reward and punishment) were compared, and separately, models with an initial versus constant action initiation bias were compared. A fifth model was then constructed by combining all parameters from the winning models in step 1 (i.e., one versus two learning rates and the winning action initiation bias). In step 2, to confirm that the winning model from step 1 was the best overall model, we compared models 1-5 directly.</p><p>Model fitting and comparison were conducted in MATLAB 2019b <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46</ref> . We used an iterative maximum a posteriori (MAP) approach for all model fitting, in line with previous work using reinforcement learning models <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref> . Models were compared on exceedance probability (where a probability over .95 provides strong evidence for the best fitting model), log model evidence (LME; more positive values indicating better fit <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51</ref> ) and the integrated BIC score (BICint), which penalises more complex models so that a lower BICint indicates better performance. Full details of the model fitting and comparison procedure are provided in Supplementary materials, Model fitting and comparison procedure.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical analysis of model parameters</head><p>Next, we investigated associations between group status (CD versus TD) and model parameters from the winning model. Since parameter values were not normally distributed, we used robust linear mixed effects regression models using the rlmer 43 function in R. We tested whether each parameter was predicted by group status, with age, IQ, SES, and sex as covariates (fixed effects) and varying intercepts for different sites of data collection (random effects). Discrete variables were recoded so that contrasts summed to zero, and continuous variables were z-scored. As above, the strength of null effects was interpreted using Bayes factors calculated with the BIC method <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44</ref> using the language suggested by Jeffreys <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45</ref> .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Associations between model parameters, callous-unemotional and impulsive traits, and CD severity</head><p>Finally, we investigated whether relevant model parameters were associated with selfreported callous-unemotional and impulsive traits in youths with CD, because these traits were theoretically linked to the model parameters that differed between groups (see Results). For punishment learning rates, we tested for associations with the YPI callousness, unemotionality, and remorselessness subscales using three separate robust linear mixed effects regression models. Parameter values were predicted from the relevant YPI subscale (callousness, unemotionality, or remorselessness) and age, sex, and IQ as covariates. Site of data collection was included as a random effect. We corrected for multiple comparisons across the three models using Bonferroni correction. Next, we repeated this procedure to test for an association between action initiation biases and impulsivity using a fourth regression model with the same covariates as above. Where significant associations emerged, we conducted a simple Pearson correlation to check that this was also significant.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Youths with CD made fewer correct responses for punishment but more for reward</head><p>First, we compared overall performance in youths with CD versus TD controls (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>).  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Behavioural evidence for learning from reward and punishment in CD and TD</head><p>There was a significant main effect of stimulus repetition on the number of correct responses made, with performance improving throughout the task (i.e., behavioural evidence for learning; OR = 1.19 [1.16, 1.20], z = 22.81, p &lt; .001). The level of overall learning was similar for the two groups (group by stimulus by repetition interaction: OR = 0.99 [0.96, 1.02], z = -0.67, p = .50, BF01 = 256.00). However, a significant group by valence by repetition interaction suggested that the two groups learned differently from reward versus punishment (OR = 0.78 [0.74, 0.83], z = -8.56, p &lt; .001, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref>). Specifically, separate follow-up models for reward and punishment stimuli revealed that, on a behavioural level, youths with CD seemed to learn more from reward than TD controls (OR = 1.  Finally, we noted that there was a sharp increase in responses on repetition 2 followed by more gradual changes thereafter. To ensure that our results were not driven by this initial pattern alone, we replicated our analyses with stimulus presentations 2-10 only. This did not change our findings (see Supplementary materials, Table <ref type="table">S2</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Computational modelling of reward and punishment learning and action initiation</head><p>We next compared the five computational reinforcement learning models. Models were compared on exceedance probability, Log Model Evidence (LME), and the integrated Bayesian Information Criterion (BICint). Model 5 (2αβb_c) won on all three measures (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5</ref>). Correlations between parameter values and task performance are shown in Supplementary materials, Tables <ref type="table">S3-S4</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Youths with CD had lower punishment learning rates</head><p>We next assessed whether parameter values from the winning model varied in youths with CD versus TD controls. Youths with CD exhibited significantly lower punishment learning rates than TD youths (β = -0.10 [-0.16, -0.03], z = -2.81, p = .01) but, despite making more responses to reward stimuli, did not differ from TD controls on reward learning rates, with Bayesian evidence strongly supporting the null effect (β = 0.09 [-0.01, 0.19], z = 1.67, p = .09, BF10 = 0.002, BF01 = 433.72). Additionally, youths with CD exhibited significantly higher action initiation biases than TD controls (β = 0.35 [0.22, 0.47], z = 5.31, p &lt; .001). There was also a significant difference in temperature parameter between the groups (β = -0.14 [-0.02, 0.06], z = -2.43, p = .02), but we did not attempt to interpret this difference because it was less robust across control analyses (Supplementary materials, Table <ref type="table">S2</ref>) and did not relate to our hypotheses.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>CD and related disorders have often been associated with poor reinforcement learning from punishment <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> and, less consistently, with hypersensitivity to reward <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> . However, none of these studies could distinguish reward learning from impulsively initiating actions. Here, we show using computational modelling that punishment learning rates are reduced in youths with CD. Moreover, while reward learning rates are comparable to TD youths, action initiation biases are heightened in youths with CD. This tendency to impulsively initiate actions was also positively associated with self-reported trait impulsivity. Together, these findings suggest that an apparent hypersensitivity to reward might sometimes reflect an impulsive action initiation bias, rather than enhanced reward learning.</p><p>The finding that punishment has a reduced deterrent effect in CD has been reported previously in smaller samples <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> . Our study adds important evidence in a large international cohort that this is a true learning effect, in line with a recent study that used a probabilistic reinforcement learning task <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> . Interestingly, however, we did not observe an association between punishment learning rates and callous-unemotional traits. On one level, this is surprising, given that callous-unemotional traits are core features of psychopathy and punishment insensitivity has often been considered central to psychopathic traits <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52</ref> . However, empirical evidence has not always supported this association <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53</ref> . Our study provides further evidence that the severity of callous-unemotional traits might not be intrinsically linked to heightened punishment insensitivity, at least within the range of callous-unemotional traits seen in this sample.</p><p>Previous investigations of reward learning in CD have yielded mixed findings <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> with a minority reporting reward hypersensitivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> . These were studies that used a 'risktaking' task in which reward sensitivity was captured by the tendency to pursue rewards despite negative outcomes. In this context, it is unclear whether behaviour is driven by reward sensitivity or punishment insensitivity. Our findings suggest that previous reports of reward hypersensitivity might reflect decreased punishment learning, combined with an impulsive action initiation bias. This interpretation is consistent with previous studies showing no difference in reinforcement learning from reward <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> , and helps to explain why the literature on reward learning appears inconsistent. Additional research into learned versus impulsive responding will be valuable for further elucidating reward-related behaviour in CD.</p><p>Our findings have implications for educational interventions. In particular, while the deterrent effect of punishment is likely to be reduced in CD, the motivating effect of reward is unlikely to be enhanced. While rewards (including praise) are an important element of behaviour management in most schools, evidence for their effectiveness in the general pupil population is quite limited <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54</ref> . The current findings do not suggest that rewards will be more effective for youths with CD than for other youths. Thus, it might be more effective for teachers to focus on reducing impulsivity, for example by helping youths with CD to pre-plan responses to aggravating situations, rather than rely on consequence-based strategies.</p><p>This study has several strengths, including the large, international, clinically wellcharacterised sample and the use of a classic paradigm in CD research <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> . However, we note some limitations. First, due to high levels of comorbidity, we were not able to control for the presence of ADHD. This level of comorbidity does, nonetheless, reflect clinical reality <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> . While this is therefore a shortcoming for theoretical understanding, the practical implications of our findings would likely stand regardless of the role of ADHD. Second, our task design did not allow us to distinguish between inhibiting actions to avoid punishment and inhibiting actions to gain reward, nor between making responses to gain reward and making responses to avoid punishment <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> . This would have allowed a more nuanced understanding of how action biases interact with outcome valence. Finally, it should be noted that modelling parameters are always a reflection of the task as well as participant characteristics <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">55</ref> , and modelling parameters should be subject to the same scrutiny and independent replication as any other psychological measurement.</p><p>In summary, we demonstrated that youths with CD exhibited lower punishment learning rates, higher action initiation biases, and similar reward learning rates to TD youths. This is one of the first studies to apply computational modelling techniques to studying CD. Our findings suggest that impulsive behaviour is an important element of apparently reward-oriented behaviour in CD, and that practitioners should be aware of this alongside more widely recognised difficulties in punishment learning.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
