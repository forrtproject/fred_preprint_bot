<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>BEYOND THE MYTH OF SLIMMING 3</head><p>In recent years, Chinese social networking platforms have seen numerous discussions on body aesthetics, featuring physical aesthetic challenges like the "A4 waist" (comparing the waist's width to an A4 sheet of paper) and the "coins on collarbones" (placing as many coins as possible in the hollow of one's collarbone to highlight thinness). Additionally, there has been widespread sharing of weight loss methods such as the "21-day weight loss method" (a structured diet plan for 21 days) and "5-day light fasting" (a modified form of intermittent fasting over five days). "Only thinness is the ideal body shape" has gradually become an obsession for many people across both Eastern and Western cultures <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Swami, 2015)</ref>. This obsession affects not only women but also men, who also experience body dissatisfaction and eating disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Striegel-Moore et al., 2009)</ref>. Song and his colleagues (2012) conducted a survey of 2,599 college students in 15 universities in 10 provinces and cities in China and found that 34.6% of women and 12.1% of men were underweight. The sharp contrast between the ideal of becoming thinner and the reality of not achieving such thinness diminishes positive body evaluation. More critically, it leads to adverse physical and mental health effects, including eating disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Thompson &amp; Stice, 2001)</ref>, low self-esteem <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Johnson &amp; Wardle, 2005)</ref>, and depression <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Brechan &amp; Kvalem, 2015)</ref>. Therefore, it is important to address how to change the pursuit of the "thin ideal" among young people to enhance positive body image and reduce unhealthy weight loss behaviors.</p><p>The present study posits that under the influence of social and cultural factors (such as family, peers, and media), individuals may overestimate the acceptance of "thin ideal" attitudes (injunctive social norms) and behaviors (descriptive social norms). This can lead to increasingly stringent "thin ideal" standards, thereby widening the gap between the ideal self and the real self in terms of body image. This discrepancy can harm an individual's positive body image. Therefore, it is crucial to adopt effective social norm interventions to enhance the positive perception of body image among normal-weight youth and reduce unhealthy weight loss behaviors (such as insufficient calorie intake). Correcting misperceptions is the most widely used social norm intervention method. Combining this with the role model strategy of promoting positive norms can enhance the effectiveness of social norm interventions. In summary, we explored the impact of "thin ideal" social norms on individuals' positive body image and the mediating role of body image self-discrepancy. Additionally, we further examined the effects of various social norm BEYOND THE MYTH OF SLIMMING 4 interventions on individuals' positive body image and calorie intake.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>"Thin Ideal" Social Norms and Positive Body Image</head><p>Social norms, recognized and followed by the majority of people in a social group, differ from the mandatory behavioral regulations imposed by laws and statutes <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Cialdini &amp; Trost, 1998)</ref>.</p><p>Social norms are commonly categorized into descriptive norms, which refer to individuals' perceptions of others' behaviors (what is done), and injunctive norms, which refer to individuals' perceptions of others' attitudes (what ought to be done) <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Cialdini &amp; Trost, 1998)</ref>. When most people in a social group accept and adhere to the belief that "a thin body is the ideal body," the social norm of the "thin ideal" is established <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Thompson &amp; Stice, 2001)</ref>. The descriptive norm is "everyone is striving to become thinner," and the injunctive norm is "everyone believes people should become thinner." Social norms influence attitudes and behaviors through two main mechanisms: making effective decisions and maintaining social approval <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Jacobson et al., 2011)</ref>. When the "thin ideal" becomes a social norm, individuals may perceive weight loss behaviors as a "wise approach". The desire for conformity and social recognition can lead individuals to adhere to these norms to avoid feelings of guilt or not belonging to the group <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Wenzel, 2005)</ref>. Consequently, the "thin ideal" can shape individuals' perceptions of their body image <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Slade, 1994)</ref>. Body image comprises three aspects: perception (accuracy of body shape judgment), attitude (body satisfaction, attention, and cognitive evaluation), and behavior (situational avoidance behavior due to body appearance concerns) <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Raich et al., 1995)</ref>. Most studies focus on the attitude aspect, particularly body satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Grogan, 2006)</ref>. Positive body image differs from negative body image in that it involves not only reducing negative body perceptions but also fostering a positive attitude of love and respect for one's body, accepting aspects that diverge from the "thin ideal" <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Tylka, 2011)</ref>. Thus, positive body image transcends pathology and encompasses richer characteristics, even covering the body image perception of those with non-clinical disorders. While previous research has primarily focused on the body image of young women <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Tiggemann, 2004)</ref>, some large-scale studies have also found that many men experience low body satisfaction (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Austin et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Frederick et al., 2007)</ref>. Both men and women have a desire for muscle and thinness <ref type="bibr">(Kelley et al.,</ref> BEYOND THE MYTH OF SLIMMING 5 2010). And low body fat percentage is also a key component of the ideal male body <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Cafri et al., 2005)</ref>. Therefore, this study examines body image issues arising from the desire for thinness in both women and men.</p><p>Sociocultural factors significantly impact body image, with family, peers, and particularly the media playing crucial roles <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Thompson et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Tiggemann, 2011)</ref>. As social media becomes widely used by young people, its connection to body image has gained increasing importance. For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Kim and Chock (2015)</ref> found that online behaviors like "social dressing" are positively correlated with a tendency towards thinness and appearance comparison. During the transition from adolescence to adulthood (18-35 years old), social anxiety is closely related to body image concerns <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Luqman &amp; Dixit, 2017)</ref>. Influenced by personalized social media recommendations, individuals may overestimate the prevalence of the "thin ideal" and internalize thinness as the standard of an ideal body shape. When individuals internalize this standard and believe they have not achieved it, their body satisfaction decreases <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Heinberg &amp; Thompson, 1995)</ref>, which harms their positive body image. This dissatisfaction can lead to unhealthy weight loss behaviors, such as consuming too few calories, to attain the ideal body shape <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Thompson &amp; Stice, 2001)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Self-discrepancy in Body Image</head><p>Self-discrepancy theory proposes a three-part self: the actual self (one's current self-image), the ideal self (desired self-image), and the ought self (self-image based on perceived obligations) <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Higgins, 1987)</ref>. Self-discrepancy refers to the inconsistency between the actual self and the ideal or ought self <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Higgins, 1987)</ref>. In China, the ideal self and the ought self overlap significantly <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Guo, 1996)</ref>, so the present study did not distinguish between the two. Body image self-discrepancy is the difference between actual and ideal body images. The present study focuses on body satisfaction as an attitude <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Grogan, 2006)</ref>, and the difference between actual and ideal weight has been validated as a measure of body dissatisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Williamson et al., 1993)</ref>. Therefore, the Body Mass Index (BMI), which accurately reflects health and fatness, was used for evaluation. A lower BMI indicates a lighter individual at the same height. Thus, body image self-discrepancy is operationalized as the difference between an individual's actual BMI and ideal BMI.</p><p>When individuals accept the social norm of the "thin ideal", they view thinness as the ideal body shape. This belief forms an ideal self of body image and establishes an ideal BMI. However, an individual's actual BMI does not change rapidly, creating a discrepancy between the ideal BMI and the actual BMI, thereby reducing positive body image. In summary, we proposed that the impact of the "thin ideal" social norm on body image is to increase the gap between the individual's actual body shape and ideal body shape. This discrepancy leads individuals to feel dissatisfied with their body shape.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Social Norm Interventions</head><p>Damage to positive body image can lead to unhealthy eating disorders, such as overeating, dieting, and vomiting <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Thompson &amp; Stice, 2001)</ref>. Reducing calorie intake is a common method, typically involving low-calorie foods or intermittent fasting <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Polivy et al., 2020)</ref>. However, long-term insufficient calorie intake lowers the body's metabolic rate and increases appetite, potentially triggering binge eating and rapid weight gain, thus creating a vicious cycle of unhealthy eating <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Benton &amp; Young, 2017)</ref>. Individuals with a positive body image are more resistant to negative information presented in social media <ref type="bibr">(Andrew et al., 2015)</ref>, and tend to engage in fewer unhealthy eating behaviors <ref type="bibr">(Andrew et al., 2016)</ref>. To improve positive body image and reduce unhealthy weight loss behaviors (i.e., help increase calorie intake), social norm theory can be applied to develop and test intervention strategies. Unlike clinical interventions, social norm interventions can provide concise information and achieve short-term effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Stok et al., 2014)</ref>. One effective form of social norm intervention is personalized normative feedback (PNF), which provides individuals with personalized information about themselves and their peers. This form offers credible, specific data and sources, ensuring that participants engage with the intervention information <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Miller &amp; Prentice, 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Social norm intervention is based on the premise that people are often unaware of their misperceptions about norms. Therefore, the primary component of social norm intervention is correcting misperceptions <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Miller &amp; Prentice, 2016)</ref>. Misperceptions can lead individuals to mistakenly believe that certain attitudes or behaviors are common in their group, resulting in dangerous behaviors such as alcoholism and substance abuse <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Dempsey et al., 2018)</ref>. Correcting these misperceptions involves informing individuals that their peers generally agree with a certain concept or behavior (injunctive social norms) or perform a certain behavior (descriptive social norms), thereby changing their erroneous perceptions and behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Miller &amp; Prentice, 2016)</ref>. This intervention has been effective in reducing alcoholism <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Neighbors et al., 2010)</ref>, promoting energy-saving and environmental protection behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Goldstein et al., 2008)</ref>, and encouraging tax compliance <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Wenzel, 2005)</ref>. Similarly, the formation of the "thin ideal" cognition may follow this process. In social media environments with personalized information feeds, individuals exposed to "thin ideal" content may overestimate its prevalence, leading to misperceptions that need to be corrected.</p><p>Correcting misperception is an effective method, but <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Legros and Cislaghi (2020)</ref> suggest that combining this approach with other factors, such as strategies to increase positive norms, can enhance the effectiveness of social norm interventions. They propose that role models (e.g., social influencers, exemplary peers, and opinion leaders) can exert significant social influence due to personal connections, group-granted authority, and identity recognition. During social learning, individuals often imitate successful role models, including aspects not directly related to their success, such as imitating the clothing choices of sports stars <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Mesoudi, 2009)</ref>. Role models are crucial in motivational processes as they point out specific goals, provide inspiration and hope, and help individuals achieve self-improvement <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Lockwood &amp; Kunda, 1997)</ref>. Peer role models, in particular, can change unhealthy behaviors such as drinking and substance abuse among adolescents <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Perkins &amp; Craig, 2002)</ref> and significantly impact adolescents' appearance expectations and body image <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Carey et al., 2014)</ref>. In the context of the "thin ideal" social norm, correcting misperceptions involves addressing misconceptions about "thin ideal" attitudes and behaviors, focusing on correcting errors; while role models encourage individuals to abandon the "thin ideal" and reduce unhealthy weight loss behaviors, focusing on setting positive goals. Combining these methods means correcting misconceptions first and then setting positive goals, reflecting a more comprehensive intervention approach.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Overview of the Present Study</head><p>The present research examined the impact of "thin ideal" social norms on individuals' positive body image and calorie intake. We hypothesized that the perception of "thin ideal" social BEYOND THE MYTH OF SLIMMING 8 norms negatively predicts positive body image (H1), meaning that the stronger the individual's perceived "thin ideal" social norms, the lower their positive body image level. BMI self-discrepancy mediates the relationship between the perception of "thin ideal" social norms and positive body image, indicating that stronger perceptions of "thin ideal" social norms increase BMI self-discrepancy, thereby reducing the level of positive body image (H2). To enhance positive body image and reduce unhealthy weight loss behaviors, we leverage social norms as an intervention. We proposed that interventions aimed at correcting misperceptions of the "thin ideal" social norm can significantly improve individuals' positive body image (H3a) and increase calorie intake (H3b). Finally, compared to merely correcting misperceptions, an intervention combining the correction of misperceptions with peer role models is more effective in improving positive body image (H4a) and increasing calorie intake (H4b).</p><p>Four sub-studies were conducted to verify these hypotheses. Study 1 preliminarily tested the mediating role of self-discrepancy in the relationship between "thin ideal" social norms and positive body image through a questionnaire survey. The subsequent studies focused on solving practical problems through intervention: Study 2 explored whether social norm-based misconception correction interventions could improve positive body image and increase calorie intake. Study 3 compared the effects of misconception correction with a combination of misconception correction and the role model. Study 4 extended the duration of the intervention to examine whether its effects were lasting based on the effectiveness of the intervention method.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>The required sample size was calculated using G*Power 3.1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Faul et al., 2009)</ref>, assuming a medium explanatory power R 2 = 0.13 <ref type="bibr">(Cohen, 1977, p. 413)</ref>, with statistical power 1 -β = 0.8 and a significance level α = 0.05. At least 68 participants were needed to run the multiple regression model. We distributed questionnaires to college students on the Wenjuanxing platform (a questionnaire platform in China), recruiting a total of 269 participants. After excluding 58 participants who did not complete the survey attentively (e.g., the survey completion time was less than 30 seconds or they failed the attention check question), we had 211 valid responses. The final sample consisted of 113 females and 98 males, aged between 18 and 27 years old (M = 22.31, SD = 2.10). The average BMI for females was 21.53 ± 3.45 kg/m², and for males, it was 22.56 ± 2.93 kg/m².</p></div>

(2018)</ref>, the scale comprised six items across two dimensions: descriptive social norms (e.g., "Many people in society now are losing weight, exercising, or taking other actions to achieve thinness") and injunctive social norms (e.g., "Many people in society now think that thin bodies are more beautiful"), corresponding to the three dimensions proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Thompson et al. (1999)</ref>: family, peers, and media. A 7-point Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree, 7 = strongly agree) was used, with higher scores indicating a higher level of perceived "thin ideal" social norms.</p><p>Confirmatory factor analysis results showed that after deleting the item "Many of my relatives now think that thin bodies are more beautiful" from the injunctive social norms dimension, the fit index of the 2-factor model was relatively ideal (χ 2 (4) = 9.874, CFI = 0.979, TLI = 0.948, RMSEA = 0.08). The reliability of the descriptive social norms subscale was 0.776, the reliability of the injunctive social norms subscale was 0.711, and the reliability of the total scale was 0.708.

Principal component analysis was employed without rotating the results. The common method bias results indicated that three factors with eigenvalues greater than 1 were extracted, with the first factor explaining 39.76% of the variance, which is below the critical threshold of 40%, suggesting no serious common method bias <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Podsakoff et al., 2003)</ref>.</p><p>Descriptive statistics and correlation analysis are presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>The results of Study 1 supported H1 and H2. Both the descriptive and injunctive social norms of the "thin ideal" negatively predicted positive body image, indicating that the stronger the perceived social norm of the "thin ideal" corresponds to lower levels of positive body image. BMI self-discrepancy partially mediated the relationship between these social norms and positive body image, meaning that the perceived social norms of the "thin ideal" reduced positive body image by increasing BMI self-discrepancy. Consistent with previous evidence, internalization of the "thin ideal" social norm causes individuals to continually compare their real body shape with their ideal body shape. The greater the discrepancy between the two, the lower their body satisfaction and the more negative their body image <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Furnham et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Harrison, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Vartanian, 2012</ref>).</p><p>An interesting additional finding was that the independent sample t-test showed no significant difference in positive body image between participants of different genders (t(209) = 0.9, p = 0.37), which contradicts previous studies suggesting that men generally have higher positive body image than women <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Tylka, 2011)</ref>. In addition, while gender was not significantly correlated with descriptive social norms, it was significantly negatively correlated with injunctive social norms (r = -0.21, p = 0.002), indicating that women perceive higher injunctive social norms.</p><p>This suggests that women feel more pressure from the "thin ideal" social norms, likely because the media often presents "ideal" female images emphasizing thinness <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Holland &amp; Tiggemann, 2016)</ref>, which may be more impactful than behavioral norms.</p></div>

Since the online environment aligns well with how individuals receive social media information, and the effectiveness of online interventions has been confirmed by previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Buckner et al., 2019)</ref>, Study 2 utilized an online experiment.</p></div>

The results showed that the main effects of time (p = 0.65) and social norm intervention (p = 0.62)</p><p>were not significant. However, the interaction between time and social norm was significant, F(3, 112) = 5.96, p = 0.001, η 2 p = 0.13. Simple effects tests (see Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>) showed that the caloric intake of the "thin ideal" social norm intervention group on day 2 (M = 1493.47, SD = 55.65 p = 0.005), and day 3 (M = 1510.96, SD = 47.57, p = 0.001) was significantly higher than on day 1 (M = 1302.06, SD = 56.13). However, the difference between day 4 and day 1 did not reach significance (p = 0.53). The difference in caloric intake of the control group over the four days was not significant (p t2 = 0.58, p t3 = 0.58, p t2 = 1.00).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Study 2 partly verified H3. In terms of positive body image, compared with the control group, no positive effect of the "thin ideal" social norm intervention was observed, and H3a was not verified. In terms of calorie intake, the calorie intake of the "thin ideal" social norm intervention group on the second and third days was significantly higher than the baseline level, while the BEYOND THE MYTH OF SLIMMING 18 control group did not show such an increase trend, which showed a positive effect of social norm intervention on calorie intake, verifying H3b.</p><p>The current injunctive social norm intervention significantly increased calorie intake but failed to find a significant increase in the level of positive body image. Moreover, from the trend of calorie intake changes, it only increased significantly on the second day, slowed down on the third day, and even began to decline on the fourth day, returning to the level before the intervention. This can be improved from two points: First, the manipulation test results showed that the manipulation of the descriptive part did not reach a significant level, possibly because it was not clearly reflected in the manipulation materials. Additionally, descriptive and injunctive social norms play intertwined roles. Descriptive norms provide information for making accurate and effective choices, while injunctive norms are related to the interpersonal goals of establishing and maintaining social relationships. Therefore, it is crucial to distinguish between these two types of information <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Jacobson et al., 2011)</ref>. Although both descriptive and injunctive social norms can successfully change attitudes and behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Miller &amp; Prentice, 2016)</ref>, descriptive social norms can offer more advantages in information processing during behavioral decision-making. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Stok et al. (2014)</ref> found that descriptive norms had a lasting impact on fruit intake behavior, while injunctive norms showed a certain resistance effect in the short term. Based on previous studies and the results of Study 2, this study chose to continue exploring the intervention effect of descriptive social norms in correcting misperceptions. Secondly, this may also indicate that the traditional intervention method of correcting misperceptions is limited in effect, and more effective intervention methods need to be further explored. Therefore, Study 3 introduced the role model factor, combining correcting misperceptions with role model interventions to address the "thin ideal" social norms. The study compared the effectiveness of this combined approach with the traditional method of correcting misperceptions.</p></div>

In terms of positive body image, the interventions in the misperception correction group and the correction-role model group were not significantly better than those in the control group, so H4a was not verified. This may be because the participants, who exhibited restrictive eating behaviors, placed more importance on body image than the general population, making it more difficult to change their views on body image. In terms of calorie intake, compared with the control group, both social norm interventions significantly increased calorie intake, and the calorie intake in the correction-role model intervention was significantly higher than that in the simple correction of misperceptions intervention, verifying H4b. Specifically, the correction of misperceptions intervention showed an overall downward trend after T2 and the difference in calorie intake at T5 compared to the control group did not reach a significant level. In contrast, the correction-role model group had significantly higher calorie intake than the control group at T2, T3, T4, and T5, indicating that the combined intervention of correction and role models lasted longer than the simple correction of misperceptions intervention.</p><p>An unexpected finding was that compared to Study 3, which involved the general population, Study 4, which targeted the restricted eating group, had a better intervention effect on caloric intake behavior. Specifically, the effect size (η 2 p = 0.066) was higher than that of Study 3 (η 2 p = 0.058). This may be because restrictive eaters are more focused on body image and more sensitive to diet-related intervention information. Therefore, once the intervention measures take effect, they exhibit a more noticeable improvement in calorie intake behavior compared to the general population.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Discussion</head><p>Across four studies, we explored the mechanism of the impact of the "thin ideal" social norm on the positive body image of young people and, on this basis, examined the effects of different Although no significant effect of social norm intervention on positive body image was found, the results for caloric intake indicated that the combined intervention of correcting misperceptions and role modeling had a longer-lasting effect on caloric intake in the youth group compared to the intervention method of correcting misperceptions alone.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theoretical Implications</head><p>The current research introduces the social norm perspective into the field of body image, expanding the research on its influencing mechanisms. Many previous studies, based on the sociocultural perspective <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Thompson et al., 1999)</ref>, emphasize the role of "thin ideal internalization" in leading to negative body image and eating disorders (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Fitzsimmons-Craft et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Myers &amp; Crowther, 2007)</ref>. The present research takes a different approach, combining social norms theory with self-discrepancy theory to explain how the perception of the "thin ideal" social norm affects an individual's positive body image. While the sociocultural perspective and the social norms perspective share similarities, including factors like family, peers, and media, social norms theory posits that individuals have "misperceptions" about body evaluation and achieving ideal standards. In the context of social media and algorithm-driven content dissemination <ref type="bibr">(Acerbi, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Kim &amp; Chock, 2015)</ref>, the "thin ideal" social norms are more widely spread, causing individuals to overestimate the prevalence (descriptive social norms) and acceptability (injunctive social norms) of the "thin ideal," thereby deepening its internalization <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Harrison, 2001)</ref>. These theoretical shifts help us better understand body image influences and offer practical intervention strategies to reduce "thin ideal" perceptions.</p><p>Secondly, the present work verifies the intervention effect of social norms in the realm of body image. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bergstrom and Neighbors (2006)</ref> identified three types of body image interventions:</p><p>(1) media literacy education to recognize unrealistic ideal body shapes, ( Finally, the present findings propose a more effective intervention method by combining correcting misperceptions with role models, compared to the single application of correcting misperceptions. There is often a gap between perceived and actual social norms <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Chung &amp; Rimal, 2016)</ref>, and traditional interventions aim to correct these misperceptions to change behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Miller &amp; Prentice, 2016)</ref>. The present study confirms that combining correction with role models is more effective in improving positive body image and calorie intake. Role models enhance the intervention effect by promoting norm diffusion and encouraging behavior imitation within groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Legros &amp; Cislaghi, 2020)</ref>. While correcting misperceptions focuses on addressing mistakes, role models set positive goals, providing a logically coherent and deeper intervention method.</p><p>Additionally, in the field of body image, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Carey et al. (2014)</ref> found that role models may put great pressure on adolescents in terms of appearance expectations and have a strong negative impact on their body image. The present findings show that we can also leverage the power of role models to positively impact body image.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Practical Implications</head><p>This paper confirms the mechanism by which the "thin ideal" social norm influences body image and proposes a more effective intervention that combines correcting misperceptions with role models. This approach offers practical intervention strategies for normal-BMI individuals with negative body images or unhealthy weight loss behaviors. Role models significantly enhance the effect of social norm interventions beyond traditional misperception correction methods.</p><p>Recognized role models, such as outstanding students and social media influencers, should be aware that their behavior sets an example for others. They should promote diverse body image standards rather than a singular "thin ideal," encouraging a positive body image within their communities.</p><p>Additionally, the present research provides some suggestions for commercial organizations in the health field. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations and Future Work</head><p>Several limitations should be considered when interpreting the results. First, the longest intervention period in the current study, so it remains uncertain whether the observed changes in positive body image and calorie intake would persist over a longer duration. Additionally, although the social norm intervention had a significant effect on the calorie intake of the restrictive eating group, its impact on improving their positive body image needs further investigation. Future studies can more precisely limit the participants to individuals with low positive body image and restrictive eating behaviors, examining specific behaviors rather than just tendencies.</p><p>Second, the present study focused on normal-BMI youth without addressing whether the "thin ideal" social norm intervention might negatively affect overweight youth. Some researchers express concern that attempts to improve body image by reducing "thin ideal" perceptions might inadvertently increase the likelihood of being overweight <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Stice &amp; Shaw, 2004)</ref>. Third, this study did not directly compare the intervention effects of descriptive and injunctive social norms. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Miller and Prentice (2016)</ref> believed that the implicit association between descriptive and injunctive social norms between these norms can successfully change attitudes and behaviors. However, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Göckeritz et al. (2010)</ref> suggest that these norms can sometimes be "misaligned" in their effects. Specifically, people may believe that individuals perform certain behaviors out of fear of negative consequences, not necessarily because they approve of the behavior, or that others may approve of the behavior but will not act on it. Future research can further explore the consistency and difference between these two types of social norm interventions.</p><p>Additionally, for restrictive eaters (Study 4), the social norm intervention did not significantly improve positive body image but did have a substantial effect on caloric intake, even surpassing the effect size of Study 3, which targeted the general population. This finding raises interesting questions: Is social norm intervention more effective at changing caloric intake (a behavioral indicator) than positive body image (an attitudinal indicator) for restrictive eaters? One hypothesis is that restrictive eaters place greater importance on body image than the general group.</p><p>The "thin ideal" social norm intervention may lead to dual cognitive conflicts. On the one hand, it concerns body image, transitioning from the belief that "only thinness is beautiful" before the intervention to "thinness is not the only standard of beauty" during the intervention. On the other hand, it involves eating behavior, shifting from "others don't eat much, only I eat a lot" before the intervention to "others may eat more than me" during the intervention. Restrictive eaters attach more importance to body image than normal eaters, so they are more sensitive to information about diet, and the intervention has a greater impact on caloric intake. Changing body image, however, is more challenging because it is closely tied to self-concept. Furthermore, we speculate that groups placing more importance on body image, such as restrictive eaters, will more strictly control their calorie intake based on their body image. This suggests a stronger relationship between body image and calorie intake in these groups. Therefore, if their body image perception changes and they no longer use thinness as a primary criterion for self-evaluation, their eating behavior may also change more significantly. Future research can test this theoretical reasoning by examining the degree of attention given to body image.</p><p>Finally, the original intention of the present study was to explore the common desire for weight loss between both sexes, so gender differences were not specifically considered. However, gender is an important factor in the field of body image. In Study 1, the difference in positive body image between genders did not reach a significant level. In Study 2~4, there were too few male participants to make statistically feasible comparisons between the sexes. However, the disparity in the proportion of male and female participants in the study recruitment just shows that women may attach more importance to body image than men. Therefore, future research can continue to explore the different levels of importance and different connotations given to body image by both sexes based on the present study. For example, women may prefer thinness, while men may prefer muscularity. On this basis, future studies can develop social norm interventions that consider gender differences.</p></div>

Study 1 verified the mediating role of BMI self-discrepancy in the relationship between the "thin ideal" social norm and positive body image. Specifically, the stronger the perceived descriptive or injunctive social norms of the "thin ideal", the greater the BMI self-discrepancy and the lower the level of positive body image perception. Building on this, Studies 2-4 further explored the effects of interventions targeting the "thin ideal" social norm. Study 2 showed that injunctive social norms can significantly increase caloric intake but did not significantly improve positive body image.Therefore, Study 3 focused on descriptive social norms, which were relatively more effective. The results indicated that both the intervention methods of correcting misperceptions and combining BEYOND THE MYTH OF SLIMMING 29 correction with role modeling improved positive body image and caloric intake, with the combined intervention being more effective. Study 4 limited the participants to individuals with normal BMI and restrictive eating behavior, extending the intervention period to 10 days.</figDesc></figure>
