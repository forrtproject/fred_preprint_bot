<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Self-control is essential for managing actions, yet its exertion is perceived as effortful.</p><p>Performing a task may require effort not only because of its inherent difficulty but also due to its potential for inducing boredom, as boredom has been shown to be self-control demanding itself. So far, the extent of self-control demands during boredom and its temporal dynamics remain elusive. We employed a multimethod approach to address this knowledge gap.</p><p>Ninety-five participants took part in an easy and hard version of the Stroop task. During both tasks, they indicated several times their sensation of task difficulty, boredom, boredomrelated effort, difficulty-related effort, overall effort, and fatigue. We tested if pupil size, as a physiological indicator of cognitive effort, was predicted more accurately by difficulty-and boredom-related effort together than by task-difficulty-related effort alone. The best model fit included boredom-, difficulty-related effort, and their interactions with task type (easy, hard Stroop). Tonic pupil size increased during the easy Stroop, while phasic pupil size decreased with greater boredom-related effort in both tasks. Greater difficulty-related effort was linked to increases in tonic and phasic pupil size in the easy, but not in the hard Stroop. Finally, boredom-related effort in the Stroop predicted performance in a subsequent flanker task. Our results provide preliminary support that enduring boredom may not only be perceived as effortful but also be reflected in psychophysiological changes. Moreover, it may influence subsequent behavior. This underscores the importance of considering boredom as a potential confound in self-control research and broader study designs.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Public Significance Statement</head><p>This study seeks to uncover the relationship between boredom and cognitive effort during task completion. To disentangle the dynamic interplay between boredom and cognitive effort during both easy and difficult tasks, we employed a combination of objective measures (pupil size) and subjective measures (self-reports). Understanding how boredom influences cognitive effort required during the fulfillment of different self-control demanding tasks sheds light on a crucial aspect of human behavior, specifically how enduring boredom impacts cognitive effort during task completion. Our findings carry important implications for society and well-being, as they offer insights into strategies for enhancing task performance and maintaining motivation in various areas of life.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Registered Report: How Effortful is Boredom? Studying Self-Control Demands Through Pupillometry</head><p>To effectively navigate everyday life, people have to control their behavior on a regular basis <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Hofmann et al., 2012)</ref>. For example, in order to make progress towards the goal of alleviating their back pain, a person has to control the impulse to linger on their couch and has to engage in repeated stretching and muscle strengthening exercises instead. This example illustrates that self-control is essential for reaching our goals. Indeed, self-control is understood to be a fundamental aspect of human functioning <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Ainslie, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Bieleke &amp; Wolff, 2021b)</ref> helping us to overcome impulses that offer short-term gratification but are not in line with our long-term goals <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Hofmann et al., 2009)</ref>. Better self-control is linked to a wide range of positive outcomes, such as success, health, and happiness <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Hofmann et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Moffitt et al., 2011)</ref>. As self-control is defined as the "efforts people exert to stimulate desirable responses and inhibit undesirable responses" <ref type="bibr">(de Ridder et al., 2012, p. 77)</ref>, selfcontrol is by definition linked to effort. Notably, self-control is also influenced by motivational aspects which would not only facilitate the regulation of behavior towards ones goals, but also reduce the sensation of effort <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">(Wennerhold &amp; Friese, 2023)</ref> and consequently its costs.</p><p>Cognitive effort, which can be defined as "intensity of mental <ref type="bibr">[…]</ref> work that organisms apply towards some outcome" <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Inzlicht et al., 2018)</ref>, can be measured objectively (e.g., with pupillometry) or experienced subjectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Bijleveld, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Robinson &amp; Morsella, 2014)</ref>, which we will refer to as perceived effort<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">foot_0</ref> . A large body of research shows that the objective and the perceived investment of effort tends to feel unpleasant and aversive <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(David et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Kool &amp; Botvinick, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Wolff et al., 2021)</ref>. On the other hand, effort is considered to feel unpleasant due to the costs of continuing with the ongoing activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Kurzban, 2016)</ref>. Thus, while effort is instrumental for effective self-control, it appears to carry a momentary cost, and the prolonged exertion of effort creates cumulative costs, such as fatigue or tiredness <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Ainslie, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Hopstaken et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Kurzban, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Kurzban et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Westbrook et al., 2013)</ref>. In addition to efforts' intrinsic costs <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Kool et al., 2013)</ref>, mobilizing effort towards one goal creates opportunity costs: When we direct our effort towards one activity (e.g., exercising to tackle backpain), we have to forego other, potentially more rewarding activities (e.g., going for a walk with friends). In this case, the aversive sensation of effort is considered to index the costs of continuing with the ongoing activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Kurzban, 2016)</ref>. This can create added self-control demands that make pursuing one's goal and continuing with a task even more self-control demanding and by extension more effortful <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Kurzban et al., 2013)</ref>. In light of effort's costs (intrinsic and/or opportunity costs), people are selective about when to invest effort in the service of self-control and the sensation of effort has been conceived as an index for the momentary costs of self-control <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Bieleke et al., 2023)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Momentary Self-Control Costs and Performance in Self-Control Demanding Tasks</head><p>The idea of selectively investing effort is consistent with influential theories like the motivational intensity theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Brehm &amp; Self, 1989)</ref>, which states that individuals do only decide to invest effort into a task of known difficulty if the required amount of effort can be justified by the individuals' importance of success. Other theories like ego depletion or mental fatigue theories posit that prior engagement in demanding tasks or the exertion of selfcontrol can result in impaired performance on subsequent tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Baumeister et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Kurzban et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Marcora et al., 2009)</ref>. To test this, a plethora of studies has investigated the effects exerting self-control has on accumulated self-control costs (e.g., exertion, fatigue, tiredness; <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Wolff et al., 2021)</ref> as well as on performance in subsequent self-control demanding tasks (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Dang, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Giboin &amp; Wolff, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Hagger et al., 2010)</ref>. This has most frequently been studied with a sequential task design <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Dang et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Englert &amp; Bertrams, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Solomon et al., 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Vassena et al., 2014)</ref>. Here, participants are asked to complete either a more difficult or less difficult version of a task before performance on a secondary task is measured. While a large body of research has found that prior self-control exertion has detrimental effects on performance in subsequent self-control demanding tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Giboin &amp; Wolff, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Hagger et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Hagger et al., 2010)</ref>, high-powered pre-registered replication failures and evidence for a large amount of grey literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">(Wolff et al., 2018)</ref>, as well as for publication bias has called the evidential value of this proposition into question <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Carter &amp; McCullough, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Holgado &amp; Mesquida, 2023)</ref>. One potential reason for these mixed findings might be that the hard and easy tasks that are typically used in sequential task design studies, differ not only with respect to their structural self-control demands caused by task difficulty, but on other properties too. One such difference could be that easy variants might not only be less challenging but also more boring <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">(Wolff &amp; Martarelli, 2020)</ref>. Take, for instance, the Stroop task <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Stroop, 1935)</ref>, which is frequently used in self-control research <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Dang, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Wolff et al., 2018)</ref>. Here, participants are asked to categorize a stream of color words (e.g., red, blue) according to the font color they are presented in. In the easy version, the font color and the semantic meaning of the word are the same (i.e., congruent). In contrast, font color and semantic meaning differ (i.e., incongruent) in the hard version <ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">2</ref> .</p><p>Consistent with the hypothesis that hard and easy Stroop versions might differ not only with respect to their structural self-control demands caused by task difficulty, participants tend to find the easy version of the Stroop to be more boring <ref type="bibr">(Bieleke et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Hunte et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Mangin et al., 2021)</ref>. This difference matters because continuing to work on a boring task is understood to be self-control demanding in its own right <ref type="bibr">(Bieleke &amp; Wolff, 2021a)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>How Could Boredom Act as a Self-Control Demand?</head><p>Boredom occurs when one's resources feel not adequately utilized <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">(Wolff et al., 2024)</ref>. Put simply, we get bored when we feel we are wasting our time. Consistent with this conceptualization, boredom tends to occur when tasks are too easy (or too hard; <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Westgate &amp; Wilson, 2018)</ref>, feel meaningless <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">(van Tilburg &amp; Igou, 2017)</ref>, and/or when a person feels they have no agency <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Danckert &amp; Eastwood, 2020)</ref>. Crucially, boredom is consequential because it is understood to signal that one should do something else <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bench &amp; Lench, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Elpidorou, 2014)</ref>. With respect to the mechanisms by which boredom operates, research shows that boredom leads to a devaluation of the current activity, and increased reward sensitivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Milyavskaya et al., 2019)</ref>, thereby prompting exploration behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Agrawal et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Bench &amp; Lench, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Danckert, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Geana et al., 2016)</ref>. By biasing behavior towards alternative activities, boredom increases the opportunity costs of sticking with what one is currently doing, thereby increasing the self-control demands <ref type="bibr">(Bieleke &amp; Wolff, 2021a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Bieleke et al., 2023)</ref> and the perceived effort <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Eastwood et al., 2012)</ref> needed to keep engaged with the boring task. Take for example a lengthy zoom call. During such a meeting, many readers have probably experienced moments of boredom and have felt the urge to look at their phone and browse social media. Not giving in to this boredom-induced urge has likely made it harder to stay focused on what is discussed in the call. Consequently, self-control and effort are not only required for performing challenging activities, but also for underchallenging ones, making boredom a possible confound in self-control research but also in other research fields <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Meier et al., 2023)</ref> that has been largely overlooked for so far <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">(Wolff &amp; Martarelli, 2020)</ref>.</p><p>The Stroop task can provide an intuitive example of this. At the very beginning of the task, a period to become accustomed to it is required. During this phase, participants need to familiarize themselves with several key aspects, such as the colors presented, the location of the corresponding keys, and the task instructions. These additional challenges can result in a higher task difficulty, potentially leading to a greater demand for cognitive effort to successfully complete the task. In addition, the task would still feel novel, thereby likely being less boring for the participant. However, as the task progresses, participants become increasingly familiar with its demands. They encountered all the words and colors in different combinations, repeatedly pressed the keys, and have a clear understanding of the instructions.</p><p>Consequently, the task can get easier, leading to a reduction in the self-control demands of the task. However, as the same stimuli appear and the same keys are pressed over a longer period, the task might also get more and more boring. Thus, while potentially less effort is required to deal with the structural difficulties of the task, more effort might be needed to ward of the boredom-induced urge to get the task over with <ref type="bibr">(Bieleke et al., 2021)</ref>. Notably, recent research indicates that both difficult and boring tasks can contribute to fatigue <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Pickering et al., 2023)</ref>. Fatigue is related to a decreased perception of value in exerting effort and less willingness to continue investing effort <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Dora et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Müller &amp; Apps, 2019)</ref>. Thus, maintaining focus on a task can become more effortful over time due to fatigue resulting from both task difficulty and boredom. While perceived task difficulty and taskinduced boredom are likely to dynamically vary in hard and easy tasks, it is likely that these dynamics are not identical. More specifically, hard and easy tasks likely differ in their perceived difficulty and boringness from the start, and the temporal dynamics of perceived difficulty and boringness are likely to follow different trajectories too <ref type="bibr">(Bieleke et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Wolff &amp; Martarelli, 2020)</ref>. As a result, it is possible for both easy and hard tasks to exhibit various levels of effort throughout their execution. By exclusively assessing perceived effort in relation to task difficulty (as is traditionally done in self-control research), the additional effort requirements that can arise from task-induced boredom might be overlooked.</p><p>Furthermore, assessing perceived effort only after task completion neglects the temporal fluctuations in effort demands during a self-control-demanding task.</p><p>To uncouple the temporal dynamics of effort (due to task difficulty and boredom) and boredom during different self-control tasks, triangulation of methods holds promise. First, self-reports can provide a valuable reading of people's state <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Cooper-Martin, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Johnson et al., 1995)</ref> and researchers have highlighted the need to track the dynamics of people's feelings with higher resolution <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Mills &amp; Christoff, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Waugh et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Complementing self-reports, pupil size can serve as a physiological indicator of effort with, generally speaking, greater pupil size indicating increased effort: Phasic (stimulus-evoked) changes in pupil diameter have been found during the completion of various tasks that require effort with a greater pupil size being related to a greater extend of effort (e.g., in inhibition, updating, working memory tasks; <ref type="bibr">van der Wel &amp; van Steenbergen, 2018. Moreover, pupil</ref> size measurements, as an objective physiological measure of effort, show consistency and correlate with the self-reported perception of effort (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Koelewijn et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Wals &amp; Wichary, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Zénon et al., 2014)</ref>.</p><p>While phasic (stimulus-evoked) changes in pupil size tend to occur as reactions to the immediate demands of a task, tonic (baseline) pupil changes tend to reflect the state of the individual more generally <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Cohen Hoffing et al., 2020)</ref>. Considering changes of pupil size from a general psychophysiological perspective, the activation of the sympathetic pathway of the autonomic nervous system leads to the dilation of the pupil whereas the activation of the parasympathetic pathway induces its constriction <ref type="bibr">(Kardon, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Mathôt, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">McDougal &amp; Gamlin, 2008)</ref>. While our understanding of the exact neurological processes of pupil dilation during the exertion of effort is somewhat restricted <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Mathôt, 2018)</ref>, we do know that the locus coeruleus (LC), a brain area suggested to play an important role in behavioral regulation and, consequently, self-control <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Aston-Jones &amp; Cohen, 2005)</ref>, affects changes in pupil size. Research indicates that when the LC is more active, the pupils tend to enlarge <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Joshi et al., 2016)</ref>. Connections from the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) to the LC were found <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Aston-Jones et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Rajkowski et al., 2000)</ref>. As those brain regions are linked to the evaluation of rewards and costs, a responsiveness of the LC to ongoing cost-reward evaluations is suggested, consequently shaping the resulting behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Aston-Jones &amp; Cohen, 2005)</ref>. Given the association of the LC activation to cost-reward evaluations and self-control, the relation to pupil size, and the link between greater effort and larger pupils, these findings imply that the LC likely contributes to the dilation of pupils when self-control and effort (either difficulty-or boredom-related) are exerted during the engagement in cognitive tasks. Research investigating the dynamics of pupil dilation during the performance of cognitive tasks has demonstrated a gradual reduction in phasic (stimulus-evoked) pupil diameter during the execution of both high and low cognitive-demanding tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Hopstaken et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Timme et al., 2022)</ref>. This decline in pupil dilation aligns with the reduced demands and required effort of cognitive tasks over time.</p><p>However, pupil size has not only been found to decrease over time but also to increase <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Bijleveld, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Timme et al., 2022)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Bijleveld (2018)</ref> reported that both the perceived feeling of effort and physiological effort, as measured by phasic peak pupil dilation, increased over time in easy and hard trials of a cognitively demanding task. This increase aligns well with the idea of a rise in boredom over time and the proposal that staying engaged with a boring task might enhance the effort that has to be invested to complete the task <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">(Wolff &amp; Martarelli, 2020)</ref>. Although <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Hopstaken et al. (2015)</ref> did not explicitly mention this observation, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref> in their paper suggests a tendency of an increase in phasic peak pupil dilation in the first block of the task (which had a comparable duration to the whole task in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Bijleveld, 2018)</ref> before the peak pupil dilation started to decrease over time. This could indicate a progressive increase in boredom, starting early in the task and intensifying over time and related to this, an increase in effort needed to keep a good performance while the individual's willingness to perform is still present. Over time other mechanisms might become more relevant in explaining total pupil dilation, such as the individual's decision to stop investing effort into the task all together, which could result from too high levels of boredom or fatigue. This idea aligns well with motivational theories like the motivational intensity theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Brehm &amp; Self, 1989)</ref>, which suggests that effort is only mobilized to the degree that is justified by a tasks potential reward value. Within this framework, it is conceivable that fluctuations in boredom alter how much effort should be mobilized toward the task because boredom has been theorized to reduce the value people ascribe to a boredom-inducing activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">(Wolff &amp; Martarelli, 2020)</ref>. However, it should be noted that <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Timme et al. (2022)</ref> found the averaged pupil dilation over a period of ten minutes to first decrease before showing a tendency to increase, which is opposite to the findings of other two studies described above. Although pupil dilation was calculated differently in this study, these differences demonstrate the persistent uncertainty regarding how and why the perception of effort and physiological indicators of effort change during the performance of cognitive tasks over longer periods of time. Moreover, none of these studies included the assessment of boredom. Although it is highly speculative why these differences in results emerge between studies, it highlights the importance of employing a combination of selfreport and pupillometry to allow for a deeper comprehension of the temporal dynamics of task difficulty and boredom dependent effort during self-controlled behavior.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Present Study</head><p>In the present study, we investigated how effortful task-induced boredom is subjectively perceived and if it can be physiologically tracked. To achieve this, we assessed the temporal dynamics of task difficulty and boredom related effort during the performance of an easy and hard version of a cognitive task <ref type="bibr">(Stroop task)</ref>. We integrated a promising research protocol that complemented the subjective assessment of perceived effort with the implementation of pupillometry (tonic and phasic pupil size) as objective measure of effort, resulting in a high temporal resolution of physiological and subjective data. Subjective experiences were assessed several times during the experiment with thought probes asking for the perception of boredom, task difficulty, task difficulty related effort, boredom related effort, overall effort, and fatigue. Thereby, we understand task difficulty related effort as the perception of effort that individuals feel like having to expend into the task in response to the experienced task difficulty, and boredom related effort as the perception of effort that individuals have to expend into the task in response to the experience of boredom. A secondary task (flanker task) was included in our study to further assess how the processing of the first task influences performance in the second task. However, note that our primary focus was on examining the temporal dynamics of task difficulty and boredom related effort in the easy and hard version of the first task <ref type="bibr">(Stroop task)</ref>. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study directly assessing the perception of effort due to boredom and disentangling task difficulty and boredom related effort. Moreover, implementing a within-subjects design, this study contributes valuable insights into how boredom and effort interact across varying difficulty levels of cognitive tasks within the same participants. By uncoupling effort from its direction (i.e., effort to deal with an intrinsically hard task vs. effort to keep working on a boring task), this study addresses the research gap on how enduring boredom impacts effort during the performance of cognitive tasks. As a result, this study enhances our understanding of boredom and its role in self-control. We predicted boredom and boredom related effort to increase over time while we assumed task difficulty and task difficulty related effort to decrease. Furthermore, we predicted that pupil size (tonic and phasic) is predicted more accurately by overall cognitive effort (difficulty-and boredom-related) than by effort related solely to task difficulty.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample Characteristics</head><p>To ensure a significant difference in the difficulty level and the potential for boredom induction by our tasks, we conducted an online study that included four Stroop task versions (easy and hard versions of color Stroop and numerical Stroop, see Appendix A). Based on the results, we concluded that the color Stroop task was the most suitable variant for our study.</p><p>To determine the required sample size for the present study, we conducted a G*Power Analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Faul et al., 2007)</ref>. Given that the effect size observed in the calculated t-tests was larger for task difficulty (d = 0.92) than for boredom (d = 0.34), our power analysis focused on the effect size of the difference in boredom between the easy and the hard color Stroop.</p><p>Thus, we adopted a conservative approach in calculating the required sample size. The power analysis for a one-tailed paired t-test was calculated based on this effect size. The analysis indicated that 95 participants were necessary to detect a difference in boredom between the tasks with a power of 95% at an alpha level of 0.05. Replacement participants were recruited to achieve the calculated sample size, when participants drop out, z-transformed error rate in the Stroop task was more than three standard deviations away from the mean of all participants or errors in the recording of oculomotor data occurred (i.e., participants for whom the calibration procedure did not work correctly, indicated by an average error in measuring horizontal and vertical eye positions exceeding an angular accuracy of 0.8°). A total of 110 participants took part in at least one session. However, 15 participants were excluded based on these criteria: five completed only one session (two of them due to measurement errors in their first session), five had excessive error rates, five were excluded due to incomplete oculomotor data. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">3</ref>After exclusions, ninety-five participants without self-reported color blindness remained in the sample (M = 20.22 years, SD = 4.48, age range = 16 to 45 years; 75.79% women, 23.16% men, 1% other gender). All participants were recruited from the general population and from our institute.</p><p>Participants provided written informed consent and were free to end the experiment at any time. Parental consent was not required for participants under 18 years of age (i.e., 16 or 17 years old). They received 100 CHF as compensation. The local Ethics Committee approved the study, which was conducted according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Materials and Design</head><p>In this within-subjects design, study participants took part in two sessions separated by at least one day, each consisting of a Stroop task and a subsequent flanker task. In one session, participants completed the Stroop task in its easy congruent-only version (easy Stroop), while in the other session, they completed the hard version with modified instructions (hard Stroop). Pupil size and thought probe data were recorded during the Stroop task only, while behavioral data (response time, accuracy) was recorded during both tasks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Tasks</head><p>Stroop task. As primary task participants performed a color Stroop task (original Stroop task version first implemented by <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Stroop, (1935)</ref> comprising 34 practice trials and 360 experimental trials. Each trial consisted of the presentation of fixation stimuli (###, including pixels of all four colors of the color words to ensure a more similar luminance, displayed for 1000 ms on screen), a color word (green, red, blue, yellow) that was presented for 400 ms either in green (RGB: 0,85,0,255), blue (RGB: 0,0,85,255), red (RGB: 85,0,0,255) or yellow (RGB: 85,85,0,255), a blank screen (displayed until reaction or for 1500 ms), and an intertrial interval (displayed for 1500 ms). Participants were instructed to press one of four keys on the depression scores. keyboard ("1" for green, "2" for blue, "9" for red, "0" for yellow) to indicate their response.</p><p>The background of the screen was displayed in grey <ref type="bibr">(RGB: 150,</ref><ref type="bibr">150,</ref><ref type="bibr">150,</ref><ref type="bibr">255)</ref>. Self-control demands and the induction of boredom were manipulated using an easy version of the Stroop task and a hard version with modified instructions. While in the easy condition participants received the instruction to indicate the color of the presented color word, the task in the hard condition switched according to another stimulus presented on screen, which either demanded to indicate the color if a "+" was displayed (in 80 % of trials) or the word if a "x" was displayed (in 20% of trials). The instructions informed participants that in the easy condition all trials would be congruent (color and color word matching), whereas in the hard condition all trials would be incongruent (color and word not matching each other, see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1 A</ref>). Response times and accuracy served as performance indicators.</p><p>Flanker task. As secondary task, participants performed a flanker task (original task version first implemented by <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Eriksen &amp; Eriksen, 1974)</ref>, comprising 24 practice trials and 140 experimental trials. Each trial consisted of fixation stimuli (###, displayed for 1000 ms on screen), five arrows presented on the middle of the screen, and an intertrial interval (displayed for 500 ms). The arrows remained on screen until participants pressed the keys "1" for right or "0" for left, indicating the direction of which the central arrow was pointing. The other four arrows were either congruent and pointed to the same direction as the central arrow (50 % of all trials) or incongruent and thus pointing to the contrary direction (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1 B</ref>).</p><p>The task performance (accuracy, response times) was recorded. The flanker task was implemented to investigate potential effects of the primary tasks on secondary task performance. Note. Naming the font color ("+" presented next to the word) was the task in 80 % of the trials of the hard Stroop task (A). In 20 % of the trials an "x" was presented and thus, the task was to indicate the word. All trials of the hard Stroop task were incongruent whereas all trials of the easy Stroop task were congruent. Flanker task trials (B) were either incongruent or congruent (50 % of all trials).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Thought Probes</head><p>During the Stroop task participants were prompted eleven times to report how bored they were ("How much boredom do you feel?"), as how difficult they were experiencing the task ("How difficult is the task?"), how much effort they were investing due to task difficulty ("Due to the difficulty of the task, how much effort do you have to invest into the task?"), due to boredom ("Due to boredom, how much effort do you have to invest into the task?") and overall ("Overall, how much effort do you have to invest into the task?"), and how much fatigue they were experiencing ("How much fatigue do you feel?"). They indicated their answer by pressing a key between 1 (not at all) and 9 (very much) on their keyboard. The probes were displayed randomly after blocks of 30 to 35 trials. The order of the probes was randomized for each presentation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pupil Size</head><p>Tonic (baseline) pupil size and phasic (stimulus-evoked) pupil size during the tasks were recorded at a sampling rate of 1000 Hz, a spatial resolution of 0.01°, and a gaze position accuracy of 0.05° using an EyeLink 1000 Plus eye-tracker. A chinrest was placed at a distance of 45 cm to the monitor (1920 x 1080 pixels) in order to prevent head movements.</p><p>At the start of the experiment the eye-tracker was calibrated and validated using a 9-point grid. Participants, whose average horizontal and vertical error exceeded an angular accuracy of 0.8° were excluded. The testing room was cut off from external light sources, and it was not illuminated throughout all testing sessions.</p><p>The data was extracted using EyeLink DataViewer version 3.4.1. Missing data points due to off-screen fixations or eye blinks were removed before analyzing pupil diameter. Pupil size is reported for the right eye and reported in pixels. Tonic (baseline) pupil size was averaged separately for each last 500 ms of the fixation stimuli (###) presentation. Phasic (stimulus-evoked) peak pupil dilation for each trial was obtained by correcting peak pupil dilation during the presentation of the blank screen (as this time period typically corresponds to the occurring of peak pupillary response in the Stroop task, see for example <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Hershman &amp; Henik, 2020)</ref> for baseline pupil size (averaged pupil size during a period of 500 ms before stimulus onset). Both tonic (baseline) pupil size and phasic (stimulus-evoked) pupil size were averaged in blocks with each block consisting of the last five trials before each probe. A larger phasic (stimulus-evoked) peak pupil dilation served as indicator for higher stimulus-induced cognitive effort. Conversely, a lager tonic (baseline) pupil size served as indicator for higher cognitive effort, irrespective of the effort induced by the task stimulus. Analyzing tonic (baseline) pupil size is essential for our research question as effort related to boredom persists throughout the whole trial, i.e., during the presentation of the fixation stimuli and during the presentation of the task stimulus.</p><p>Relying solely on tonic pupil size as a means of baseline correcting stimulus-evoked pupil size and not analyzing it independently would neglect the possible effect of the endurance of boredom on cognitive effort and could lead to an overlook of this effect.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Supplementary Measures</head><p>In addition to the measures needed to investigate the core research question of this paper we implemented supplementary measures to provide a more comprehensive description of the sample and to enhance our understanding of experiencing boredom and related characteristics. For this purpose, participants completed three questionnaires before taking part in the experiment, the Short Boredom Proneness Scale (SBPS; <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Struk et al., 2017)</ref>; German version by <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Martarelli et al., 2021)</ref>, the Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Beck et al., 1996)</ref>; German version by <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Kühner et al., 2007)</ref>, and the Brief Self-control Scale (BSCS; <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Tangney et al., 2018)</ref>; German version by <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bertrams &amp; Dickhäuser, 2009)</ref>. They also indicated whether they had been diagnosed with ADHD. They completed the questionnaire online via a link provided by the experimenter, which directed them to a LimeSurvey form<ref type="foot" target="#foot_3">foot_3</ref> .</p><p>On average, 29.33 days (SD = 20.27) elapsed between completing the questionnaire and attending the first experimental session. Immediately before beginning the session, participants indicated if they had consumed any stimulants on the day of testing (caffeine, nicotine, amphetamine, others), and whether they felt sleep deprived ("Do you feel sleep deprived?" Answered with "yes" or "no"). If participants indicated that they had taken stimulants before the first session, they were asked to do the same before the second session⁴.</p><p>Responses were included in the sample description. After completing the experiment, participants were offered to take with them some sweets. The amount chosen by each participant was measured. The corresponding analyses and characteristics of participants are provided in Appendix D.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure</head><p>Before starting the first experimental session in the laboratory, participants answered the Short Boredom Proneness Scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Struk et al., 2017)</ref>, the Brief Self-Control Questionnaire <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Tangney et al., 2018)</ref> and the BDI-II <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Beck et al., 1996)</ref> as well as the other supplementary measures online. Afterwards they received an invitation to the laboratory together with the request not to drink any coffee at least for two hours before the start of the experiment. In each study part, online and offline, participants were informed about the experimental procedure and asked to consent into the study conditions. The experimental part of the study consisted of two sessions. Every participant took part in both sessions (within-subjects design). Before each session participants reported if they had consumed any stimulants on the day of testing. The procedure of both experimental sessions (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>) was similar with the difference that the first sequential paradigm task <ref type="bibr">(Stroop task)</ref> was an easy version in one session and a hard in the other one. Both sessions involved the flanker task as secondary task.</p><p>The order of the sessions was counterbalanced. Each session took approximately 40 to 50 minutes. During the task, participants answered to probes indicating their perception of boredom, task difficulty, effort they had to invest due to boredom and due to task difficulty, overall effort and fatigue. There was a break of at least one day in between the sessions (M = 11.88, SD = 11.32, range from 1 to 52).</p><p>In the experimental sessions participants placed their head on a chinrest and looked at the screen (at 45 cm distance to head) where the tasks were presented while oculomotor data (pupil size) and behavioral data (task performance, probe answers) was recorded. Participants were instructed to stay as still as possible, to direct their gaze to the center of the screen and to answer the questions (probes) presented on screen by pressing the corresponding number on the keyboard without removing their head from the chinrest. Note. Behavioral data (reaction time, accuracy) was recorded during the Stroop task and during the Flanker task. Pupil and thought probe data was recorded during the Stroop task only.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pre-Test</head><p>To test the feasibility of our study design we tested two participants and recorded pupil size (tonic and phasic pupil size) and the answers to the thought probes before starting the main study. See Appendix B for the corresponding descriptive data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Transparency and Openness</head><p>We share the dataset of our online study as well as the R code to reproduce our analyses on Open Science Framework (OSF) available at <ref type="url" target="https://osf.io/jn54q/">https://osf.io/jn54q/</ref>. We further incorporated the research materials, the full non-aggregated dataset as well as the analysis scripts for the present study. The data was analyzed using R, version 4.3.1 (R Core Team,</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2023).</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>We first report the manipulation check, followed by temporal analyses of the thought probes, analyses of the relationship between effort and pupil size, and finally, the impact of completing the first task <ref type="bibr">(Stroop)</ref> on performance in the second task (Flanker). Statistical significance for all analyses was evaluated at α = .05 (two sided)⁴. For further details on preregistered analyses, see Appendix C (Study-Design Template).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Manipulation Check</head><p>We confirmed the effectiveness of our experimental manipulations by assessing their impact on participants' subjective perception and performance. This manipulation check allowed us to ensure that the intended differences between the conditions concerning the manipulated difficulty level were indeed present.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Task Difficulty</head><p>We hypothesized that the hard condition would exhibit significantly greater overall perceived task difficulty compared to the easy condition. To test this hypothesis, we performed a paired t-test comparing the overall task difficulty (dependent variable) in the easy and hard Stroop (difficulty level as independent variable). The overall perceived task difficulty was calculated as the mean of the perceived difficulty ratings for the answered probes. As expected, results revealed a significant lower perceived task difficulty in the easy (M = 3.02, SD = 1.77) compared to the hard (M = 6.66, SD = 1.73) task, with a large effect size, t(94) = -18.98, p &lt; .001, d = -1.95.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Boredom</head><p>In the context of boredom levels, we expected the easy condition to induce significantly greater overall boredom compared to the hard condition. To evaluate this hypothesis, we conducted a paired t-test comparing overall boredom (dependent variable) in the easy and hard condition (difficulty level as independent variable). Overall boredom was obtained by calculating the mean of the boredom ratings for the answered probes. As expected, the analysis confirmed that perceived boredom was significantly greater in the easy (M = 5.47, SD = 1.75) compared to the hard (M = 3.99, SD = 1.94) task, with a moderate effect size, t(94) = 6.81, p &lt; .001, d = 0.70.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Performance</head><p>Performance differences between the two conditions were assessed by examining error rates and reaction times. We expected participants to demonstrate a greater error rate and longer reaction time in the hard condition compared to the easy condition. We conducted two paired t-tests, one comparing the error rate and one comparing the reaction time between the easy and hard condition, implementing the error rate and the reaction time as dependent variables each in one analysis and the difficulty level (easy, hard) as independent variable. Error rates and reaction times were calculated as the mean values across all completed trials, including correct and incorrect responses⁴. Consistent with our hypothesis, results indicated significant lower error rates in the easy (M = 0.04, SD = 0.04) compared to the hard (M = 0.19, SD = 0.13) Stroop, t(94) = -11.73, p &lt; .001, d = -3.16. Similarly, the paired t-test for reaction time showed that participants were significantly faster in the easy (M = 707.45 ms, SD = 108.57 ms) compared to the hard (M = 1138.90 ms, SD = 162.69 ms) Stroop, t(94) = -30.79, p &lt; .001, d = -3.16.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Thought Probes</head><p>We expected changes over time in participants' self-reports for both the easy and the hard variant of the task. Changes over time concerning those variables were analyzed conducting six linear mixed models including the perception of boredom, boredom related effort, task difficulty and task difficulty related effort, overall effort and fatigue as outcome variables, task (easy, hard) and time (probe one to eleven) as fixed effects accounting for differences among participants by including random intercepts and different effects of time on the outcome variables by including random slopes for time. We expected a main effect of time. More precisely, we expected an increase in boredom, boredom related effort, fatigue, and overall effort and a decrease of task difficulty and task difficulty related effort over time for both Stroop versions (easy and hard). Further, we predicted a main effect of difficulty level (easy, hard). We anticipated greater levels of boredom and greater boredom related effort, but less task difficulty and task difficulty related effort for the easy Stroop version. We expected an interaction for perceived task difficulty and task difficulty related effort with a greater decrease over time in the hard Stroop. We further expected an interaction for perceived overall effort with a greater increase in overall effort in the easy Stroop version.</p><p>Six plots (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>) showing the time (probe one to eleven) on the x-axis, the scores on the y-axis, and two different lines for the two tasks, illustrate how the perception of boredom, boredom related effort, task difficulty related effort, task difficulty, fatigue and effort change over time.</p><p>Results of our linear mixed models supported most hypotheses. As expected, the analysis for task difficulty revealed a significant interaction between task and time (γ₀₃ = -0.15, t = -12.04, p &lt; 0.001, 95% CI [-0.17, -0.12]), indicating a greater decrease in difficulty over time in the hard Stroop. However, in contrast to our expectations, difficulty did not decrease in the easy Stroop. In addition, main effects of time (γ₀₁ = 0.04, t = 2.71, p = 0.008, 95% CI [0.01, 0.08]) and task <ref type="bibr">(γ₀₂ = 4.52,</ref><ref type="bibr">t = 54.35,</ref><ref type="bibr">p &lt; 0.001,</ref><ref type="bibr">95% CI [4.36,</ref><ref type="bibr">4.69]</ref>) were observed, showing a general increase in difficulty over time and overall higher difficulty ratings in the hard Stroop.</p><p>As hypothesized, the model predicting effort due to task difficulty showed a significant interaction of time and task (γ₀₃ = -0.12, t = -9.25, p &lt; 0.001, 95% CI [-0.14, -0.09]), with a greater decrease in task difficulty related effort over time in the hard Stroop.</p><p>However, in contrast to our predictions, and similar to the trajectory of task difficulty, difficulty related effort did not decrease in the easy Stroop. Additionally, main effects of time (γ₀₃ = -0.12, t = -9.25, p &lt; 0.001, 95% CI [-0.14, -0.09]) and task (γ₀₂ = 4.16, t = 47.90, p &lt; 0.001, 95% <ref type="bibr">CI [3.99,</ref><ref type="bibr">4.34)</ref> were significant, indicating a general increase in difficulty related effort over time as well as higher reported difficulty related effort in the hard Stroop task.</p><p>Regarding boredom, the analysis revealed a significant interaction between task and time (γ₀₃ = -0.04, t = -3.00, p = 0.003, 95% CI [-0.07, -0.01]), revealing a greater increase in boredom over time in the easy Stroop. As expected, we observed significant main effects of time (γ₀₁ = 0.03, t = 15.54, p &lt; 0.001, 95% CI [0.26, 0.34]) and task (γ₀₂ = -1.23, t = -12.80, p &lt; 0.001, 95% CI [-1.41, -1.04]), with increases in boredom in both tasks and significantly lower boredom in the hard Stroop task.</p><p>The model for boredom related effort showed a significant interaction between task and time (γ₀₃ = -0.07, t = -4.36, p &lt; 0.001, 95% CI [-0.10, -0.04]), indicating a greater increase in boredom related effort over time in the easy Stroop task. In line with our hypothesis, the main effect of time (γ₀₁ = 0.22, t = 10.45, p &lt; 0.001, 95% CI [0.18, 0.27]) was significant, indicating overall increases in boredom related effort over time. The main effect of task was not significant (γ₀₂ = 0.19, t = 1.82, p = 0.069, 95% CI <ref type="bibr">[-0.54, 0.39]</ref>).</p><p>As hypothesized, the analysis for overall effort revealed a significant interaction between task and time (γ₀₃ = -0.18, t = -14.40, p &lt; 0.001, 95% CI [-0.20, -0.16]), indicating a greater increase in overall effort in the easy Stroop task over time while overall effort in the hard Stroop task even tend to decrease. Additionally, as predicted, a significant main effect of time (γ₀₁ = 0.13, t = 8.81, p &lt; 0.001, 95% CI [0.10, 0.16]) was observed, indicating increases in overall effort over time.

Results further revealed a significant main effect of task (γ₀₂ = -0.35, t = -3.51, p &lt; 0.001, 95% CI [-0.54, -0.15]), with lower fatigue levels in the hard Stroop task. Our analysis indicated that the interaction between task and time was not significant (γ₀₃ = -0.03, t = -1.95, p = 0.051, 95% CI [-0.06, 0.00]). Note. Linear mixed models revealed a significant main effect of task for all variables except for effort due to boredom (p = .07). They further demonstrated a significant main effect of time across all variables except for effort due to task difficulty (p = .19). Additionally, a significant interaction between time and task was observed for difficulty, effort related to difficulty, boredom, effort related to boredom, and overall effort (all ps &lt; 0.003), but not for fatigue (p = .051). The confidence band indicates the 95% confidence interval.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Effort and Pupil Size</head><p>To test our prediction that pupil size shows a stronger association with perceived boredom related effort and task difficulty related effort together than with task difficulty related effort alone, we analyzed tonic (baseline) pupil size and phasic (stimulus-evoked) pupil size separately. We hypothesized that tonic (baseline) and phasic (stimulus-evoked) pupil sizes would be more accurately predicted when considering both perceived effort due to boredom and effort due to task difficulty, as opposed to considering perceived effort due to task difficulty alone.</p><p>To investigate this hypothesis, we employed eight linear mixed models (LMM) to assess the influence of these factors on tonic pupil size and phasic pupil size separately.</p><p>Detailed model outputs are provided in Appendix E. Tonic pupil size for each probe was determined by calculating the average tonic (baseline) pupil size (pupil size during the last 500 ms of the presentation of the fixation stimuli) across the last five trials preceding the probe presentation. Phasic pupil size for each probe was determined by calculating the peak stimulus-evoked pupil size. After baseline correcting phasic pupil size it was averaged across the last five trials preceding the probe presentation. We constructed four different models for each outcome variable (tonic pupil size, phasic pupil size). All models were calculated using the lmer function from the lme4 package in R version 4.3.1. (R Core Team, 2023) with the standard optimizer "nloptwrap"⁴. However, model three predicting tonic pupil size, as well as models one, three, and four predicting phasic pupil size, were estimated using the optimizer "bobyqa" due to convergence issues with the standard optimizer. The presented confidence intervals correspond to the non-standardized estimates.</p><p>Our first model predicted pupil size with the task's difficulty level (easy, hard), time (thought probe/block one to eleven), and perceived effort due to task difficulty as fixed predictors, accounting for general differences between participants in tonic and phasic pupil size by including random intercepts and different effects of time on pupil size among participants by including random slopes for the variable time. Results of model one indicated a significant main effect of the task's difficulty level (easy, hard) (γ01 = 42.02, β = 0.14, t = 4.48, p &lt; 0.001, 95% <ref type="bibr">CI [3.22,</ref><ref type="bibr">11.68]</ref>), time (γ02 = -6.25, β = -0.07, t = -2.96, p = 0.003, 95% <ref type="bibr">CI [3.22,</ref><ref type="bibr">11.68]</ref>), and effort related to task difficulty (γ₀₃ = = 7.45, β = 0.06, t = 3.45, p &lt; 0.001, 95% <ref type="bibr">CI [3.22,</ref><ref type="bibr">11.68]</ref>) on tonic pupil size. While the task's difficulty level (γ01 = 44.78, β = 0.75, t = 20.13, p &lt; 0.001, 95% <ref type="bibr">CI [40.42,</ref><ref type="bibr">49.14]</ref>) and time (γ02 = -1.31, β = -0.07, t = -4.24, p &lt; 0.001, 95% CI [-1.92, -0.71]) were also significantly related to phasic pupil size, contrary to our expectations, the main effect of effort related to task difficulty was not significant (γ03 = 0.71, β = 0.03, t = -0.27, p = 0.158, 95% CI <ref type="bibr">[-0.27, 1.70]</ref>). Thus, tonic and phasic pupil size were larger during the hard Stroop version and decreased over time. The effects of the task's difficulty level and time remained similar in all models (see Appendix E for full estimates). Furthermore, tonic pupil size but not phasic pupil size was larger for participants reporting greater effort related to task difficulty.</p><p>Our second model differed from model one by implementing effort due to boredom as fixed predictor instead of effort due to task difficulty.

In contrast to our expectations, boredom related effort was not significantly related to tonic pupil size (γ04 = 2.58, β = 0.02, t = 1.41, p = 0.158, 95% CI [-1.01, 6.17]), but significantly related to phasic pupil size (γ04 = -0.87, β = -0.03, t = -2.04, p = 0.042, 95% CI [-1.71, -0.03]), with smaller phasic pupil sizes when boredom related effort increased.</p><p>Our fourth model expanded upon model three by including additional covariates, namely participants' score of the Short Boredom Proneness Scale (SBPS), the Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II), and the Brief Self-Control Scale (BSCS; descriptive statistics and internal consistencies for these scales are reported in Appendix E, Table <ref type="table">6</ref>). This model continued to show similar results to model three. Neither the SBPS, nor the BSCS or BDI-II scores were significantly related to pupil sizes (see Appendix E for the detailed model output).

Results are reported in Appendix F.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>This study examined the temporal dynamics of perceived effort (overall, boredom Consistent with our predictions, ratings of perceived boredom, boredom related effort, difficulty, difficulty related effort, overall effort, and fatigue changed over time. Specifically, boredom, boredom related effort, and overall effort increased more strongly over time in the easy Stroop task. For perceived difficulty and difficulty related effort, ratings decreased more strongly over time in the hard Stroop task, whereas they did not decrease in the easy task.</p><p>Given that boredom was particularly high in the easy Stroop, it is possible that the increased sensation of boredom contributed to a perception that, over time, the task was becoming more difficult or at least not easier. In contrast, no significant interaction between task and time emerged for fatigue. Instead, main effects indicated that participants reported greater fatigue over time in both tasks, and higher overall fatigue levels in the easy Stroop. Similarly, participants reported more boredom in the easy Stroop, and greater difficulty, difficulty related effort, and overall boredom in the hard Stroop.</p><p>These temporal dynamics align with results of previous research on fatigue and effort related to boredom and task difficulty <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Radtke et al., 2025)</ref>. The results suggest that regardless of whether a task is easy or difficult, it becomes more boring over time, likely increasing boredom related effort. This supports the idea that boredom prompts the exploration of alternative behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Agrawal et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Bench &amp; Lench, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Danckert, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Geana et al., 2016)</ref>, increasing the opportunity costs of continuing the current task <ref type="bibr">(Bieleke &amp; Wolff, 2021a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Bieleke et al., 2023)</ref>. As a result, sustaining engagement in the boring task is presumably perceived as more effortful <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">(Wolff &amp; Martarelli, 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Meanwhile, even though task difficulty and difficulty related effort decrease over time in hard tasks, fatigue increases in both task conditions. Combined with the finding that overall fatigue is higher in the easy compared to the hard Stroop, this suggests that boredom and its associated effort may be even more fatiguing than task difficulty and difficulty related effort.</p><p>This aligns with previous research reporting greater fatigue during and greater increases of fatigue following boring tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Mangin et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Milyavskaya et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Radtke et al., 2025)</ref>, but contrasts with research suggesting greater fatigue after more cognitive demanding tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Kurzban et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Marcora et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">O'Keeffe et al., 2019)</ref>. While the temporal dynamics of fatigue mirror those of boredom related effort rather than those of difficulty related effort, participants' perception of the overall effort required follows the pattern of difficulty related effort in the hard task and boredom related effort in the easy task. Thus, whether a task is overall easy or hard seems to influence whether overall effort while performing a task increases or decreases over time. Another possible explanation is that participants in the hard condition were more engaged, as indicated by the pattern of overall effort, and may therefore not have perceived their exerted effort as fatiguing.</p><p>Overall, these results suggest that, over time, tasks, regardless of their difficulty level, become more boring and more fatiguing, while also the effort that has to be invested due to boredom increases. In contrast, the perceived difficulty, the effort that has to be invested due to the difficulty, and overall effort increase or decrease over time depending on the objective difficulty level of a task, highlighting the relevance of task characteristics in predicting how these variables change over time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Effort and Pupil Size: Boredom and Difficulty Related Effort Reflect in Pupil Size</head><p>Preregistered comparisons between model 1, which predicted pupil size with task, time, and difficulty related effort, and model 3, which additionally included boredom related effort, did not provide consistent support for our hypothesis, as AIC, BIC, and WAIC partly favored model 1 and partly model 3. When extending the model comparisons to all models, including the exploratory model 3ex, which added interactions between task and the effort variables, model 3ex was preferred over all other models. This provided post-hoc support that tonic and phasic pupil size were predicted more accurately by task difficulty related effort and boredom related effort together than by task difficulty related effort alone. As pupil size serves as objective measure and physiological correlate of effort (van der Wel &amp; van Steenbergen, 2018), this result emphasizes the importance of recognizing boredom as a potential confounding variable in research investigating effort and self-control. However, results from our linear mixed models revealed that the relationship between the level of task difficulty (easy, hard), effort related to boredom, effort related to difficulty, and pupil size is complex. Consistent with previous research, pupil size was larger in the hard Stroop and decreased over time in both tasks. This likely reflects the greater cognitive load and overall effort required in the hard task (van der Wel &amp; van Steenbergen, 2018) as well as an adaptation and a reduction in task demands over time <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Hopstaken et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Timme et al., 2022)</ref>.</p><p>Regarding the effect of boredom related effort, our findings highlight distinct patterns in tonic (baseline) and phasic (stimulus-evoked) pupillary responses. Tonic pupil size, reflecting the general state of an individual (Cohen Hoffing et al., 2020), increased with greater boredom related effort in the easy task. This suggests that boredom related effort during easy tasks is not only perceived as effortful but also has physiological correlates.</p><p>Similar, difficulty related effort in the easy Stroop was related to larger tonic pupil sizes. This indicates that both boredom-related and difficulty-related effort contribute to an elevated baseline cognitive load, even in the absence of external stimuli.</p><p>However, these effects were not observed in the hard Stroop task. One possible explanation is that the high cognitive demands of the task, such as remembering four response keys (one for each color) and two different symbols (+ and x) indicating the task for the trial (color naming vs. word reading), resulted in overwhelm and consequently in reduced attention. This could have diminished the effect of boredom and difficulty related effort on tonic pupil size. Supporting this idea, smaller tonic pupil sizes have been associated with lapses in attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Kristjansson et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">van den Brink et al., 2016)</ref>. Another explanation is that the task may have been too difficult, exceeding the optimal challenge level for inducing flow. Supporting this idea, recent research has shown that flow during a cognitive task follows an inverted U-shaped relationship with pupil dilation <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Lu et al., 2023)</ref>.</p><p>Phasic pupil size, which reflects the reactions to the stimulus (Cohen Hoffing et al., 2020), showed a different pattern. Contrary to our expectations, phasic pupil size decreased with greater boredom related effort in both the easy and hard Stroop. This suggests that as boredom related effort increased, participants' stimulus-driven attention and engagement declined. Prior studies have reported similar associations between boredom and reduced ontask attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bench &amp; Lench, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Eastwood et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Westgate &amp; Wilson, 2018)</ref> as well as between attention and phasic pupil size <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Unsworth &amp; Miller, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Unsworth &amp; Robison, 2017)</ref>.</p><p>In contrast to boredom related effort, increases in difficulty related effort were associated with larger phasic pupil sizes in the easy Stroop task, indicating that perceived effort related to difficulty was physiologically reflected in stronger pupillary responses to the stimulus. However, this effect was not observed in the hard Stroop task. One possible explanation is that the cognitive load in the hard Stroop was already so high that any additional effort (due to boredom or task difficulty), did not lead to increases in stimulus-driven responses, but rather to task disengagement and reduced attention, a state that has previously been linked to decreases in phasic pupil size <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Unsworth &amp; Miller, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Unsworth &amp; Robison, 2017)</ref>.</p><p>These findings contribute to an emerging body of literature suggesting that enduring boredom adds additional requirements of self-control and may confound related research outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Francis et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Job et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Mangin &amp; Pageaux, 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Milyavskaya et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Wolff &amp; Martarelli, 2020)</ref>.

This result complements recent findings linking boredom related effort to electrodermal activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Radtke et al., 2025)</ref>. Taken together, our results suggest that enduring boredom in cognitive tasks may not only lead to the perception of effort related to boredom but also be reflected in psychophysiological changes.</p></div>

According to ego depletion and mental fatigue theories, engaging in a cognitively demanding task should impair subsequent performance in another task requiring self-control or executive function <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Baumeister et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Kurzban et al., 2013)</ref>. However, it has been suggested that these effects frequently remain undetected because both tasks require self-control and effort, just for different reasons <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">(Wolff &amp; Martarelli, 2020)</ref>. The easy Stroop task may require more self-control due to boredom related effort, whereas the hard Stroop task requires more self-control due to task difficulty related effort.</p><p>To examine these effects more directly, we conducted linear mixed models to test whether effort related to task difficulty and effort related to boredom in the primary Stroop task predicted performance in the secondary flanker task. Our results indicate that effort related to boredom predicted higher error rates and longer reaction times in the flanker task, whereas the main effect of effort related to task difficulty was not significant. Model comparisons using BIC indicated that the best-fitting model included boredom related effort but not task difficulty related effort (in addition to Stroop task difficulty and flanker congruence). Thus, boredom related effort appears to have the stronger impact on performance.</p><p>As the increase in boredom related effort was greater in the easy Stroop compared to the hard Stroop, and effort due to difficulty was substantially higher in the hard Stroop (M = 6.66, compared to M = 3.02 in the easy Stroop), the weaker role of difficulty related effort in predicting secondary task performance may explain why no significant effect of Stroop task difficulty was observed.</p><p>These results support the notion that, although differences in secondary task performance after completing easy versus difficult tasks are often not observable, this does not imply that the allocation of effort in the secondary task is not affected by the first task <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">(Wolff &amp; Martarelli, 2020)</ref>. However, the most relevant factor influencing secondary task performance seems not necessarily to be the difficulty level of a task, but rather other variables, such as boredom, that further increase the effort an individual has to invest.</p><p>Besides boredom related effort influencing mental fatigue or the depletion of selfcontrol by being effortful <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Baumeister, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Kurzban et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Marcora et al., 2009)</ref>, other mechanisms are possibly contributing to the negative impact of boredom related effort on performance. It is possible that boredom related effort in the Stroop task reduces motivation, thereby increasing the perceived amount of effort that has to be invested in the flanker task. Consequently, the reward value of the flanker task might not justify the effort that has to be invested to perform well (inspired by the motivational intensity theory; <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Brehm &amp; Self, 1989)</ref>. Moreover, from the perspective of the opportunity cost model of effort <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Kurzban et al., 2013)</ref>, boredom may signal that more rewarding alternatives are available, leading to a rise in perceived opportunity costs. This subjective cost may render continued cognitive engagement increasingly aversive, possibly reflected in the increase of boredom related effort. The fact that boredom related effort in the Stroop task negatively predicted flanker task performance, while objective task difficulty, subjective difficulty, and difficulty related effort did not, suggests that subjective opportunity costs, such as those triggered by boredom, might be more relevant than objective task demands in driving performance decrements across sequential tasks. While the opportunity cost model appears to offer the most straightforward explanation for our findings, other theories may also contribute to an explanation for our results, especially when extended to incorporate the role of boredom related effort, as discussed above.</p><p>Additionally, the prolonged endurance of boredom (and the resulting effort invested), may increase stress levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Chao et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Parasuraman &amp; Purohit, 2000)</ref> and negative emotions such as frustration <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">(Wolff et al., 2024)</ref>. These emotional responses, in turn, can reduce attentional control and increase cognitive load, as off-task thoughts related to negative emotions begin to compete for working memory resources <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Plass &amp; Kalyuga, 2019)</ref>.</p><p>Moreover, as boredom is often accompanied by mind-wandering <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">(Zanesco et al., 2024)</ref>, likely as a coping mechanism, this shift in attentional focus could further impair task performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Randall et al., 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Overall, the findings of the present study highlight the importance of considering boredom related effort in self-control and cognitive performance research and, more general, within the broader scope of study designs. However, future research is necessary to improve the understanding of the underlying mechanisms and address several limitations of the present study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations and Future Research</head><p>It is important to acknowledge limitations regarding the measurement of certain constructs in this study. Specifically, despite its successful implementation (i.e., participants did not raise questions about the items and ratings changed over time following different trajectories) in the present and in a related study <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Radtke et al., 2025)</ref>, the validity of items used to assess perceptions of task difficulty, boredom and related effort need further validation. The self-report items used to assess these variables consisted of single-item measures and have not undergone formal psychometric validation. Therefore, the construct validity of these measures cannot be fully established based on the present data. Especially since the temporal patterns did not fully evolve as predicted (i.e., no decrease over time in perceived difficulty and difficulty related effort in the easy Stroop) and, contrary to our hypotheses, greater difficulty related effort was associated with neither larger phasic nor tonic pupil sizes. Nevertheless, in the present data and in <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Radtke et al. (2025)</ref>, these measures demonstrated sensitivity to within-task changes. Additionally, although the variance inflation factors (VIFs) in the linear mixed models remained below 5 for these variables, their mean scores (averaged across all blocks) were correlated. Correlational evidence (Appendix F, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">5</ref>) provides some support for the distinction between difficulty-related effort and boredom-related effort. Their association was modest in the easy Stroop (r = .26, p &lt; .05) but stronger in the hard Stroop (r = .69, p &lt; .01), suggesting that the overlap between the two constructs increases under higher task demands. Moreover, difficulty-related effort was more strongly related to task difficulty and perceived effort, whereas boredom-related effort showed stronger associations with boredom and fatigue. Together, these patterns indicate that the two constructs share variance but also reflect separate processes. Future research is necessary to examine whether difficulty and boredom related effort are accurately captured by our variables and whether they demonstrate adequate construct validity. This could be addressed, for example, by evaluating these ratings and their trajectories in relation to other variables, examining them across different tasks, and incorporating additional physiological or behavioral measures (e.g., task persistence).</p><p>Different variants of the Stroop task exist, each with distinct neural and behavioral impacts <ref type="bibr">(Müller et al., 2024)</ref>. The results reported here may be specific to the methodological choices we made. In particular, a constraint lies in the task switching component of the hard Furthermore, although our results suggest carryover effects between primary and secondary tasks induced by boredom related effort, the exact mechanisms by which boredom related effort influences subsequent performance remain unclear. Future research should investigate underlying mechanisms that lead to an increase in boredom related effort, and mechanisms by which boredom related effort ultimately influences task performance. In summary, the present study demonstrates that while task difficulty is an important factor in determining cognitive effort, boredom can not only trigger additional cognitive effort but even affect performance in subsequent tasks. Increases in boredom related effort are not only subjectively perceived in easy and hard tasks but are also reflected in pupil as a psychophysiological marker of effort during easy tasks.

Our sample was WEIRD (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich and Democratic; <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Henrich et al., 2010)</ref>, relatively young (M = 20.22 years, SD = 4.48, range = 16 -45), predominantly female (75.79%), and consisted of Swiss and German citizens recruited mainly from the general population, including school students, university students, working adults, and unemployed individuals. Although this provides a somewhat broader range than typical university-only samples, caution is warranted when generalizing to older adults, more balanced gender distributions, or other cultural contexts. Especially older adults might experience effort and boredom in cognitive tasks differently due to age-related changes in cognitive control and motivational processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">(Yee et al., 2019)</ref>. Furthermore, the cognitive tasks employed were an easy (congruent) and hard (incongruent, with task-switching component) Stroop variant that consisted of 360 trials each. Therefore, the observed relationships may not generalize to other cognitive control tasks, Stroop versions with different congruency structures, or longer tasks. Additionally, the experiment was completed in the laboratory. Real-world environments may involve more complex dynamics, especially regarding boredom related effort, as the real world offers greater opportunities for distraction than the laboratory. These constraints should be kept in mind when interpreting the findings.</p><p>compensation of up to $1 in two of the sessions. All participants gave informed consent before starting the experiment.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Tasks</head><p>Stroop tasks. The color Stroop versions closely resemble those suggested in the present study. However, there are some distinctions: in the online study, a task reminder remained on screen, and the task was indicated not only by the "+" and "x" on screen during stimulus presentation but also with a fixation cross before stimulus onset which was either a "+" or an "x". To maintain gaze at the center of the screen, we omitted the task reminder for the present study. Further, we showed the same fixation stimuli (###) in both tasks to keep the physiological influence on baseline (tonic) pupil size consistent across both task versions. To improve the quality of the pupillary data, we presented the stimuli for a fixed duration of 400 ms, instead of presenting them until participants react as we did in the online study. Lastly, while the hard Stroop task in the online study consisted of 50% incongruent trials, the hard Stroop task in the present study consisted of 100% incongruent trials. This change is implemented with the aim to (1) increase the overall difficulty of the hard task and ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>) enhance the clarity of our analysis, particularly regarding pupillary reactions, as pupil size is greater in incongruent than in congruent trials. Otherwise, by calculating the mean of the five trials preceding the probe, congruent and incongruent trials would get mixed up.</p><p>In the numerical Stroop version <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Schwarz &amp; Ischebeck, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Tzelgov et al., 1992)</ref> each trial consisted of a fixation cross (displayed for 1000 on screen), two presented numbers (one with a larger numerical value and one in a larger font size), and an intertrial interval lasting 500 ms. The numbers remained on screen until participants pressed one of two keys on the keyboard ("1" for left, "0" for right) to indicate their response. In the easy congruentonly version one number was both larger in value and in font size. Participants were instructed to identify the number with the larger font size. In the hard version, the numbers were presented either congruent or incongruent (50 % of the trials). In incongruent trials one number was larger in font size while the other was larger in value. The instructions switched during the task. In 80 % of the trials, participants instructed to indicate the number with the lager font size, and in 20 % of the trials, they were instructed to indicate the number with the larger numerical value. A task reminder was displayed on screen. The task was further indicated by an "x" (indicate which number has the larger numerical value) or an "+"</p><p>(indicate which number has a larger font size).</p><p>Subjective experience. After completing each task participants were asked to indicate how much they agree or disagree with statements about their experience during the task on a 9-point Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree, 9 = strongly agree).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Results of a two-way repeated measures ANOVA which was performed to analyze the effect of task variant (color Stroop, numerical Stroop) and difficulty level (easy, hard) on boredom revealed a main effect of task variant (F(1, 204) = 4.90, p = .028, partial η² = 0.002), indicating that participants perceived the numerical Stroop (M = 5.67 , SD = 2.78) as more boring than the color Stroop (M = 5.42, SD = 2.78). Additionally, a main effect of difficulty level was observed (F(1, 204) = 35.51, p &lt; .001, partial η² = 0.017), highlighting that the easy tasks (M = 5.90, SD = 2.72) were more boring than the difficult tasks (M = 5.19, SD = 2.74). There was no significant interaction between the effect of task variant and level of difficulty (F(1, 204) = 2.98, p = .086, partial η² = 0.001).</p><p>Another two-way repeated measures ANOVA analyzing the effect of task variant (color Stroop, numerical Stroop) and difficulty level (easy, hard) on perceived task difficulty indicated a main effect of task version (F(1, 204) = 96.46, p &lt; .001, partial η² = 0.060), with a higher perceived task difficulty in the color Stroop (M = 3.75, SD = 2.58) than in the numerical Stroop (M = 2.68, SD = 2.03). The ANOVA further revealed a main effect of difficulty level (F(1, 204) = 170.31, p &lt; .001, partial η² = 0.116), with a higher perceived task difficulty in the hard (M = 3.99, SD = 2.52) than in the easy (M = 2.44, SD = 1.94) tasks. A significant interaction effect was found between task variant and difficulty level (F(1, 204) = 76.80, p &lt; .001, partial η² = 0.043). This interaction suggests that the impact of difficulty level (easy, hard) on perceived task difficulty depends on the task variant (color, numerical).</p><p>Specifically, in the color Stroop task, participants perceived the task to be more difficult in the hard (M = 4.98, SD = 2.55) compared to the easy condition (M = 2.53, SD = 1.95).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>In both versions of the Stroop task (color, numerical) participants found the hard versions to be more difficult and less boring than the easy counterparts. Overall, the color Stroop was perceived as more difficult and less boring than the numerical Stroop. The difference in perceived task difficulty between the two difficulty levels was more pronounced in the color than in the numerical Stroop variant. Consequently, the color Stroop emerges as the more suitable choice for the present study. Thus, we focused our power analysis on the difference in boredom between the hard and the easy color Stroop (d = 0.34) to adopt a conservative approach in calculating the required sample size.   Pupil size (tonic and phasic), as physiological indicator of effort, is predicted more accurately by task-difficulty-related effort and boredomrelated effort than by task-difficulty related effort alone.</p><p>We will construct four Linear Mixed Models (LMM) for each outcome variable (tonic pupil size, phasic pupil size). Difficulty level of the task (easy, hard), time (thought probe one to eleven), effort due to task difficulty and effort due to boredom will serve as fixed predictors and participants' score of the Short Boredom Proneness Scale (SBPS), the Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II), and the Brief Self-Control Scale (BSCS) as covariates in different models. We will account for general differences between participants in tonic and phasic pupil Should our results, as hypothesized, show that pupil size as physiological indicator of effort is predicted more accurately when effort due to boredom is considered as predictor, we would characterize boredom as effortful. This would emphasize the importance of recognizing boredom as a confounding variable within self-control research and, more general, within the broader scope of study designs.</p><p>Conversely, if pupil size is not predicted by cognitive effort due to boredom, it could be argued that being bored during task performance might not Performing easy and hard tasks is not effortful on a physiological level.</p><p>Enduring boredom is not effortful on a physiological level.</p><p>size by including random intercepts and different effects of time on pupil size among participants by including random slopes for the variable time.

We will base our decision on the most optimal model regarding model fit and complexity on the BIC. trigger changes in this physiological correlate of effort. However, this outcome could even indicate a connection between boredom and low arousal levels, a correlation that remains ambiguous. In this case, the perceived effort elicited by boredom might be less influential on the pupillary activity than the possible decrease in arousal.</p><p>Research Question 3A:</p><p>Is task performance in a secondary task influenced by the level of difficulty (easy, hard) in the first task?</p><p>Given the inconsistent results in ego depletion research <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Giboin &amp; Wolff, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Hagger et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Hagger et al., 2010)</ref>, this research question will be tested exploratively.</p><p>We will conduct two paired t-tests. One t-test will analyze participants' error rate as dependent variable, while the other will focus on the reaction time.

Mental Fatigue Theories: Mental fatigue occurs after a period of prolonged differences in a prior mental task do not differentially carry over to performance on a secondary mental task. mental activity which leads to decrements in task performance. Research Question 3B: Can task performance in a secondary task be explained by the perceived amount of effort due to task difficulty invested in the first task? And does considering perceived boredom related effort in the first task provide a more accurate prediction of performance in the second task than considering task difficulty related effort alone? This research question will be tested exploratively. Three distinct LMMs will be tested for each performance variable in the flanker task (error rate, reaction time). The first model will assess the impact of the difficulty level (easy, hard; fixed effect) and the perception of effort due to task difficulty (fixed effect) in the Stroop task as well as the type of flanker trial (congruent, incongruent) on the reaction time in the flanker task while accounting for random effects among participants with random intercepts and random slopes. The second model will differ from the first by incorporating perceived boredom related effort as a fixed effect instead of perceived task difficulty related effort. The third model will include both perceived task difficulty and boredom related effort as fixed effects. If secondary task performance can be explained by task difficulty related effort in the preceding task: Subjectively investing effort due to the difficulty of a task reduces performance on a subsequent task. If secondary task performance can be explained more accurately by boredom related effort and task difficulty related effort together: Both the perception of a higher task difficulty related effort and boredom related effort in a first task, reduce performance in a subsequent task. Thus, performing boring as well as difficult tasks can lead to a worsened performance in a secondary task if effort (related to boredom or task difficulty) is perceived to be invested in the preceding task. Ego Depletion: Self-Control needed in a preceding task leads to less remaining selfcontrol for a secondary task which manifests in a worsened task performance. (Please note that even if a reduction in performance is observed, this would not constitute evidence for a depletion of a specific resource, as we do not measure such a resource in this research.) Mental Fatigue Theories: Mental fatigue occurs after a period of prolonged mental activity which leads to decrements in task performance.</p><p>The model with the lowest BIC will be considered as the most optimal one. Note: While our preregistered protocol states that we would include random slopes, we did not include them, as these would not be appropriate given the structure of the data (no within-subject variation in the predictors).</p><p>If performance in the secondary task cannot be explained by task difficulty or boredom related effort in a first task: Performance in a secondary is not impacted by the perceived amount of effort (either task difficulty or boredom related) invested in a preceding task.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Correlation Analysis</head><p>To elucidate the relationships between the key variables in our study, we conducted correlation analyses and presented them in a correlation table (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">5</ref>). Boredom, perceived task difficulty, effort due to boredom, effort due to difficulty, overall effort, and fatigue which were assessed with the thought probes were included in the analysis. Concerning the tasks, the error rate and the reaction time in the easy version and in the hard version of the Stroop task as well as the error rate and reaction time in the flanker task were integrated. Regarding the pupil size, the average tonic pupil size during the easy and during the hard version of the Stroop as well as the average phasic pupil size during the easy and hard version of the Stroop were encompassed. It should be noted that, although effort due to boredom and effort due to task difficulty were correlated when averaged across the entire Stroop task, variance inflation factors (VIF) indicated that multicollinearity was not problematic in our models predicting pupil size that included both variables. In model 3, which included the two effort variables, the VIFS for both variables were below 3 (tonic pupil size: VIF for effort due to difficulty = 2.75, VIF for effort due to boredom = 1.04; phasic pupil size: VIF for effort due to difficulty = 2.61, VIF for effort due to boredom = 1.09). In the exploratory version of model 3, which additionally included the interactions with task, the VIFS for both variables remained below 5 (tonic pupil size: VIF for effort due to difficulty = 4.64, VIF for effort due to boredom = 1.99; phasic pupil size: VIF for effort due to difficulty = 4.30, VIF for effort due to boredom = 2.12). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Explorative Analysis: Sweets</head><p>To assess whether boredom proneness affected the quantity of sweets participants took with them after completing the experiment, a multiple linear regression was conducted to predict the quantity of sweets taken predicted by boredom proneness while controlling for self-control and the Stroop tasks' difficulty level. The overall model was not significant, F(3,186) = 1.41, p = .242, and explained only a small proportion of variance in sweets quantity (R² = .022, adjusted R² = .006). None of the predictors were significant, neither the Stroop tasks' difficulty level (B = -0.04, β = -0.05, t = -0.33, p = 0.742), nor self-control (B = -0.13, β = -0.10, t = -1.09, p = 0.278), or boredom proneness (B = 0.04, β = 0.06, t = 0.58, p = 0.563). As the model assumptions of normality of the residuals and independence of errors were not met, a robust regression was conducted, leading to similar results regarding significance.</p><p>We further explored associations between our key variables and the quantity of sweets participants took with them by including this variable in our correlation analysis. The results indicated that participants' depression scores (r(93) = .22, p &lt; .05) and perceived task difficulty (r(93) = .30, p &lt; .01) were positively correlated with the number of sweets taken after the easy Stroop task. No significant correlations between the number of sweets and other variables were observed in the hard Stroop task.</p><p>Results suggest that there were either no alterations in the reward system of individuals with higher boredom proneness or the alterations did not manifest in the need for sweets after performing boring and effortful tasks. Instead, a significant relationship between BDI-scores and the amount of sweets taken after the easy Stroop was observed. This suggests that, for individuals with more symptoms of depression, boring activities might trigger reward-seeking behavior. However, various explanations are plausible, and further research is necessary to confirm this interpretation.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1Example of an Incongruent Trial of the Stroop Task (A) and of the Flanker Task(B)    </figDesc></figure>

One ANOVA analyzed participants' error rate as dependent variable, while the other focused on the reaction time.The ANOVA on error rates revealed significant effect of flanker congruency, F(1, 94) = 31.85, p &lt; .001, η² p = .25, indicating that participants made more errors in incongruent (M = 0.07, SD = 0.15) compared to congruent trials (M = 0.01, SD = 0.02; flanker effect). The main effect of preceding Stroop type (easy Stroop, hard Stroop), F(1, 94) = 1.29, p = .259, η² p = .01, and the interaction between preceding Stroop type and flanker congruency was not significant, F(1, 94) = 0.68, p = .412, η²p = .007, suggesting that the difficulty level of the Stroop did not impact error rates in the flanker task.Similar, the ANOVA on reaction times revealed a significant main effect of flanker 5 At Stage 2 of the manuscript, we added "repeated measures" to clearly indicate the type of ANOVA used. congruence, F(1, 94) = 107.61, p &lt; .001, η²ₚ = .53, indicating that participants required less time to respond in incongruent (M = 515.80, SD = 118.66) compared to congruent trials (M = 454.13, SD = 78.01). The main effect of preceding Stroop type (easy Stroop, hard Stroop), F(1, 94) = 1.21, p = .274, η²ₚ = .01, and the interaction between previous Stroop type and flanker congruence were not significant, F(1, 94) = 0.74, p = .393, η²ₚ = .008, suggesting that the difficulty of the previous Stroop task did not impact reaction times in the flanker task. The results are visualized with two bar charts (one showing the error rate, the other one showing the reaction time) providing the difficulty level on the x-axis, the error rate or the reaction time on the y-axis, and four differing bars (one for the easy Stroop version and congruent flanker trials, one for the easy Stroop version and incongruent flanker trials, one for the hard Stroop version and congruent flanker trials and one for the easy Stroop version and incongruent flanker trials).</figDesc></figure>

Participants' pupil sizes were measured during the task and served as an indicator for psychophysiological effort. It was tested if boredom and difficulty related effort predict tonic (baseline) and phasic (stimulus-evoked) pupil size during Stroop performance. Furthermore, this study investigated whether the Stroop task difficulty level as well as the perception of boredom and difficulty related effort in the Stroop task impacted performance in a secondary flanker task.Thought Probes: Temporal Dynamics Differ by Task TypeThe manipulation checks revealed that participants' error rates were lower, and reaction times were faster in the easy Stroop task. They reported greater overall boredom and perceived the easy Stroop as less difficult compared to the hard Stroop version. These findings confirm that our easy congruent Stroop version was indeed easier compared to our hard version.</figDesc></figure>

On the one hand, this may result in varying levels of required cognitive control throughout the task. On the other hand, task difficulty and difficulty related effort are impacted by a composite of cognitive processes rather than purely by Stroop interference. Similar designs incorporating switching components (e.g., changes in the proportion of congruent and incongruent trials) have been demonstrated to impact Stroop interference<ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Rothermund et al., 2022)</ref>, potentially affecting not only performance, but also pupillary reaction to the trial's demands as well as other psychological states measured in this study. This variability in cognitive control could have contributed to the non-significant relationship between difficulty related effort and pupil size in the present study. Future research will need to test whether the results generalize to other tasks, including Stroop tasks of intermediate difficulty without task-switching components and with various levels of congruency. Moreover, isolating distinct cognitive demands in different tasks would clarify the distinct contributions of each cognitive process to effort related to task difficulty and physiological responses, improving the interpretability of findings.</figDesc></figure>

Results show that perceived task difficulty is greater in the hard version (M = 4.98, SD = 2.54) compared to the easy version of color Stroop task (M = 2.54, SD = 1.97), t(209) = 13.34, p &lt; .01, d = 0.92. Boredom on the other hand is less pronounced in the hard (M = 5.01, SD = 2.79) than in the easy color Stroop (M = 5.90, SD = 2.67), t(209) = 4.91, p &lt; .01, d = 0.34.</figDesc></figure>

Our primary objective was to assess the participant's perception of task difficulty and boredom across the four tasks, thereby enabling us to select the most suitable Stroop task (color or numerical Stroop) for our present study and determining the appropriate sample size based on the effect size observed in our online study. The R code to reproduce analyses as well as the data set is available on OSF <ref type="url" target="https://osf.io/w9phy/">https://osf.io/w9phy/</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head><p>Data collection for all four sessions of our within-subjects design study was done online via CloudResearch's Connect platform. Participants were assigned to one out of two participation orders (order one: easy color, easy numerical, hard color, hard numerical; order two: hard color, hard numerical, easy color, easy numerical). The interval between sessions varied from one to seven days. After completing the tasks for ten minutes each, participants were asked to indicate how much they agree or disagree with statements about their experience during the task (boredom and perceived task difficulty).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>Starting with an initial cohort of 328 participants in session one, the study involved 210 participants (42.38 % female, 54.28 % male, 3.33 % other genders or no answer) who completed all four sessions of the study seriously (z-transformed error rate in the tasks less than three standard deviations away from the mean of all participants, attention checks answered correctly) and answered the relevant questions. The mean age of participants was 32.20 (SD = 5.31). Respondents were compensated with a fixed amount of $3.50 for their participation in each session.

In the case of the hard Stroop task, the average baseline pupil size was 788.07 (SD = 108.32), and the peak stimulus-evoked baseline corrected pupil size was 124.84 (SD = 23.96). The averages of thought probes are presented in table 1, the average tonic and phasic pupil size (averaged across the five trials preceding the thought probe) are shown in The premise that structurally more demanding tasks are also perceived as more difficult and yield lower performance scores.
