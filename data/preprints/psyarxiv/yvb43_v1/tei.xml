<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>There is currently no dedicated cognitive screen for chronic stroke survivors, with primary care and community settings currently using dementia tools which often do not take into account post-stroke impairments. We aimed to standardise, norm, and psychometrically validate the Mini-Oxford Cognitive Screen (Mini-OCS), a very brief (&lt;8 minute) cognitive screen for use in chronic stroke.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head><p>Data for 464 chronic stroke survivors on the OCS were analysed to determine the possibility of a short form. Theoretical and statistical choices were made to adapt the short form. The newly 'Mini-OCS' was then completed by 164 neurologically healthy controls (Mage = 68.66(SD=12.18), Myrs of education 15.40(SD=3.64), &amp; 61% Female), and 89 chronic stroke survivors (Mage = 69.86(SD=14.83), Myrs education = 14.29(SD=4.01), 45% Female,, Mdays since stroke = 597.02(SD=881.12), 79% ischaemic, 49% R hemisphere, &amp; Median NIHSS = 6.50(IQR=4-11)) . Additionally, we administered an extended neuropsychological battery and cognitive screening, as well as the Nottingham Extended Activities of Daily Living scale. We evaluated reliability and construct validity. <ref type="bibr">SCREEN 4</ref> Normative data for the Mini-OCS is provided and known-group discrimination demonstrates increased sensitivity in the memory and executive function domains compared to the OCS. The Mini-OCS further met all appropriate benchmarks for evidence of reliability and validity for each of the subtasks.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion and Conclusion</head><p>The Mini-OCS was developed as a standardised, stroke-specific cognitive screening tool with good psychometric properties for use in a chronic stroke population. The Mini-OCS is quick to administer and highlights cognitive strengths and weaknesses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Mini-Oxford Cognitive Screen (Mini-OCS): a very brief cognitive screen for use in chronic stroke</head><p>Stroke is a leading cause of disability and mortality globally <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2)</ref>, leading to high rates of cognitive impairment (&gt;85% of stroke survivors acutely after stroke, ~65% longer-term), though these estimates vary depending on the sample and measurements taken <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>. Global guidelines state that cognitive impairments should be sensitively screened for as soon as possible following stroke, including cognitive domain-specific impairments <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref>. Little attention has been paid to advise on routine cognitive screening long-term post-stroke (greater than 6-months post-stroke), despite the high rates of objective and subjectively reported cognitive impairment <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6)</ref> , and a recent systematic review demonstrating that the most frequent unmet care need in chronic stroke is managing cognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>.</p><p>However, consultations in primary care are time limited and existing tools may not always pick up or take into account post-stroke sequelae. This can lead to both under or overreporting of suspected cases of both dementia and cognitive impairment. Whilst the most frequently used cognitive screening tool is the Montreal Cognitive Assessment <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>, this screen was designed for dementia screening, with a focus on assessing impaired verbal memory as a key feature of Alzheimer's disease. This makes it less suitable for post-stroke cognitive impairment, which is often characterized by complex multi-domain cognitive impairments, resulting from a focal injury with a backdrop of degenerating brain health (see overview by <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>). The Oxford Cognitive Screen (OCS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref> was designed as a first-line multi-domain screening tool to determine the extent of focal cognitive deficits incurred by stroke.</p><p>Whilst the OCS has seen a wide take up in acute stroke-specific settings, its length (approx.. 20 min) and focus on acute deficits such as hemispatial neglect, apraxia, reading/writing impairments, as well as its inclusive nature (no penalties for using multiple choice responses in order to not unfairly penalise patients with aphasia), means it works well as a first line screening tool, but it is less sensitive at detecting domaingeneral deficits in memory and executive function <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>.</p><p>The OCS-Plus <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref> was designed as a highly sensitive test for these domain general impairments in memory and executive functioning; its longer duration and focus on milder deficits makes it a follow-up screening tool, mostly used in those with mild deficits. If sufficient time were available, a protocol of first-line cognitive screening with OCS, followed by screening for milder domain-general deficits with OCS-Plus might be a sensible suggestion, though practical and time constraints led us to conceive of the Mini-OCS.</p><p>We created a brief (less than 10 minutes) cognitive screening tool for chronic stroke survivors, which was developed following practical, theoretical, and statistical considerations, to reduce key barriers for uptake in primary care settings <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref>. The Mini-OCS is largely based upon the OCS <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref> with complex subtest elements taken from the OCS-Plus <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref>. The intention of the Mini-OCS is to quickly screen for cognitive impairments which are common post-stroke, and to be sensitive enough to detect mild cognitive impairments, in line with the complex cognitive picture encompassing domain-specific focal deficits due to the focal injury alongside potentially declining brain health resulting in domaingeneral cognitive difficulties. The Mini-OCS was designed to be inclusive for all stroke survivors, with tasks developed with consideration of visual acuity, hemi-spatial neglect, motor impairment, and dysphasia.</p><p>The current study presents the development of the Mini-OCS and psychometric validation using a cohort of stroke survivors and neurologically healthy ageing adults for normative reference. We examined the psychometric properties of test-retest reliability, construct validity, and known-group discrimination based upon newly generated normative data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Development: Methods</head><p>Our manuscript adheres to the COSMIN guideline for studies on measurement properties <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref> and the STROBE cohort checklist <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref>.</p><p>Ethical approval for the study was granted by the Medical Sciences Interdivisional Research Ethics Committee at the University of Oxford (REF: R86339/RE001).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Development of the Mini-OCS</head><p>Data for 464 participants who completed the full OCS at least 6 months post stroke were analysed to determine the possibility of a short form.</p><p>The data were part of the OCS-Recovery <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Milosevich et al 2023)</ref> and OCS-Care (Demeyere et al 2019) studies. This dataset was chosen as it fits the demographic of chronic stroke survivors and was available for use immediately.</p><p>We started with a core set of essential OCS subtasks which covered the main cognitive domains of the OCS. At the most minimal level, we aimed to include subtasks that adhered to international guidelines for cognitive screening in stroke.</p><p>In addition, we further theoretically organised several alternative minimal datasets with further subtasks. We selected the best model which fit statistical, theoretical, and practical criteria. Confirmatory Factor Analysis was used to assess unidimensionality of the OCS for subsequent analyses. Item response theory methods were chosen to establish discrimination and difficulty of each OCS subtask, to enable better selection of informative items. We then used an iterative approach to piloting the Mini-OCS, refining it, editing the Mini-OCS, and continuing to pilot it, before psychometric validation. We extensively detail the process in the supplementary materials.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CFA and IRT modelling</head><p>Twelve binary variables, indicating the impairment in the OCS subtasks, were included in a unidimensional confirmatory factor analysis model.</p><p>We used a factor loading cut off of &gt;.39 for inclusion in a factor <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20)</ref>.</p><p>Subsequently, a 2PL IRT model (discrimination and difficulty) was fit.</p><p>Two theta values (measurement of the underlying construct of the OCS tasks) were estimated for each participant: one based on the full form with all 12 subtasks, and one based on the proposed short form with the pre-selected tasks covering the different cognitive domains.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Development: Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CFA and IRT modelling</head><p>The unidimensional CFA model showed a good model fit (CFI: 0.981, RMSEA: 0.024). All factor loadings were significant and salient (above 0.40). No signs of local dependency were found. All subtasks of the OCS had discriminations above 1, and all subtasks had relatively high difficulty on average (mean difficulty= 1.95; SD= .44; range= 1.19 to 2.73). Using different numbers of subtests with the highest discriminations (the discrimination parameter indicates the overall information one can obtain from each subtest), one can observe a decreasing correlation between the estimated theta and the full-scale theta. With three subtests, the correlation is .72. With six subtests, the correlation is .85. Assuming this unidimensional structure, the results suggest that we could shorten the test by half without losing much precision.</p><p>Several models were found with sufficient correlations between the thetas, we report data from model 1 (r=.93) consisting of: orientation, number calculation, verbal memory, praxis , broken hearts, trails, sentence reading. See underlying code for additional information for each other model. Some tasks were replaced with more sensitive versions from OCS-Plus and the eventual Mini-OCS is composed of the following 9 subtasks; 1) orientation, 2) calculation, 3) word encoding and 4) recall (OCS-Plus), 5) meaningless gesture imitation, 6) shortened broken hearts test, 7) mixed trails (OCS-Plus), 8) delayed word recall (OCS-Plus), and 9) sentence reading. The broken hearts task has three metrics; a) total accuracy, b) object asymmetry (calculated as the number of right-gap hearts taken from the number of left-gap hearts), and c) space asymmetry (calculated as the number of correct hearts on the left four divisions of the stimuli sheet from the rightmost four divisions of the sheet.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theoretical and practical factors</head><p>To reduce time, multiple-choice options were only to be used if language and communication difficulties were present. To reduce materials, the instructions for the cancellation and trail making tasks moved onto the test sheet for reference. We further generated a short version of the broken hearts test which was developed with 30 hearts, rather than 50 target hearts. The shortened hearts task involved similar crowding of the remaining 90 hearts (30 targets, 60 distractors) on a vertically centred subsection of the page to keep the cognitive load whilst shortening administration. We also changed the shortened broken hearts test to have thicker lined hearts outlines, with an approximate visual acuity of 1.0 LogMAR equivalent at 30cm distance, to aid those with poorer visual acuity or lack of availability of their reading glasses. This lower visual acuity adaptation of the OCS broken hearts task was developed with orthoptic input as part of a separate project <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref>. Four pages per patient are required for the Mini-OCS: 1) examiner form, 2) mixed trails practice sheet, 3) the mixed trails test sheet, and 4) shortened broken hearts cancellation. In addition, a reusable test booklet contains a mixed trails demonstration page, large print sentence reading task page along with multiple-choice questions and answers for those with limited to no expressive speech.

Note, this reduced cut off was used in line with the recommended adjusted cut-off for stroke <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref>, and the inclusion of older adults where the original cut off may be too strict (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref>)</p><p>Exclusion criteria for both groups included sensory/perceptual/motor impairments that would prevent the ability to complete the tasks beyond reasonable adjustment (not inclusive of wheelchair/assistance use, which still allowed participants to complete the tasks). A priori power calculations indicated a minimum of 182 participants for the convergent/discriminant validity correlation analyses (alpha = .05/24 (where 24 = 12 Mini-OCS tasks analysed at least twice -Bonferroni correction), power = 90%, one sided, correlation &gt;.30).  <ref type="formula">29</ref>)) <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30)</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>In total, 164 neurologically healthy adults and 89 stroke survivors completed the Mini-OCS. All demographics are reported in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> and   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Psychometric evidence</head><p>Extensive psychometric evidence for the Mini-OCS is presented in supplementary materials; including reliability over time, by comparing a mixed sample (neurologically healthy ageing and stroke) on their first and retested Mini-OCS scores; convergent and discriminant validity against the MoCA as a reference standard for chronic stroke cognitive screening and against the construct and format matched neuropsychological battery, using correlational analyses in the full mixed sample. For test-retest reliability, we used ANCOVA analyses covarying for change in MoCA score as a reference standard for cognition across time and found no differences in Mini-OCS performance. When we examined the percentage of scores between test and retest that were identical, the percentages varied between tasks, but ranged from 39.13%</p><p>for broken hearts total score to 91.30% for orientation scores (M=65.61%, SD=19.19% -excluding time taken in seconds). For convergent validity, all Mini-OCS scores correlated with at least one comparison task per comparison (e.g., some metrics used more than one comparison task) above a pre-defined benchmark of r=.30, except broken hearts ego-and allo-centric neglect. For discriminant validity, none exceeded the benchmark of r=.30.</p><p>The model fit of the Mini-OCS total score was acceptable;</p><p>x 2 (41)=44.93, p=.31, CRI = .92, TLI = .89, RMSEA = .02, SRMR = .056, suggesting a unidimensional model fits the current data. The predicted factor scores are referred to as 'Mini-OCS total score' henceforth.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Normative data for Mini-OCS</head><p>We present normative data for the Mini-OCS taken from all neurologically healthy aging adults. The Mini-OCS took on average 7.33 minutes to complete (SD=1.63, range = 4-13minutes) by controls. We used 5 th centile cut offs for accuracy scores and 95 th centile cut offs for error scores in general, with the exception of executive function trails, cancellation accuracy, and time to complete, which use a 1.65 SD cut off, similar to previously used in the OCS-Plus <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref>. The normative data cutoffs are presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> and further stratified by age classification for further information. Age brackets were chosen by selecting the most equal segregation of age groups using the 'split' function in r. Finally, to aid interpretation of impairment on the Mini-OCS, we examined sample differences in Mini-OCS performance; the results are presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>.  <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">S3</ref>.</p><p>No age/education differences on Mini-OCS subtasks with a restricted range of outcome scores (e.g., orientation, number calculations, allo-and ego-centric neglect) reflect the qualitative rather than quantitative nature of interpretation of performance, with neurologically healthy adults performing at ceiling. Future studies are invited to continuously extend the norm data which will enable us to divide participants in more narrow age and education groups and define their cut-off values in a dynamically evolving normative base.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Psychometrics</head><p>For test-retest reliability we found great consistency between time points on Mini-OCS subtasks with no group differences found in performance.</p><p>We acknowledge that other methodologies of assessing test-retest reliability are superior such as intraclass correlation coefficients accounting for practice effects. However, the range of Mini-OCS tasks precluded the use of continuous variable analyses, thus ANCOVA was used to indicate test-retest stability.</p><p>We found evidence of convergent and discriminant validity, allowing us to conclude that the Mini-OCS is most likely to measure what it is intended to measure in each subtask. Though the correlations were not exceptionally high, it is not necessarily common practice for them to be in neuropsychological psychometrics <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">46)</ref>, and large correlations found in general psychology tend to be around r=.40 <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(47)</ref>.</p><p>There were some differences between associations of OCS and neuropsychological subtests. For instance, whilst the Mini-OCS orientation subtest was significantly associated with both MoCA orientation and OCS orientation subtests, Mini-OCS orientation was only associated with OCS orientation over the pre-defined benchmark of r=.30, which we suggest is down to the exact questions used being identical between tasks. Note here, even with identical questions asked on different tasks, the correlation between subtasks was only r=.45, which could be due to practice effects of realizing one makes a mistake and correcting for it in subsequent task -which subtask this affected was controlled for in counterbalancing, but it does not remove the effect.</p></div>
