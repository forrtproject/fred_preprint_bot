<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Motivated by the Scarr-Rowe hypothesis-which suggests that the expression of genetic potential depends on early-life conditions-this paper investigates how a genetic predisposition toward success in education interacts with the childhood environment to shape economic preferences. Using incentivized experimental data from a representative sample of English adults over the age of 50, we find that a higher genetic propensity for educational success is associated with lower risk aversion and greater patience-but only among those who experienced more advantaged childhood environments. Among participants who experienced an adverse early-life environment, risk aversion increases with genetic resources, whereas the positive relationship between genetic resources and patience is significantly attenuated. These findings suggest that early-life conditions can channel genetic resources in ways that are contextually adaptive. Concurrently, the results indicate that environmental inequality shapes the realization of genetic potential in ways that reinforce patterns of social immobility, thereby intensifying concerns regarding the systematic underutilization of potential arising from constraints on household resources.</p></div>

In this context, genetic predispositions are less predictive of cognitive outcomes in later life, potentially because high-SES (socioeconomic status) families may (consciously or unconsciously) offset their children's lower genetic While most gene-by-environment research has focused on the expression of genetic cognitive potential in cognitive phenotypes-such as cognitive ability and educational attainment-comparatively little attention has been paid to how this potential manifests in other traits where cognitive skills play a central role.

Furthermore, research in psychology and behavioural economics provides many channels through which cognitive skills influence decision-making under risk and over time. For instance, cognitive limitations can lead to narrow bracketing <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Abeler &amp; Marklein, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b106">Oberrauch &amp; Kaiser, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b120">Rabin &amp; Weizsäcker, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b154">Warsitzka et al., 2022)</ref>, where decisionmakers focus only on certain aspects of the consequences of a choice while ignoring others <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">(Read, Loewenstein &amp; Rabin, 1999)</ref>.

However, the literature has been unable to provide a consensus perspective. For instance, the life history theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">(Roff, 1992)</ref> suggests that early exposure to stress or scarcity leads to a 'fast' life strategy-prioritizing immediate rewards and risk-taking in response to environmental unpredictability-while stable environments encourage a 'slow' strategy, favoring future rewards and risk aversion <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Griskevicius et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Griskevicius et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b113">Pepper &amp; Nettle, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b146">Simpson et al., 2012)</ref>. In contrast, the uncertainty management perspective <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Amir &amp; Jordan, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Amir, Jordan &amp; Rand, 2018)</ref> sees early stress as a signal of future danger, shaping preferences that help manage uncertainty, such as impatience and risk aversion. Empirical evidence supports both accounts: early-life stress is consistently linked to impatience, while findings on risk preferences are mixed-predicting both greater risk-taking (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b146">Simpson et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b155">Wu et al., 2020)</ref> and greater risk aversion <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Amir, Jordan &amp; Rand, 2018</ref>). 2   2 The relationship between poverty and deprivation is complicated. For instance, risk-taking is often assumed to be a behavioural problem associated with low-income groups, but usually in regard to behaviours such as unsafe sexual practices, drug use, and problem gambling <ref type="bibr" target="#b138">(Sheehy-Skeffington &amp; Rea, 2017)</ref> as opposed to behaviours regarding occupational choice and important investment decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Caner &amp; Okten, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Eckel et al., 2012)</ref>. Further inconsistency comes from the contrasting perspectives on poverty leading to vulnerability to <ref type="bibr" target="#b145">Simonovic et al., 2017)</ref>. In a similar way, negative affect and anxiety can influence decisionmaking by inducing a generalized overestimation of risks <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Butler &amp; Mathews, 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b150">Stöber, 1997)</ref> and an attentional bias toward threatening information <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Gasper &amp; Clore, 1998)</ref>potentially attenuating or even blocking the behavioral expression of genetic propensities related to cognition.</p><p>Whereas the ECF focuses on how adverse environments suppress genetic expressionthereby limiting variability in traits-Adaptive Calibration Models (ACMs; Del <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Giudice et al., 2011)</ref> emphasize how biological systems (e.g., stress reactivity) are adaptively calibrated by early-life cues to prepare the individual for anticipated future environments. In this framework, genetic expression is not blocked, but rather channelled in ways that are contextually adaptive.</p><p>For instance, in advantaged environments, genetic resources may be calibrated toward longterm planning and opportunity recognition, while in disadvantaged environments, these same cognitive resources may be directed toward detecting environmental threats, uncertainty, and resource scarcity-leading to more conservative decision-making strategies that prioritize security <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Belsky &amp; Pluess, 2009)</ref>. Indeed, evidence suggests that early adversity can result in enhanced cue detection and greater physiological sensitivity to environmental challengesparticularly among individuals with higher processing capacities <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">(Obradović et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b107">Obradović, 2012)</ref>.

They are calculated as the sum of genome-wide genotypes-i.e., the combination of alleles across many loci-weighted by effect sizes (e.g., beta coefficients) derived from genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics. GWAS test hundreds of thousands of genetic variants, typically single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), to identify those statistically associated with a specific phenotype; in our case, educational attainment (EA).

This question has been used in previous research as a marker of more general future-orientation, or time perspective in financial behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Gladstone &amp; Hundtofte, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b114">Picone, Sloan &amp; Taylor, 2004</ref>) and is correlated with other established markers of time perspective, including smoking and body mass index (BMI; <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Adams &amp; Nettle, 2009)</ref>. Respondents can choose from seven possible answers, indicating planning timelines ranging from: 'does not plan/plans day to day'; 'the next few weeks'; 'the next few months'; 'the next year'; 'the next few years'; 'the next 5-10 years'; or 'longer than 10 years'. In addition to analyzing the full distribution of responses to the spending horizon question, we construct a binary indicator equal to one if the respondent's reported horizon extends beyond the next year, and zero otherwise. This threshold aligns with standard distinctions in the strategic management and financial planning literature between short-term and long-term financial planning.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.">Childhood Disadvantage</head><p>We take the approach in <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">Ronda et al. (2022)</ref> and consider childhood disadvantage over four dimensions. The first dimension is human capital disadvantage, which is measured as having neither parent with education above the compulsory level, which at the time (1918-1947) meant children had to stay in school until the age of 14 (49.84% of the experimental sample; 41.71% of the survey sample). The second dimension measured family resources and is measured using a question on the main carer's occupation when the respondent was aged 14. The classifications include armed forces; manager or senior official; running own business; professional or technical; administrative, clerical or secretarial; skilled trade; caring, leisure, travel or personal services; sales or customer service; plant, process or machine drivers; other jobs; something else; casual jobs; retired; unemployed; and lastly, sick / disabled. Family resource disadvantage was main carer's occupation falling into either of the following categories: plant, process or machine drivers; other jobs; something else; casual jobs; unemployed; and lastly, sick / disabled (27.56% of the experimental sample; 33.14% of the survey sample). Our third dimension is another measure of family resources disadvantaged, measured as growing up in a home with no central heating or hot water (23.72% of the experimental sample; 28.72% of the survey sample). The fourth dimension is a measure of family instability. We measured instability as parents being permanently separated or divorced before the respondent was aged 16, or having not lived with both natural parents for most of their childhood (15.22% of the experimental sample; 16.31% of the survey sample). In the experimental (survey) sample, 27.72% (28.45%) respondents experienced no dimension of disadvantage, 37.18% (35.88%) experienced one dimension of disadvantage, 27.08% (24.55) experienced two dimensions of disadvantage, 7.05% (9.59%) experienced three dimensions of disadvantage, and lastly, 0.96% (1.53%) experienced all four dimensions of disadvantage. Following Ronda et al. (2022) we categorize disadvantage as those respondents who experienced two or more dimensions of disadvantage, which corresponds to 35.10% (35.67%) of the experimental (survey) sample. It should also be noted that for the experimental (survey) sample 29.01% (25.06) respondents had a missing response to one of the four disadvantage dimensions, with 1.76% (16.51%) of respondents having a missing response to two of the four disadvantage dimensions. To maintain statistical power, we treat missing values as zero. 4</p></div>

For a full description of the cognitive tasks, see Section B of the Supplemental Material. In keeping with Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">2</ref>), we allow the parameters to differ across group 𝑔 and as a test of the Scarr-Rowe hypothesis, we compare the estimated genetic effects, 𝛼 𝑘 (𝑔). The results are presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref> (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref>), where 𝛽1 (𝛽1 + 𝛽2) is an estimate of the effect of the PGS EA on the dependent variable for the 'no disadvantage' ('disadvantage') group and 𝛽2 is the comparison of the estimated genetic effects, 𝛼 𝑘 (𝑔), between the 'no disadvantage' and 'disadvantage' groups.  The results illustrate that PGS EA is a strong predictor of educational attainment and, in line with the Scarr-Rowe hypothesis, is less predictive for those who experienced childhood disadvantage. However, the gene-by-environment interaction is only statistically significant for the survey sample. For cognitive ability, the predictive power of PGS EA is independent of the childhood environment. This supports previous research that the influence of the childhood environment, as a moderator for the heritability of cognitive factors, changes as people get older-with results showing the effect diminishes or disappears entirely at older ages <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Gottschling et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">Tucker-Drob &amp; Bates, 2016)</ref>. This is consistent with the observation that the importance of early environmental factors for explaining phenotypic variance decreases over time for most traits <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Briley &amp; Tucker-Drob, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b115">Plomin &amp; Daniels, 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b116">Plomin &amp; von Stumm, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b135">Segal &amp; Pratt-Thompson, 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr">Turkheimer, 2000)</ref>. Whilst the slope estimates are independent of childhood disadvantage, at every level of PGS EA those from backgrounds with childhood disadvantage have lower predicted cognitive ability. These relationships are illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref>, which plots the predict probability (score) for attainment of a university or college degree (cognitive ability), for each group 𝑔 across the PGS EA distribution.

Panel D (Regression 4, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref>).</p><p>We now turn our attention to Equation (3) and the influence of gene-by-environment interactions on the formation of economic preferences. In keeping with Equation (3), we allow the parameters to differ across group 𝑔 and as a direct test of the gene-by-environment interaction we compare the estimated genetic effects, 𝛼 𝑘 (𝑔). The results are presented in Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">5</ref> and <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">6</ref>, where 𝛽1 (𝛽1 + 𝛽2) is an estimate of the effect of the PGS EA on the dependent variable for the 'no disadvantage' (disadvantage) group and 𝛽2 is the comparison of the estimated genetic effects, 𝛼 𝑘 (𝑔), between the 'no disadvantage' and 'disadvantage' groups.</p><p>An alternative representation of the results contained in Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">5</ref> and <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">6</ref> is provided in Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref> and <ref type="figure">3</ref>, respectively, were we plot the predictions for each group for each level of standardized PGS EA.</p><p>Starting with Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">5</ref>, the estimated genetic effect operates in different direction for the 'no disadvantage' and 'disadvantage' groups. Specifically, for our 'no disadvantage' group the effect of PGS EA on risk aversion is negative and statistically significant-which is consistent with the literature on economic preferences and intelligence <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Dohmen et al., 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Dohmen et al., , 2018))</ref>whilst for our childhood disadvantage group the effect is always positive, and in Regressions 1 and 2, statistically significant at the 5% level. These effects are not small. For instance, from Regression 1 of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref>) we estimate the effects on our binary measure of the adapted B-EG lottery that includes losses, but controlling for the respondent's choice in the standard B-EG lottery. This allows us to test whether the effects in Regression 3 remain statistically significant after controlling for risk preferences, which are known to be conceptually related to, but distinct from, loss aversion <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Barberis et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b118">Rabin &amp; Thaler, 2001)</ref>. In short, the same pattern of results is revealed, suggesting that the gene-by-environment interaction exerts an independent effect on loss aversion, above and beyond the correlation with general risk tolerance. 6</p><p>6 The results are quantitively and qualitatively analogous when estimating Regression 2 of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">5</ref> whilst controlling for choices in the standard B-EG lottery. Note. Dashed (solid) lines are for the 'no disadvantage' ('disadvantage') group, Shaded areas represent 95% confidence intervals.

Panel C (Regression 3, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">5</ref>). Panel D (Regression 4, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">5</ref>).</p><p>Turning our attention to time preferences, the results in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">6</ref> suggest for our 'no disadvantage' group the effect of PGS EA on impatience is negative and statistically significant-which is consistent with the literature on time preferences and intelligence <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Dohmen et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b137">Shamosh &amp; Gray, 2008)</ref>. Again, these effects are not small. For instance, from Regression 1 of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">6</ref> (Panel A of Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>)-where our dependent variable reflects the weekly discount rate from the MPL where the larger-later rewards correspond to a time horizon of one month-and focusing on our 'no disadvantage' group, high-PGS EA respondents (+2 standard deviations from the mean) have a predicted weekly discount rate of -2.40% whilst the equivalent prediction for low-PGS EA respondents (-2 standard deviations from the mean) is 5.87%. The effects are comparable for the 'disadvantage' group, with the small difference between the groups not being statistically significant. Turning to Regression 2 of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">6</ref> (Panel B of Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>)-where our dependent variable reflects the weekly discount rate from the MPL where the larger-later rewards correspond to a time horizon of two months-the effect of PGS EA on the discount rate for our 'no disadvantage' group is again negative and statistically significant. However, the predictive effect is smaller for the 'disadvantage' group, although the difference is marginally statistically insignificant. Here, the longer delay in the future period (Regression 2 of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">6</ref>) may have improved our ability to measure respondents' impatience. This is consistent with established evidence from the intertemporal choice literature, whereby longer delays tend to amplify impulsivity and present bias, making individuals more likely to choose the smaller-sooner reward <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Frederick, Loewenstein, &amp; O'Donoghue, 2002)</ref>. This pattern aligns with the principles of hyperbolic discounting, which suggest that people disproportionately devalue rewards as the delay increases <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">(Laibson, 1997</ref>). 7</p><p>7 We also estimate Regression 2 of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">6</ref>, controlling for the respondents' discount rate over a 1-month delay. This estimation strategy allows us to estimate the degree to which respondents are disproportionately impacted by longer delays. The effect for the 'no disadvantage' group suggests that a higher PGS EA lowers present-bias (𝑏 = -0.006, 𝑡 = -2.41, 𝑝 = 0.016) whilst for the 'disadvantage' group the effect was positive (𝑏 = 0.004, 𝑡 = The results are more definitive when we turn our attention to Regressions 3 and 4 of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">6</ref>, which utilize the survey-based question on planning horizons. For instance, when turning to Regression 3 (Panel C of Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>)-where our dependent variable is the ordinal variable of planning horizon-focusing on the 'no disadvantage' group, high-PGS EA respondents (+2 standard deviations from the mean) have a predicted probability of reporting a planning horizon of 'longer than 10 years' of 10.48% whilst the equivalent predicted probability for low-PGS EA respondents (-2 standard deviations from the mean) is 5.05%. For our 'disadvantage' group, high-PGS EA respondents have a predicted probability of reporting a planning horizon of 'longer than 10 years' of 6.70% whilst low-PGS EA respondents have a predicted probability of 5.19%. Equivalently, focusing on our 'no disadvantage' group, the predicted probabilities of reporting a planning horizon of 'does not plan/plans day to day' for high-PGS EA respondents is 6.3%, and 9.43% for low-PGS EA respondents. For our 'disadvantage' group, the corresponding estimates are 12.82% and 11.99%, respectively.</p><p>Lastly, and consistently from Regression 4 of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">6</ref> (Panel D of Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>), focusing on our 'no disadvantage' group, the predicted probability of reporting a long-term planning horizon (i.e., that their planning horizon extends beyond the next year) is 60.11% for high-PGS EA respondents and 41.42% for low-PGS EA respondents. For our 'disadvantage' group the effects operate in the same direction, but the effect is smaller than for the 'no disadvantage' group. Furthermore, in both Regressions 3 and 4 of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">6</ref>, the comparison of the estimated genetic effects, 𝛼 𝑘 (𝑔), between the 'no disadvantage' and 'disadvantage' groups is negative and statistically significant. In summary, childhood disadvantage tends to attenuate the relationship between genetic potential and time preferences, meaning that no matter the genetic cognitive potential, childhood disadvantage leads to behaviour that is relatively myopic. This is consistent with both the life history theory and the uncertainty management perspective, that is, prioritizing immediate rewards in response to environmental unpredictability and to manage uncertainty.</p></div>

For instance, as illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>-which shows the distribution of the PGS EA scores separately for each group-individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds have PGS EA scores that are 0.097 standard deviations lower than the overall sample mean in the experimental sample, and 0.101 standard deviations lower in the survey sample. This observed gap is expected, as individuals inherit their genetic makeup from their parents, whose own genetic traits influence their educational attainment, occupational status, and acquisition of resources.</p><p>In our setting, if there are other childhood environmental factors correlated with respondents' PGS EA-such as parenting practices-that are also associated with respondents' economic preferences, then our between-family model will fail to separate the effects of parental genes on offspring economic preferences from the offspring's own genetic endowment. To address this possibility, we re-estimate Equation (3) and replicate Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">5</ref> and <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">6</ref> including the Parental Bonding Instrument (PBI; <ref type="bibr" target="#b127">Roe &amp; Siegelman, 1963;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b133">Schaefer, 1965)</ref>, which measures respondents' retrospective experiences of their parents' parenting style before age 16. The PBI focuses on parental care and overprotection, consisting of 14-items (7 for each parent) including "She/he let me do the things I liked doing"; "She/he made me feel I was not</p><p>wanted" [reverse-coded]; and "She/he liked me to make my own decisions"; all on 1 ("strongly disagree") to 4 ("strongly agree") scales. We use the average score across items, where internal consistency reliability across the 14-items was good (𝛼 = 0.85; average interitem correlation of 0.15). For non-responders (227 individuals in the experimental sample and 2,025 individuals in the survey sample) we code missing values as zero and including a separate dichotomous control indicator for missingness (i.e., the missing indicator method). Although the relationship between PGS EA and PBI is positive, the correlation is small and statistically insignificant for our experimental sample (𝑟 = 0.023, 𝑝 = 0.568) and small and statistically significant for our survey sample (𝑟 = 0.054, 𝑝 &lt; 0.001). More importantly, the inclusion of PBI in the estimation of Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">3</ref>) leads to results that are quantitively and qualitatively similar to those presented in the main text (see Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">S10</ref> and <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">S11</ref> in Section A of the Supplemental Material). Note. Panel A: experimental sample of 624 individuals (219 'disadvantage' and 405 'no disadvantage' individuals), 𝑝 = 0.078 (t-test), 𝑝 = 0.132 (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test).

To start, we focus on genetic variants associated with personality, given that polygenic scores for personality traits are correlated with PGS EA <ref type="bibr" target="#b148">(Smith-Woolley, Selzam &amp; Plomin, 2019)</ref>. Importantly, personality traits have also been shown to influence risk-taking <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">(Lauriola &amp; Levin, 2001)</ref> and time preferences <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">(Keidel et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Manning, 2014)</ref>. To this end, we re-estimate Equation (3) and replicate Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">5</ref> and <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">6</ref> with the inclusion of polygenic scores for the Big Five personality traits. 8 The results, presented in Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">S12</ref> and <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">S13</ref> in Section A of the Supplemental Material, are nearly identical to those reported in the main text.</p><p>Additionally, Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">S14</ref> and <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">S15</ref> report the correlations between polygenic scores for personality traits and the PGS for educational attainment, for both the experimental and survey samples. Next, we re-estimate Equation (3) and replicate Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">5</ref> and <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">6</ref>, but replace the polygenic score for educational attainment (PGS EA) with the polygenic score for IQ (PGS IQ). Our PGS IQ is derived from the large-scale GWAS meta-analysis conducted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b131">Savage et al. (2018)</ref>, which focuses specifically on fluid cognitive ability-defined as an individual's capacity to process and integrate information, act, and solve novel problems. In contrast, PGS EA captures a broader set of cognitive traits associated with educational achievement <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">(Lee et al., 2018)</ref>. Importantly, PGS EA benefits from substantially larger and more statistically powerful GWAS datasets compared to those available for IQ, which translates into higher predictive accuracy in independent samples <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Dudbridge, 2013)</ref>. The smaller discovery sample for PGS IQ results in lower SNP-heritability capture and reduced statistical power, making it a less precise proxy for genetic influences on cognitive functioning. Despite these limitations, our re-analysis using PGS IQ (see Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">S16</ref> and <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">S17</ref> in Section A of the Supplemental Material) yields results that are qualitatively similar to those reported in the main text, reinforcing the robustness of our findings.

This approach, despite offering clearer attribution to cognitive ability, is however more susceptible to socio-economic and lifestyle confounders.

(2010)</ref>, we investigate whether the estimated genetic effects are indirect-operating through the channels of income, wealth, and education to influence economic preferences. Higher wealth and income may affect preferences by lowering the tangible and psychological costs of negative income shocks from risk-taking, or by reducing the need for immediate payoffs. Similarly, education may increase financial knowledge, which could help individuals better understand and evaluate probabilities and outcomes.

In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">S20</ref>, which focuses on risk preferences, we see that the coefficients are almost identical to those results presented in the main text. In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">S21</ref>, which focuses on time preferences, we see there is a large reduction in the (absolute) value of the coefficients relating impatience and the PGS for educational attainment, although for our survey-based planning horizon measure, the coefficients of interest remain statistically significant at the 10% level or better. Taken together, the contrasting influences of genetic effects related to educational success on economic preferences in our 'no disadvantage' and 'disadvantage' groups do not operate solely through these indirect channels.</p></div>

For instance, respondents with a low polygenic score for educational attainment who experienced childhood disadvantage have lower levels of education, lower cognitive ability, are less risk-averse, and less patient than their genetically equivalent counterparts from more advantaged childhood environments. This combination of mental process and internal preferences are important for addictive behaviors such as smoking and gambling, which combine intertemporal elements with risk considerations <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">(Ida and Goto 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b152">Sutter, Kocher, Glätzle-Rützler &amp; Trautmann, 2013)</ref>.

When childhood disadvantage is combined with high genetic potential, the story is equally discouraging. Here, higher levels of educational attainment and phenotypic cognitive skills, are coupled with more risk-aversion and less patience than their genetically equivalent counterparts from more advantaged childhood environments. Whilst it may be advantageous to couple low cognitive skills with cautious tendencies <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Dohmen et al., 2010)</ref>, optimal investment decisions likely require a combination of a willingness to take calculated risks and high cognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Grinblatt, Keloharju &amp; Linnainmaa, 2011</ref><ref type="bibr">, 2012)</ref>. Taken together, disadvantaged environments appear to limit the ability of individuals to capitalize on genetic potential, suggesting that environmental inequality can reinforce patterns of social immobility. These findings also underscore the limitations of genetic determinism, illustrating how genetic predispositions are not fixed but interact dynamically with environmental factors, reinforcing the importance of nurturing environments for maximizing potential and policies to reduce childhood poverty. Indeed, findings from childhood intervention programs, illustrate that enriching early environments raises noncognitive skills that promote success in social and economic life <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Borghans et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Cunha et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Heckman et al., 2010)</ref>.</p><p>The results also provide an opening for new perspectives on the mechanisms through which gene-by-environment interactions shape economic preferences.

Additionally, the finding that individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds exhibit similarly short-term (impatient) planning horizons across all PGS EA levels suggests that early adversity may impose pervasive constraints-such as scarcity-driven cognitive load or learned present-biased behaviors-that limit the expression of cognitive potential in decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">(Mani et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b129">Rutter, 2006)</ref>.

In contrast, in more advantaged childhood environments, the absence of such scarcity constraints appears to allow individuals with higher PGS EA to express economic preferences that are more aligned with findings from the cognitive ability literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Dohmen et al., 2010)</ref>.

The first perspective comes from the life history approach from evolutionary biology <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">(Roff, 1992)</ref> whereby early-life experience, such as exposure to stress or resource scarcity, can shape and individual life history strategy and their preferences for risk and time. Here, individuals who perceive their environment as more uncertain and unpredictable may be likely to adopt a 'fast' life strategy, which prioritizes rapid reproduction and survival in unpredictable environment-associated with higher risk-taking and focus on immediate rewards-whilst a 'slow' strategy focuses on long-term survival and reproduction in stable environments-associated with a higher value placed on future rewards and more risk aversion. A contrasting view comes from the uncertainty management perspective <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Amir &amp; Jordan, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Amir, Jordan &amp; Rand, 2018)</ref> where early-life stress predicts a dangerous future environment, shaping economic preferences in a way that facilitates the management of uncertainty.

For instance, economic preferences like impatience may shape cognitive investments (e.g., through investments in education). Alternatively, cognitive ability may affect economic preferences, perhaps because cognition governs the degree to which the emotional system, System 1-risk averse and myopic-can be overridden by the deliberative system, System 2-risk neutral and patient <ref type="bibr" target="#b149">(Stanovich &amp; West, 2008)</ref>. Moreover, the level of cognitive skills and economic preferences could conceivably be set simultaneously, perhaps because evolutionary pressures might have created a tendency for low cognitive skills to be coupled with cautious tendencies <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Dohmen et al., 2010)</ref>. Whilst our results cannot be interpreted as causal, given that genotypes are randomly assigned from parents to an offspring at conception, the estimated effect of the PGS for educational attainment should be unsusceptible to the problem of reverse causality <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">(Madole &amp; Harden, 2023)</ref> and less susceptible to socio-economic and life-style confounders <ref type="bibr" target="#b147">(Smith et al., 2007)</ref>. To address causality, future work can extend our analysis by leveraging within-sibling variation in polygenic scores or by controlling for the genes of the respondent's natal parents.</p><p>A further limitation of our study is that the polygenic score for educational attainment (PGS EA) captures not only genetic influences related to cognitive ability, but also overlaps with non-cognitive traits, such as personality. This conflation raises concerns about whether observed associations attributed to cognitive factors may, in fact, reflect other psychological or behavioral dispositions. In our analysis, we do control for genetic variants associated with the Big Five personality traits. We also replicate our main findings using both the polygenic score for IQ and phenotypic IQ.

Therefore, responses to the MPL tasks allow us to infer the upper and lower bounds of participants discount rate over different time horizons, which we use directly in the formal empirical analysis. Respondents who have unusually high (low) discount rates may not switch, instead accepting Option A (B) in all Payoff Alternatives. For these respondents the bounds of the inferred weekly discount rate are less precise. Lastly, there are a number of inconsistent subjects in our sample-those who for instance, after having chosen Option B in Payoff Alternative 5, switched back to Option A in Payoff Alternative 6.</figDesc></figure>
