<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Well-being has been the focus of investigation in psychological sciences in recent years, yet cross-sectional and group-level methods fall short of capturing the dynamics of person-level well-being experiences in daily life. This investigation is particularly important for young adults who are in a developmental phase in which they experience unique fluctuations in their daily life. In the present study we used ecological momentary assessments of well-being from two samples of first-year college students (Sample 1, N = 103, assessments = 2,535; Sample 2, N = 76, assessments = 1,796) and dynamic exploratory graph analysis to address the following research questions: (1) How do elements of well-being in young adults' daily life form a dynamic network? (2) Does the well-being dynamic network structure hold across all young adults, or is there heterogeneity in those structures? (3) Is there synchrony among well-being elements, and do they drive a person's well-being network? Findings from this study suggest that while group-level dynamic well-being networks align with theoretical models, young adults' individual experiences vary significantly, with each person demonstrating unique well-being network structures and synchronous elements. These findings underscore the importance of considering individual variability in well-being networks, highlighting the necessity for personalized approaches in understanding and promoting well-being among young adults.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Furthermore, young adults in college are more likely to face irregularities and fluctuations in their day-to-day life, participating in risk-taking behaviors, frequent social gatherings, and often irregular work schedules <ref type="bibr">(Finlay et al., 2012)</ref>. For instance, prioritizing social events and leisure over activities like volunteering or spiritual practices can lead to behaviors such as excessive drinking and disruptive conduct, which negatively affect sleep patterns and overall daily structure <ref type="bibr">(Carney et al., 2006)</ref>. Given these dynamic experiences, adopting a multidimensional approach to well-being that captures these daily variations can provide a deeper understanding of this critical transition phase into adulthood.</p><p>PERMA, a multidimensional framework of well-being introduced by <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Seligman (2011)</ref>, explains well-being through five hedonic and eudaimonic elements: Positive emotions, Engagement, Relationships, Meaning, and Accomplishment. It has been argued that while these elements are not an exhaustive list of factors that make up a person's experience of well-being in life, they (1) "can be defined and measured independently of other elements while being interconnected (connectivity)," and (2) "people pursue each element for its own sake and not just to serve another element (exclusivity)" <ref type="bibr">(Seligman, 2018, p. 2)</ref>. By adopting a network approach, previous research <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Heshmati et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Merritt et al., 2024)</ref> has validated the assumptions of 'exclusivity' and 'connectivity' in young adults' PERMA well-being network <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Seligman, 2018)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>NETWORK DYNAMICS OF WELL-BEING 10</head><p>In parallel, the science of well-being is shifting toward a dynamical systems perspective, moving beyond theoretical frameworks that view wellbeing as a fixed trait <ref type="bibr">(Heshmati, et al., 2024a)</ref>. This shift challenges the concept of an "ideal," and unchanging state of well-being and mental health as a stable endpoint <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Busseri &amp; Sadava, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Biswas-Diener et al., 2011)</ref>. A dynamical systems approach emphasizes the fluid and evolving nature of well-being, highlighting its process-oriented characteristic that cultivates stable traits over time. Further, it enables an examination of how well-being changes over short and long time-scales, the variability among individuals, and their impact on a person's overall journey toward well-being <ref type="bibr">(Heshmati, et al., 2024a)</ref>.</p><p>There is an emerging consensus on the necessity of idiographic, person-centered approaches in psychological science <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Molenaar, 2004)</ref>. The prevailing use of nomothetic approaches in psychological research, which seek to establish general laws and commonalities across individuals, are insufficient to explain individual-level experiences. These methods presuppose that psychological traits and dynamics, such as those associated with well-being, are consistent across people (i.e., ergodicity; Nesselroade <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">&amp; Molenaar, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr">Fisher et al., 2018)</ref> with a growing body of research highlighting the limitations of this assumption <ref type="bibr">(Hayes &amp; Hofmann, 2021)</ref>.</p><p>For instance, although group-level analyses might identify common dimensions of personality across a population, individual-level analysis reveals a much broader spectrum of personal characteristics that vary not NETWORK DYNAMICS OF  only in number but also in kind <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Beck &amp; Jackson, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Borkenau &amp; Ostendorf, 1998)</ref>. This distinction is crucial in the study of well-being in young adults, where heterogeneity in personal significance and the subjective nature of well-being processes play pivotal roles <ref type="bibr">(Heshmati, et al., 2023)</ref>. Idiographic approaches allow researchers to delve into the unique configurations of well-being elements for each individual, acknowledging that the interrelations among these elements can differ dramatically from person to person.</p><p>Dynamic network models are one method that can investigate how the components and the whole of well-being relate across time. In a network, each component (e.g., item) of well-being is represented as a 'node' (circle)</p><p>with 'edges' (lines) that connect each component. The edges represent how two components change together across time given all other components.</p><p>Components that consistently change together can form strong interconnections known as 'communities', which are consistent with dimensions of a construct <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Golino et al., 2020)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>This representation is afforded by Dynamic Exploratory Graph</head><p>Analysis (DynEGA; <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Golino, et al., 2022)</ref>. DynEGA estimates the first-order derivatives of each variable's time series for each person using the Generalized Local Linear Approximation method <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Deboeck et al., 2009)</ref> to capture their rate of change (i.e., how quickly a variable increases and decreases) across a time window of consecutive measurement points (e.g., NETWORK DYNAMICS OF WELL-BEING 12 five). Afterwards, networks and communities are estimated from these derivatives for each person and the sample. Similarities and differences between the individual-level and samplelevel as well as pairwise individual-level structures can be examined at various degrees. At the broadest structure, networks can be compared to examine how similar individuals are to each other and the sample. At the intermediate structure, communities can be compared to determine whether dimensions are similar (even if the networks appear different). At the lowest structure, centrality measures can be compared to determine how similar nodes are connected within the networks. Taken together, these comparisons provide evidence for whether the dynamics of well-being are homogeneous across the sample.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Present Research</head><p>In the present investigation, we aimed to explore well-being in firstyear college students as a dynamic network, characterized by temporal momentary changes and individual variability through an ecological momentary assessment (EMA; <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Stone &amp; Shiffman, 2002)</ref> research design.</p><p>This period of young adulthood, especially the transition to college, is marked by significant fluctuations in daily routines and social activities, making it a critical phase for examining well-being. We posit that applying dynamic network analysis to well-being in young adults will enhance our understanding of its underlying structures and driving elements. This approach aligns with the shift in psychological sciences toward more NETWORK DYNAMICS OF WELL-BEING 13 nuanced and process-oriented understandings of mental health and wellbeing <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Hayes &amp; Hoffman, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr">Heshmati, et al., 2024b)</ref>, recognizing that static and nomothetic models do not adequately capture the complexity of human experiences <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Renner et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>In prior well-being research, investigations have often concentrated on general trends and commonalities across people, potentially overlooking the intricacies of individual experiences of well-being in daily life. Our study aims to address this gap by testing whether (a) components that make up young adults' well-being experiences across time form the same theoretical dimensions of well-being as proposed by the PERMA framework, (b) wellbeing network, dimension, and centrality structures are similar at the sample-and individual-level, and (c) some well-being elements are more synchronous (change together more consistently) across time and that these patterns are consistent across individuals. By focusing on first-year college students, we aim to capture the unique and dynamic nature of well-being during this critical transition period for young adults. Method Participants and Procedures The first sample comprised 103 first-year college students enrolled at one of five undergraduate Claremont Colleges aged 18 to 20 years old (M = 18.41, SD = 0.57). Participants in this sample were from a larger multiweek intervention study across multiple semester cohorts (e.g., Fall 2021, period (before any intervention was applied). Participants completed EMAs at semi-random time points within four blocks (9:00-11:00 a.m., 2:00-2:00 p.m., 3:00-5:00 p.m., 6:00-9:00 p.m.) and no two surveys were administered within one hour of each other. The EMAs were signaled four times each day for 1 week. Out of a total of 2,884 possible EMAs (103 people 7 days 4 signals), this sample had 2,535 available EMAs to analyze (sample compliance rate = 88%), with participants completing an average of 24 (SD = 3) out of the 28 signaled surveys (individual compliance rate = 86%). The compliance rate for this sample was acceptable (above 80%), according to EMA guidelines by Stone and Shiffman (2002). The second sample comprised 76 first-year Claremont College their survey response rates, with a maximum payment of $30 for trait measures and one week of EMAs.

To emphasize that participants were answering questions about their momentary well-being, participants were prompted with the phrase "in this current moment," and phrases such as "in general"</p><p>were removed (see <ref type="bibr">Heshmati et al., 2023)</ref>. There were three items based on each block of PERMA for a total of 15 items: Positive emotions (e.g., "I am feeling joyful"), Engagement (e.g., "When I noticed this survey, I was absorbed in what I was doing"), Relationships (e.g., "I feel helped and supported by others"), Meaning (e.g., "I have a sense of direction in my life"), and Accomplishment (e.g., "I am making progress towards accomplishing my goals''). Each item was presented in a randomized order on participants' smartphones to reduce biased responses due to order effects. For each item, participants used a slider scale that ranged from 0</p><p>(not at all) to 100 (completely).</p></div>

To estimate a network, the graphical least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (GLASSO; Friedman et al., 2008) with extended Bayesian information criterion (EBIC; Epskamp &amp; Fried, 2018) was used. To estimate the number and content of dimensions, the lower-order Louvain algorithm (Blondel et al., 2008) was applied.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Network, Dimension, and Node Similarity</head><p>To evaluate the similarity of sample-to-individual level and pairwise individual-level networks, we used an information-theoretic metric called Jensen-Shannon Distance (JSD; De <ref type="bibr">Dominico et al., 2015)</ref>.

The ARI quantifies the similarity between two community solutions by counting the matching pairs and accounting for the expected number of matching pairs by chance. Values can range from -1 (completely different) to 1 (exactly the same) with zero representing similarity expected by random chance. ARI was computed between the sample-and individual-level dimensions to determine the representativeness of the sample-level dimensions. A permutation test was performed to determine whether the ARI value was significantly different from zero <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Qannari et al., 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Centrality similarity used node strength (absolute sum of a node's connections to other nodes), which was compared between sample-toindividual level and pairwise individual-level networks. Node strength is commonly used in network psychometrics and is often referenced as "centralness" in terms of rank order <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bringmann et al., 2019)</ref>. Consistent with this usage, comparisons used Spearman's correlation to determine the similarity of centrality.</p></div>

On the one hand, the individual-level dimensions appear to be relatively consistent with the sample-level dimensions given the median number of dimensions was 5 across individuals and the majority (more than 50%) of individuals had 5 dimensions in both samples (but not necessarily the same content). On the other hand, there was still a good proportion (at least 40%)</p><p>of the sample that did not have the same number of dimensions as the sample-level.

The individuals whose communities had the highest, median, and lowest values of ARI with their respective sample-level communities are displayed in Figure 3. In Sample 1, the highest (ARI = 0.811) and median (ARI = 0.236) similarities were significantly different (p &lt; 0.001 and p = 0.010, respectively) than would be expected from random (ARI = 0). The lowest (ARI = -0.174) similarity did not significantly differ (p = 0.901) from random. Similarly, in Sample 2, the highest (ARI = 0.811) and median (ARI = 0.174) similarities were significantly different (p &lt; 0.001 and p = 0.029, respectively) than would be expected from random and the lowest (ARI = -0.174) similarity did not significantly differ (p = 0.902) from random. Across individuals in Sample 1, thirty-seven (35.9% of the sample) had similarities with their respective sample-level communities that were not significantly different from random. Across individuals in Sample 2, thirty (39.5% of the sample) had similarities with their respective sample-level communities that were not significantly different from random.

Four out of five possible variable pairs that were identified as synchronous were found in both samples and were similarly some of the most frequently identified variable pairs at the individual-level (E1-E3, A1-A3, P1-P2, A1-A2). The majority of the most frequently identified synchronous variable pairs at the individual level for both samples were variables that belonged to the same theoretical P, E, or A dimension at the sample-level. This result is not surprising as these variables were crafted to represent the same underlying construct.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>NETWORK DYNAMICS OF WELL-BEING 27</head><p>There were, however, several variable pairs that were not in the same dimension at the sample-level that were synchronous for a few individuals.</p><p>These different sample-level dimension variable pairs reflect the relative unique processes of each person's well-being and support the different network and dimension structures reported earlier. In sum, there were several synchronous variable pairs across many people but the majority of pairs were identified in 10% or less individuals suggesting heterogeneous processes across individuals. Note. Frequencies of the number of individuals with variable pairs reaching synchrony (wTO &gt; 0.25) in Sample 1 (top) and Sample 2 (bottom). The bar </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary</head><p>Broadly, there is consistency at the sample-level in network structure, dimensionality, and centrality across both samples. At the individual-level, this consistency turns to heterogeneity for the between sample-and individual-level structures as well as pairwise similarities between individuals across network structure, dimensionality, and centrality. The distributions of the similarities of the network structure and centrality, however, did not significantly differ. These individual-level results support the conclusion that there is consistency of heterogeneity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>We investigated how elements of well-being, as experienced in daily life by first-year young adult college students, form dynamic networks, examining both sample-level trends and individual-level patterns. Using a multidimensional perspective of well-being, theorized to be made up of various dimensions that form a web of well-being <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Merritt et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Seligman, 2018)</ref>, we implemented a dynamic psychometric network approach to examine how well-being changes as a system over time. From this analysis, several key conclusions emerged.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>NETWORK DYNAMICS OF WELL-BEING 29</head><p>First, the structure of well-being was visualized and analyzed over time at both sample and individual levels, revealing how well-being elements theorized in the PERMA model form dynamic networks. At the sample-level, our analysis focused on identifying common patterns and structures within the well-being networks across the entire sample and replicated in a second sample. We observed that all items (nodes)</p><p>measuring the same construct were highly correlated with each other and formed the P, E, R, M, A communities, while also remaining connected to other nodes in the network but on a weaker level. We also found similar results when assessing centrality in the sample-level networks. Across the two first-year college student samples, we found that the Positive emotions nodes were most central (highly connected to other nodes) in the sample networks, consistent with previous findings using single time points <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Heshmati et al., 2022)</ref>.</p><p>At the individual-level, we examined whether these sample-level findings held true at the individual-level. The individual-level results highlighted the fluid nature of well-being experiences in first-year college students, where the strength and nature of interactions between elements as experienced in daily life, could fluctuate based on personal life circumstances and individual characteristics. In fact, we found that although around 50% of individuals' well-being networks had five communities, at least 40% of the individuals in both samples did not have the same number of communities as the sample-level.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>NETWORK DYNAMICS OF WELL-BEING 30</head><p>Second, our results demonstrated that while nodes that were theorized to be measuring the same well-being element were highly synchronized across people, there was considerable variability in how wellbeing elements are synchronized among individuals in both samples. This variability in synchronization reveals that the dynamics between well-being elements are not uniformly experienced across all young adults. One For young adults, especially those transitioning to college, our findings-replicated in two studies-have significant implications. This developmental period accompanied by a drastic change in environment and lifestyle for those transitioning to college, is marked by substantial changes in daily routines, social interactions, and responsibilities, which can lead to fluctuations in well-being <ref type="bibr">(Rombaoa et al., 2023</ref>). First-year college students face unique challenges, including adapting to a new academic environment, establishing new social connections, and often living away from home for the first time. These changes can result in heightened stress, homesickness, and a sense of uncertainty. Additionally, the demands of academic performance, time management, and navigating new social dynamics can create a complex and often overwhelming experience. Recognizing that each student's well-being network is unique allows for the development of targeted strategies that consider individual differences in experiences and needs. For example, some students might benefit from interventions that emphasize positive emotions and engagement in enjoyable activities, while NETWORK DYNAMICS OF WELL-BEING 32 others might need support in building strong relationships or finding purpose in their academic and personal lives. By tailoring interventions to the specific dynamics of each student's well-being network, we can promote better mental health and overall well-being, helping first-year college</p><p>students navigate this important transition with greater ease and success.</p><p>This variability also underscores the importance of developing a deeper understanding of the mechanisms that drive these differences. There is a need for dynamic models that can more accurately reflect the fluid and evolving nature of well-being, which would ideally incorporate methods that capture these fluctuations over time and adapt to individual differences.</p><p>More recently, theoretical perspectives and methodological approaches centered on capturing individual differences in well-being dynamics (e.g., GoHiAR; <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Li et al. 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr">Heshmati et al., 2024a)</ref> are on the rise, and investigations examining well-being as a process are emerging <ref type="bibr">(Heshmati et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Stocker et al., 2023)</ref>. Such approaches would provide a deeper understanding of how well-being elements interact and change, offering a richer, more nuanced perspective than is possible with traditional static models.</p><p>Our findings also highlight the need for integrating intra-and interindividual approaches in investigations of psychological constructs. While inter-individual research helps identify general trends and common patterns across large groups of people, intra-individual research focuses on the unique experiences of individuals as they live their daily lives <ref type="bibr">(Molenaar, NETWORK DYNAMICS OF WELL-BEING 33 2004)</ref>. Combining these approaches could lead to a richer understanding of fluid psychological constructs such as well-being in fluctuating developmental stages such as young adulthood, one that acknowledges and incorporates the variability and personalization evident in our findings.</p><p>Our findings prompt rethinking well-being intervention designs and implementations for young adults, especially those transitioning to college, moving beyond one-size-fits-all approaches that overlook the nuances that characterize a person's well-being. Moreover, the dynamic nature of these networks -where the importance and influence of certain elements can shift over time -suggests that well-being interventions should be adaptable and responsive to changes in an individual's life context. The Process-Based Therapy approach <ref type="bibr">(Hayes &amp; Hofmann, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr">Heshmati et al., 2024b)</ref> is one example of such an approach in the clinical sciences (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Westhoff et al., 2024)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion and Limitations</head><p>The current investigation of well-being as a dynamic system challenges the status quo of its static study in the psychological sciences.</p><p>Although our study offers significant insights into well-being's complexity, it is not without limitations. Reliance on self-reported data may introduce biases; however, the use of EMA reduces recall bias from participants with their in-the-moment responses about their experiences. Moreover, the sample size and convenience sampling, though adequate for initial explorations, may prevent us from drawing generalizable conclusions to NETWORK DYNAMICS OF WELL-BEING 34 more diverse populations. Ultimately, this study marks a critical step toward redefining how well-being is conceptualized and studied in young adults. By embracing the complexity and individuality revealed in our analysis, both researchers and practitioners can better serve the diverse needs of individuals in this stage of life.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>students (age: M = 18.41 years, SD = 0.61) during the weeks following the first state-mandated university lockdowns in California due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Spring 2020.

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_7"><figDesc>individual, for example, might experience a strong synchronous relationship between Positive emotions and Relationships, indicating that their emotional well-being is closely tied to the quality of their interpersonal connections. Another individual might have more pronounced synchrony between Meaning and Accomplishment, suggesting that their sense of purpose and fulfillment is related to their achievements and productivity. These differences in synchronization not only underscore the personalized nature of well-being in daily life for young adults but also highlight the complex ways in which different dimensions of well-being can be interdependent.Such differences suggest that each person's well-being is shaped by a unique combination of factors, which may not be fully represented by general models. For example, a first-year college student may be experiencing periods of academic success, showing strong connections between Accomplishment and Positive emotions in their well-being network, while another student may find meaning through personal relationships, showing stronger connections between Meaning and Relationship dimensions. This divergence in the composition and dynamics of individual well-being networks highlight the inherently person-specific nature of wellbeing in young adults and that well-being is not a static construct but a continuously evolving interplay of various factors. Each individual's network of well-being elements can change in response to external pressures and internal traits, highlighting the need for dynamic approaches in both research and practical applications.</figDesc></figure>
