<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This proof-of-concept study introduces the Social Morphology Ball, a framework for visualizing multivariate social data as three-dimensional morphological structures. The method normalizes variables using the median and interquartile range (IQR), followed by nonlinear compression with a hyperbolic tangent function to reduce the impact of extreme outliers. Each normalized variable is mapped onto spherical basis functions, transforming numerical relationships into geometric deformations-bulges or concavities-on a sphere. When all variables align with their long-term medians, the model yields a perfect sphere representing a morphologically neutral, structurally balanced state. Implemented in Python, the pipeline automates normalization, shape generation, and visualization, exporting results in STL, PNG, and GIF formats. Applied to Japanese national statistics from 2015-2023, the model captured temporal variations in the balance and distortion of societal indicators through intuitive 3D forms. By interpreting data as morphology rather than numbers, this approach extends social data visualization into a sensory and cognitive domain, providing a conceptual foundation for morphological visualization of social phenomena and potential applications in education, policy, and data-driven art.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Background</head><p>Multivariate datasets that simultaneously handle heterogeneous variables-such as medical, social, statistical, and public health data-are indispensable for understanding the underlying mechanisms, structures, and phenomena of complex systems. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> Visualizing numerical data provides researchers with valuable insights across a wide range of academic disciplines. However, such information is typically presented in two-dimensional formats-such as tables or graphs-which often makes it difficult to intuitively grasp the interrelationships and overarching structures among variables. In the social sciences, in particular, datasets that span multiple domains-demography, economics, health, environment, welfare, and social institutions-are frequently reduced to single-index evaluations that fail to capture essential variations across dimensions. To enable simultaneous comparison and comprehensive understanding across these domains, more integrative visualization methods are needed to generate new perspectives.The author hypothesized that treating data as morphological entities-that is, as structured forms-could facilitate a more intuitive understanding of multidimensional relationships within social structures. Here, the term "morphological" refers to the structural or geometric forms of multivariate data, rather than to its biological or linguistic usage.This study focuses on a spherical "Ball" model as the core framework, though the principle can be extended to other geometrical forms such as polyhedra, tori, or multilayered spheres. The proposed approach represents an attempt to express interdependencies and cyclicity among data in a tangible, visual form. Beyond serving as a methodological tool for both practical and academic interpretation of social statistics, it may also function as an interactive, art-inspired medium for conveying the "pulsation" of society to the general public, including audiences outside specialized fields. Ryu Murakami</p><p>The artist Mathieu Lehanneur has created sculptural artworks that materialize demographic data into threedimensional forms, exemplifying how quantitative information can be transformed into tangible, spatial representations. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> In this proof of concept, we sought to transcend the planar and static limitations of conventional visualization techniques and to represent the overall structure of society as a sculptural, three-dimensional form. Specifically, multiple social indicators were transformed into three-dimensional geometries and rendered as spheres to depict societal equilibrium and distortion in a geometric manner. This approach is grounded in the concept of mathematical morphology, reconstructing numerical datasets into physical and visual forms. The objective of this proof-of-concept study is to present a methodological framework that reconstructs social data-as a collection of numerical values-into geometric forms, thereby capturing equilibrium and variation as geometric features. While previous studies in data visualization have mainly focused on two-dimensional representations (e.g., maps, scatterplots, and network diagrams), few have explored the possibility of morphologically reconstructing social data into tangible, three-dimensional forms. The present study introduces the concept of the "social morphology ball", a framework that treats multivariate social indicators as a unified geometric entity, thereby extending the idea of data visualization into the realm of morphological cognition. This conceptual shift-from observing data to feeling societal structure-constitutes the novel contribution of this work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Methods 2.1 Data used for implementation testing</head><p>To ensure the reproducibility of the proposed method, both the datasets and the Python scripts used for analysis are made publicly available as supplementary materials. The statistical data were prepared in CSV format, in which each row corresponds to a year and each column (after the first) represents a social indicator (variable). The first column stores the year. The data were entered using Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corporation). For the purpose of this preliminary implementation test, all datasets were obtained from the statistical database managed by the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications of Japan. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> The dataset consisted of annual data from 2015 to 2023, which were manually retrieved by the author from the official database and compiled into a CSV file.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Results</head><p>First, the visualization results obtained when all social indicators were uniformly set to 0.5 are presented (Supplement; Test_05.csv). Under this uniform condition, the model generated a perfectly spherical structure, and the heatmap showed no variation across variables or years. This configuration represents a morphologically neutral baseline, indicating a completely balanced state without directional bias or deformation (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>). Under a uniform CSV (all entries = 0.5), preprocessing centers every variable at its median (IQR = 0), so no deformation occurs; spheres remain perfectly neutral.  Only two specific variables (Supplement; Soc_OppositeTrend.csv) -Total Population and Number of New Car Registrations-were varied in opposite phases while all other variables were fixed at their median values, the resulting Ryu Murakami geometry exhibited a pronounced polar elongation. As one variable increased and the other decreased relative to their respective medians, the sphere deformed symmetrically along the vertical axis, forming a distinct bipolar distortion (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>). Note that the geometric effect of any pair of indicators depends on their assignment to bases; e.g., "polar elongation" arises when indicators are mapped to polar-sensitive bases such as cos Œ∏.  Next, a CSV file containing actual social statistical data (Supplementary; Soc_Indicators_Jpn.csv) was used to generate the spherical models. The resulting visualizations revealed that fluctuations in the input variables produced corresponding geometric deformations in the spheres, indicating that the model successfully translated variations in the multidimensional data into three-dimensional morphological changes (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6</ref>).  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion and Outlook 4.1 Morphological extensions and potential applications</head><p>In the visualization generated from actual social statistical data, the sphere corresponding to 2019 appeared morphologically smoother than those of other years. This outcome reflects that the input variables for 2019 were numerically closer to their respective medians, resulting in smaller normalized deviations and, consequently, a shape nearer to the morphologically neutral baseline. In this model, each social indicator is mapped to a specific spherical basis function, and the overall form of the sphere emerges as the superposition of these basis components weighted by the normalized values of each variable. Therefore, variations in the numerical values of each indicator directly translate into geometric deformations along the directions represented by their respective basis functions. Furthermore, because the assignment of variables to basis functions depends on the order of the column in the input CSV file, Ryu Murakami rearranging the sequence of variables alters the spatial correspondence between social indicators and the surface regions of the sphere. This property indicates that the "morphological correspondence" between data dimensions and spatial directions can be flexibly defined, providing an experimental framework for exploring structural relationships among multivariate indicators through shape transformations. In this framework, the spherical model serves as the fundamental form for morphologically reconstructing multivariate social data. By extending the model to other geometric structures, the proposed approach could help represent the multilayered and nonlinear characteristics inherent in social systems. In contrast to spherical visualization techniques commonly used in fields such as neuroscience or geospatial analysis, this framework does not merely project existing variables onto a fixed sphere. Instead, it reconstructs the sphere itself as a dynamic morphological representation, in which surface deformations reflect the relative balance and distortions among multiple social dimensions. The spherical basis expansion that forms the foundation of this method can, in principle, be extended to other geometric structures with relative ease. Several possible extensions are envisioned:</p><p>‚Ä¢ Polyhedral model: By treating variable groups as faces or vertices, this model can emphasize the tensions and network structures among the elements constituting society.</p><p>‚Ä¢ Torus model: Suitable for representing cyclic or recurrent social phenomena such as economic fluctuations or seasonal health indicators.</p><p>‚Ä¢ Hyperbolic or saddle-surface model: Applicable to illustrating social polarization or bifurcated structural patterns within a population.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Applications and Perspectives</head><p>This sensory interpretation aligns with emerging discussions in data physicalization and embodied cognition, both of which emphasize the importance of tactile and spatial perception in understanding complex information systems. Within this context, the proposed model transforms social indicators into physical morphology, enabling observers to intuitively perceive social equilibrium and distortion as tangible forms. In this proof of concept, we introduce a novel approach to interpreting social phenomena from a sensory perspective-"feeling" the texture of the ball as a metaphor for perceiving social fluctuations. This framework extends beyond conventional data analysis, offering potential applications in education, art, and policy development.</p><p>‚Ä¢ Education: In educational settings, 3D-printed models can serve as tactile teaching materials that allow students to grasp the structure of society in a tangible manner.</p><p>‚Ä¢ Policy-making: In policy contexts, the model can intuitively visualize imbalances among social indicators, contributing to clearer identification of societal challenges.</p><p>‚Ä¢ Art and media: In artistic and media domains, data can be presented as sculptural objects, enabling new forms of expression that convey the "shape" of social phenomena. Furthermore, by focusing on the structural characteristics of data-such as morphological distortions-rather than on numerical differences alone, this approach provides a novel analytical perspective distinct from conventional statistical or graph-based methods. By differentially analyzing temporal changes, it becomes possible to trace dynamic structural deformations and identify turning points in social transformation as morphological transitions. Given that social phenomena are inherently complex and shaped by multiple interacting factors, integrating and visualizing these multidimensional relationships in three-dimensional form offers a meaningful framework for capturing the structural dynamics of social systems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Limitations of the Present Method</head><p>This method presents certain limitations. First, there is an inherent ambiguity in determining which specific variables and basis function combinations contribute to localized deformations on the spherical surface. Therefore, rigorous scientific interpretation should be complemented by conventional statistical analyses for validation. Second, because variables such as population or number of medical institutions are mapped onto spatial basis functions for visualization, the resulting shapes do not derive from strict mathematical foundations. As a result, the analysis may carry elements of interpretive arbitrariness, and caution is required when deriving theoretical conclusions. Finally, this</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Year, Total population (persons), Number of births (persons), Number of deaths (persons), Japanese population (persons), Number of general hospitals (facilities), and Number of new car registrations (units).</figDesc></figure>
