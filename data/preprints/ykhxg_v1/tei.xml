<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>The lack of diversity in language acquisition research has received increased attention in recent years. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Kidd and Garcia (2022)</ref> found that 87% of articles published in major language acquisition journals from 1975 to 2020 were based on North American or European samples, and only 1.5% of the world's languages were represented in those journals. Documenting the course of language acquisition across cultural and linguistic groups is critical for both theory and practice. To build a robust and accurate theory of the human capacity to learn and create languages, we need to consider the full range of contexts in which children are raised. One example of a cross-cultural success story is the noun bias. Early work established that, in a variety of contexts, children initially learn more nouns than verbs <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Gentner, 1982;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Gentner &amp; Boroditsky, 2001)</ref>. Subsequent studies identified two cases in which verbs were acquired earlier, diluting or eliminating the noun-bias: Mandarin <ref type="bibr">(Tardiff et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr">Frank et al., 2021)</ref> and Tseltal <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Casillas et al., 2024)</ref>. These contrasts provide critical insight on the mechanisms underlying this bias (e.g., the concreteness of nouns and verbs and their frequency in one-word utterances). Thus, our understanding of language acquisition in general is strengthened with each language we study.</p><p>Cross-cultural and cross-linguistic data may also shed light on the patterns of individual differences observed within a culture. Some of these patterns appear to be cross-culturally robust (in the contexts studied so far), while others are more variable.</p><p>Female children and firstborn children show early vocabulary advantage over male and later-born children, though the magnitude of these differences depends on how vocabulary is measured <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Huttenlocher et al., 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr">2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Hoff-Ginsberg, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bornstein et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr">Frank et al., 2021)</ref>. Household education is also a consistent predictor of children's language development <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Hoff, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Rowe, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">Frank et al., 2021)</ref>. This may be because more educated caregivers more often engage in activities that have been found to be associated with early language learning, such as play and reading <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Jeong et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Cuartas et al., 2020)</ref>. Some studies also find that children living in urban settings have larger vocabularies than children from rural communities, perhaps due to differences in household income and education <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bornstein &amp; Cote, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Vogt et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Southwood et al., 2021)</ref>. This pattern, however, seems to depend on the wider context of urbanization: a recent study comparing rural families in China to recently relocated peri-urban families finds that rural children have larger vocabularies on average <ref type="bibr">(Ma et al., 2024)</ref>. There is also variation in studies comparing monolingual and bilingual children. While most studies find that multilingualism predicts lower vocabularies in each individual language, the findings on total vocabulary (the sum of both languages) or total conceptual vocabulary (the number of concepts for which the child has a word) are more variable <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bialystok et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Cote &amp; Bornstein, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Singh et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Byers-Heinlein et al., 2024)</ref>.</p><p>Under-representation also creates real-world consequences that can be felt in the lives of children and caregivers. The growth of children's vocabulary is a key component of early language acquisition that is linked to language and literacy skills in school <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Lee, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Can et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Bornstein et al., 2014)</ref>. Supporting language learning is a target for intervention in supporting early childhood education <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Suskind et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Weber et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Wong et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Dupas et al., 2023)</ref>, particularly in low-and middle-income countries where children are at heightened risk of delayed development <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Black et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Sania et al., 2019)</ref>. By excluding under-represented groups from this research, we risk failing to learn about the range of different paths leading to healthy development <ref type="bibr">(Rogoff et al. 2017)</ref>. Using research based on a minority of the world's population to inform early childcare and education policies internationally compromises the effectiveness of these policies and threatens the autonomy of vulnerable communities. Thus, there is an urgent need for more studies focusing on the acquisition of understudied languages in diverse social contexts.</p><p>In this paper, we will examine the early vocabularies of 937 children whose parents had participated in a longitudinal randomized control trial as adolescents in 2009. Parents were from low-income households in rural areas of southern and central Ghana and had qualified for admission to high school but failed to enroll due to financial constraints.</p><p>Roughly one-third of participants were given scholarships that covered high school fees.</p><p>Since then, these participants have been followed over time to study the effects of high school access on health, income, education, and family status <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Duflo, Dupas, &amp; Kremer, 2021)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Prior studies of vocabulary growth in African languages</head><p>Caregiver reported measures offer several advantages over direct assessment of young children, particularly in field studies. First, caregiver reports are easier to implement. Direct assessments of children require highly trained surveyors for consistent administration, while caregiver reports can be administered with little training. Direct assessments also require quiet, private spaces to avoid distraction, which is often impossible in settings where testing is conducted outdoors. They also involve testing children, who are less compliant and more distractible than adults, limiting the number of questions or trials that can be given. In contrast, caregiver reports allow for more thorough and broad assessments of the child's behavior. A popular caregiver reported language measure is the MacArthur-Bates CDI, a vocabulary checklist that has been adapted into almost 100 languages <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Marchman &amp; Dale, 2023)</ref>. Adaptations of the MB-CDI have been previously used to measure the effects of child educational interventions in low-and middle-income countries, particularly short form CDIs that provide a brief snapshot of children's language development <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Fenson et al., 2000)</ref>. In other cases, the MB-CDI Short Form has been used as a starting point for creating vocabulary checklists specialized for use in particular contexts, such as highly multilingual settings <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Vogt et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Prado et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>We located six papers that have adapted some version of the CDI (Words and Gestures or Words and Sentences, both short and long forms) for use in six African countries (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). These adaptations typically focused on rural communities outside of major cities, but some included communities living in or around urban centers. Many of the communities were multilingual; in these cases, researchers either focused on a single linguistic group within a country <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Childers et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Weber et al., 2018)</ref>, created a CDI for each language spoken <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Alcock et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Southwood et al., 2021)</ref>, or created a conceptual CDI that tracked vocabulary across all languages spoken in a household <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Vogt et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Prado et al., 2018)</ref>. Half of the studies sought formal approval from the CDI advisory board; primarily those that created dedicated checklists for an individual language. Most of the studies began by translating an existing CDI and then refining the measure through local consultation and piloting; however, <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Prado et al. (2018)</ref> created an initial word list by eliciting common child words from caregivers.</p><p>All of these studies reported statistics that supported the validity of the measure. For example, four studies found vocabulary to be correlated with the age of the child, and four found correlations between the parent report and the child's production in a speech sample.</p><p>Two studies reported convergent validity with other assessments of child development adapted for the setting, such as the MDAT <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Gladstone et al., 2010)</ref>, or with assessments that were being normed in parallel, such as the Wolof Milestone Checklist <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Weber et al., 2018)</ref>. In addition, <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Prado et al. (2018)</ref> reported a later follow-up with their Ghanaian participants in preschool where their previously measured vocabulary was positively related to performance on language and cognitive testing, demonstrating the predictive validity of the checklist. Reliability statistics were less commonly reported; Cronbach's alpha was reported as a measure of internal consistency in two studies. The size of these samples varied greatly, from 8 children to almost 900 <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Prado et al., 2018)</ref>, all between the ages of 12 and 30 months, the age range in which the CDI is typically administered in other settings.</p><p>These studies also frequently reported correlations between vocabulary scores and the LEXICAL DEVELOPMENT IN GHANA 8 demographic characteristics of their sample. For instance, girls were found to have larger vocabularies on average <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Vogt et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Weber et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">Southwood et al., 2021)</ref>, as were children living in more urban areas <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Vogt et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Southwood et al., 2021)</ref>. The relationship between household education and vocabulary varied: <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Vogt et al. (2015)</ref> reported a positive correlation (with productive vocabulary, but not receptive vocabulary) and <ref type="bibr">Southwood et al. (2021)</ref> found no correlation with their productive vocabulary checklist.</p><p>In some cases, researchers adapted the CDI specifically to test the efficacy of randomized controlled trials. <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Prado et al. (2018)</ref> created the Malawi and Ghana checklists to test the effects of a lipids-based nutritional supplement on 18-month-olds' language development <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Prado et al., 2017)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Weber et al. (2018)</ref> adapted the CDI-WG Short Form into Wolof to test the effects of an educational intervention in which Senegalese mothers from rural, low-income communities were enrolled in a parenting program that encouraged verbal engagement with their infants <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Weber et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Other researchers have used their adapted CDIs to explore theoretical questions in understudied populations. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Childers et al. (2007)</ref> used the checklist to investigate the presence of a noun bias in Ngas-speaking children; they found little evidence for an early bias, which they argued reflect properties of Ngas that made verbs easier to acquire. They also found that time spent in joint attention with caregivers predicted overall vocabulary size. Mastin and Vogt (2016) used the Mozambican CDI adaptation to examine how different social experiences shaped the vocabularies of children living in urban and rural communities. They found that time spent in joint attention with caregivers predicted vocabulary in urban children vocabulary, while time spent in one-on-one interactions with caregivers predicted vocabulary in rural children. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Current Study</head><p>Beginning in 2017, surveyors conducted biennial check-ups on the children of the original intervention participants to assess the possible downstream effects of high school scholarships on child health and cognitive development <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Duflo et al., 2024)</ref>. At each visit, children were administered an age-adjusted testing battery that assessed their language, executive function, and numerical, spatial, and mental-state reasoning. For 14-to 25-months-old children, their primary caregiver was asked to report their vocabulary using a checklist adapted from the American English MacArthur Bates CDI <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Fenson et al., 1994)</ref>. Children of scholarship recipients did not differ in vocabulary size from controls <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Duflo et al., 2024)</ref>. However, children of female scholarship recipients were found to have a lower mortality rate and their caregivers engaged in more preventative health behaviors (e.g., prenatal care), as well as more play and conversation with their child, as measured by both reported activity and naturalistic daylong recordings.</p><p>Here, we explore children's performance on the vocabulary checklist, collapsing across the treatment and control conditions. Ghana is a highly multilingual country, with most people speaking at least two local languages <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Omane et al., 2023)</ref>. Most of the children in the sample were spoken to in a dialect of Akan, a Niger-Congo language that is the most prevalently used language in the country <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Osam, 2003)</ref>. Akan syntax is primarily SVO.</p><p>Akan phonology permits V, C, and CV syllables and exhibits vowel harmony within words <ref type="bibr">(Dolphyne, 1988)</ref>. Unlike languages in other Niger-Congo families like Bantu, Akan lacks a noun class system but relies on a complex system of prefixing and suffixing to mark both singular and plural <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Osam, 1993)</ref>. Verbal morphology is marked for tense, aspect, and mood through a combination of affixation and grammatical tone <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Osam, 2003)</ref>. Due to contact with English, loan words are also common, particularly in education, politics, health, and sports <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Apenteng &amp; Amfo, 2014)</ref>. Akan is composed of two major mutually-intelligible dialect groups, Twi and Fante. However, English is the official language of Ghana and is used in government, education and business. Given this context, we used the checklist to assess children's productive and receptive conceptual vocabularies across all languages they were exposed to at home.</p><p>It is important to highlight that this checklist is not a formal adaptation of the CDI Words and Gestures, which would require far more controlled and language-specific vetting than was able to be performed here. Instead, it is a caregiver reported tool created for the purpose of evaluating a randomized controlled trial on a diverse, multilingual sample of families in Ghana, using the CDI Words and Gestures as a starting point (similar to e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Vogt et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Prado et al., 2018)</ref>. According to a review of 237 randomized controlled trials registered through the American Economic Association, less than one-third of interventions targeting children's school-related skills reported any measure of contextual validity or reliability for their assessment <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Macours, Williams, &amp; Wolf, 2023)</ref>. Because of this, the first part of our analysis focuses on establishing its effectiveness as a measure of individual differences. We have also tried to control for sources of variance, such as differences across surveyors and differences in form translation, that may have been introduced during administration. It is our hope that our evaluation procedure might help other researchers improve the ecological validity of measures designed for use in settings where data collection is challenging.</p><p>First, we investigate the reliability and validity of the checklist. A previous study of the assessment battery on the children in the control condition found that reported receptive vocabulary was associated with later performance on a receptive picture vocabulary test constructed to measure the intervention effects at 3 years (r=0.19), providing evidence for its predictive validity <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Coffey &amp; Spelke, 2024)</ref>. However, no item-level analysis of checklist performance was reported. To do so, we constructed a Rasch model, a psychometric model that uses item responses to produce estimates of item difficulty and respondent ability. This model allows us to determine whether responses to individual items deviate significantly from their predicted values, suggesting their inadequacy as test items. Second, we explored the predictors of children's vocabulary size, including gender, multilingualism, birth order, child-centered stimulating activities, and whether children resided in or close to a city. Finally, we examined differences in the syntactic composition of children's vocabularies. In keeping with previous cross-linguistic studies of caregiver-reported vocabulary, we expected to find that nouns and social words made up a larger proportion of words known than predicates and closed-class items for children with lower total vocabularies, compared to children with larger vocabularies (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Braginsky et al., 2019)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>In total, 986 caregivers were administered the vocabulary checklist. After excluding children who were tested outside of the original age range (n=3), children who were missing information about caregiver education (n=5) and birth order (n=32), and duplicate tests (n=9), we arrived at a final sample size of 937 children (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>). The vocabulary assessment was initially administered to children from 14-to 22-months of age, and up to 25-months beginning after 2018 <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Duflo et al., 2024)</ref>. All data was reported by the child's primary caregiver, who in almost all cases was the child's biological mother (95%). Most caregivers reported speaking to their children mostly in some dialect of Akan (Twi or Fante) (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>). However, over half of caregivers also reported their children were regularly exposed to more than one language, typically Akan and some combination of Ghanaian English, Nzema, and/or Ewe, corroborating other surveys of language exposure in Ghanaian homes <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Omane et al., 2023)</ref>. Based on caregiver-reported language use, these homes were considered multilingual. A little over half of parents lived far outside of urban areas (n=NA, 71 missing). The sample reflected the proportion of participants assigned to the treatment condition, with two-thirds of children coming from control households.</p><p>Primary caregiver education ranged from no primary school to post-secondary education.</p><p>Caregivers were also surveyed on whether anyone in the home had engaged the child in storytelling, playing, singing, reading, or drawing, counting, and object-naming in the last month. These activities were based on those used in the Multiple Indicators Cluster Survey (UNICEF, 2005) and selected based on previous research that has found them to be associated with the pace of children's cognitive development <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Jeong et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Cuartas et al., 2020)</ref>. On average, caregivers reported that children had engaged in at least 3 of these activities in the last month, most commonly playing and singing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Materials</head><p>The MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventories Words &amp; Gestures Short Form (hereafter CDI-WG for brevity) was used as a starting point for the checklist <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Fenson et al., 2000)</ref>. The CDI-WG short form was designed for use with infants 8 -18 months of age. We chose it because our plan was to focus data collection efforts on children 14-to 22-months of age, thus our group fell between the age range for the CDI-WG and the age range for the Words &amp; Sentences short form (CDI-WS) which targets 16-to 30-month-olds. The CDI-WG includes words that are more appropriate for younger children than the CDI-WS and asks parents to report not only on vocabulary production, but also on comprehension, which is typically difficult to report accurately for older children with larger vocabularies. We decided to base our checklist on the instrument for the younger age group for two reasons. First, we reasoned that there was a greater risk of getting floor effects if we used the CDI-WS than there were of getting ceiling effects if we used the CDI-WG given the pattern observed at the youngest and oldest ages at which each measure is used <ref type="bibr">(Frank et al., 2017)</ref>. Second, the success of the Oxford English CDI, which was normed on children between the ages of 12-24 months suggested that it was possible to measure vocabulary comprehension and production with a single instrument across this age range <ref type="bibr">(Hamilton et al., 2000)</ref>.  Note. n and % give the total number of caregivers and the percentage of the total sample.</p><p>However, to ensure the measure is still sensitive in this age range, we examined both vocabulary sub-scores for evidence of ceiling effects. We found no evidence for these even in the oldest children, suggesting that our measure captures meaningful differences in children's vocabularies across this age range. We also conducted separate analyses of item-based performance for production and comprehension. This analysis could reveal whether some items performed appropriately as measures of productive vocabulary but not receptive vocabulary.</p><p>Before the first round of testing, the English CDI-WG was piloted with 50 caregivers of young children in the Volta region of Ghana, to ensure there was no overlap with families participating in the intervention. These families were a convenience sample, assumed to be similar to the intervention sample with slightly less education. Local surveyors were also consulted on the appropriateness of each vocabulary item for Ghanaian children. This information allowed researchers to eliminate items that did not appear to be relevant in this context. Words without appropriate translations into Akan (e.g., away) or those that lacked proper cultural equivalents (e.g., applesauce) were removed. Others were replaced with analogous items that were likely to be familiar to children (candy to toffee, ouch! to ajeii!). The vocabulary list was first drafted in English (i.e., the language of education and government). Later, this list was translated into Akan (with Twi and Fante variants, where applicable) beginning in round 12 to increase the consistency of surveyor translation. A total of 387 caregivers were administered the survey with these translations.</p><p>The final checklist consisted of 88 lexical items divided into 17 syntactic-semantic categories. As in previous studies, words were classified into one of four syntactic groups based on which semantic category they belonged to <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bates et al., 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Caselli et al., 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr">Coffey &amp; Snedeker, 2025)</ref>. A full comparison of the checklist with the CDI-WG wordlist can be found in Supplementary Materials. These included 24 social words (sound effects, games and routines, and people), 42 nouns (animals, vehicles, toys, food and drink, clothing, body parts, furniture, household items, and outside things), 14 predicates (action words and descriptive words), and 8 closed-class items (time words, pronouns, and question words). Due to improper coding of three food and drink nouns (meat, eggs, beans), we only examine 85 lexical items in this analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure</head><p>Surveyors conducted 17 rounds of testing between 2017-2023. For each round, surveyors were assigned to a geographical area in and around Accra to conduct surveys of families (based on their last known address) for 3-4 months. The vocabulary checklist was administered to children's primary caregivers as a part of the survey on their child's development.</p><p>Caregivers were asked to report on the conceptual vocabulary of a given child when the child reached the eligible age range, such that each child had a single report. Due to mixed literacy and language use in the sample, the checklist was read verbally to caregivers in the language they reported speaking to the child, as has been done in other similar settings (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Alcock et al., 2015)</ref>. In cases where the primary caregiver spoke a language other than Akan or English, the surveyor gave translation equivalents for each of the words in the language spoken to the child at home. As each word was read from the list, the caregiver was asked to indicate whether the child understood or could say the word in any of the languages spoken in the home, producing a single measure of conceptual vocabulary across languages.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary</head><p>The analyses below were conducted in R (v 4.4.1) (R Core Team, 2024). On average, children could produce 21 words (25%) and understand 40 words (47%) (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>). As a first pass check of reliability, we checked the correlation between productive and receptive vocabulary sub-scores. We believed these scores would not be correlated if the caregiver LEXICAL DEVELOPMENT IN GHANA 18 responses were not properly logged, caregivers did not understand the instructions given by the surveyor, or caregivers were not reliable reporters of their children's vocabularies.</p><p>Productive and receptive sub-scores were found to be highly correlated (r = 0.80, p &lt; .001). Examining the distribution of these scores, we see that productive vocabulary is right-skewed, while receptive vocabulary is roughly normally distributed (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). We find significant associations between child age and vocabulary size (receptive r = 0.57, p &lt;</p><p>.001; productive r = 0.68, p &lt; .001) (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>).</p><p>Receptive Productive  and vocabulary size given by r.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Psychometrics properties of the checklist</head><p>We fit the data to a Rasch model, a single parameter item response theoretic model that simultaneously estimates each child's latent ability and the difficulty of each item, using the eRm package <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Mair &amp; Hatzinger, 2007)</ref>. Previous evaluations of CDI measures have used the Rasch models as simple and flexible models of vocabulary knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Weber et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Kachergis et al., 2023)</ref>. With this model, we examined the psychometric properties of the assessment by examining instrument reliability and item-level performance.</p><p>Instrument-level Reliability. To measure instrument-level reliability, we calculated Cronbach's alpha, which is the equivalent of taking split-half reliability for each possible division of the trials. Both sub-scores (productive and receptive) demonstrated high internal consistency as measured by Cronbach's α (productive = 0.98; receptive = 0.98). From the Rasch model, we also calculated another measure of reliability, person-separability, which measures the amount of person parameter variance not attributable to error. The sub-scores each had high person separability (productive = 0.95; receptive = 0.96). These converging results indicated that productive and receptive vocabulary measures were reliable.</p><p>Item-level performance. We examined how well children's production and comprehension of each word fit our Rasch model by calculating its information-weighted mean square fit, or infit, which has been previously used to evaluate item-level performance in varied assessments of child development and psychology (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Weber et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">Weisz et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">Duran et al., 2019)</ref>. Infit is expressed as the ratio of observed residuals by the expected residuals of the model. Ideally, vocabulary items will have an infit of 1, when observed and expected variance are equal. An infit greater than 1 indicates higher variance than expected, or underfitting, which suggests the presence of noise or unmodeled sources of variance. These items are less able to discriminate between higher-and lower-performing children. An infit less than 1 indicates lower variance than expected, or overfitting to the model, such that these items overestimate differences in performance.</p><p>To identify the items with poor fit, we set acceptability cut-offs between 0.75 and 1.33 (following <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Weber et al., 2018</ref><ref type="bibr">, citing Wilson, 2005)</ref>. For production, we found that 6 words had infits above threshold, signaling low discriminability (meow, ajeii, grandma, grandpa, shh, thank you) and 4 had infits below threshold (leg, cup, spoon, mouth), signally over discrimination. For receptive vocabulary, no words fell outside of this range.</p><p>Every word with high infits was a social word, which are generally acquired by children in the first few months after their first word. These words have been found to have lower discriminability across different CDIs <ref type="bibr">(Frank et al., 2021)</ref>. There are many possible explanations for this. Caregivers might overestimate children's knowledge of these words.</p><p>Knowing these words could depend on characteristics of the household unrelated to language ability, like the presence of certain family members (i.e., grandparents) or routines <ref type="bibr">(i.e., meow, thank you, ajeii, shh)</ref>. Usage of some words may reflect individual and family stylistic preferences: children might know what ajeii! (ouch!) means but use a different word or phrase when expressing pain. In contrast, all words with lower infit and higher discriminability are common nouns, referring to body parts or things found in the kitchen. It is possible that some parents teach these words as sets or use them in the same routines (leg and mouth) or (cup and spoon), and thus production of these words is more indicative of which routines the parent uses than it is of the child's language level. It is also possible that words like cup and spoon might only have been produced by older children who are weaned and would use dishware and thus not be related to overall language level. This might also explain why these words perform well in receptive vocabulary.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Vocabulary</head><p>We examined the degree to which demographic characteristics that have been associated with language development in other studies predicted productive and receptive conceptual vocabulary size in the dataset. We constructed linear mixed-effects models with lme4 <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bates et al., 2015)</ref>, using the number of words on the checklist known as the response variables. Each model was constructed with a random intercept for the surveyor who administered the checklist. This was done to control for any variance in children's vocabulary size introduced by individual surveyors, whose choice of translation of certain words may have differed. Using stepwise model comparison, we determined whether predictors improved overall model fit by conducting likelihood ratio tests (reported by χ 2 statistic) and comparing corrected Akaike Information Criterion. We introduced predictors into the model according to the amount and consistency of evidentiary support for their effects on vocabulary: age (months from 14 months onward), child gender (treatment coded, male reference), primary caregiver education (treatment coded, "did not attend high school" reference), birth order (treatment coded, firstborn reference), caregiver-reported child-centered stimulating activities in the last month (summed and converted to z-score), and multilingualism in the home (treatment coded, monolingual reference). All continuous variables were converted to z-scores; in our models we report standardized coefficients. In addition, a quadratic term for age was also introduced, as previous work has found that the rate children's vocabulary growth accelerates as they grow older <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Pan et al., 2005)</ref>.</p><p>Because information about urbanness (treatment coded, rural reference) was missing for 71 children, we refit our best-fitting models on a subset of participants with this information to determine whether there was any vocabulary advantage present in children living in urban areas.</p><p>For receptive vocabulary, the best-fitting model included child age (main ß = 0.18, t = 20.81, p &lt; .001), gender (ß = 0.18, t = 3.61, p &lt; .001), stimulating activities (ß = 0.18, t = 6.64, p &lt; .001), and multilingualism (ß = 0.16, t = 2.96, p = 0.003) (Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>).</p><p>Nakagawa's R 2 indicated that fixed effects terms explained 36.50% of variance and the random intercept for surveyor explained 3.80%. Adding a term for checklist translation did not improve model fit (χ 2 (3) = 3.37, p = 0.34). Fitting our best-fitting model to the subset of data with urbanness, we did not find it to be a significant predictor of receptive conceptual vocabulary size (main ß = 0, t = -0.06, p = 0.954).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 3 . Mixed effects linear regression models predicting receptive conceptual vocabulary</head><p>For productive vocabulary, the predictors of the best-fitting model were the same: child age (main ß = 0.14, t = 5.59, p &lt; .001; quadratic ß = 0.01, t = 3.84, p &lt; .001), gender (ß = 0.18, t = 3.94, p &lt; .001), stimulating activities (ß = 0.15, t = 6.16, p &lt; .001), and multilingualism (ß = 0.10, t = 2.05, p = 0.041) (Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>). Notably, the child age quadratic improved model fit, indicating that productive (but not receptive) conceptual vocabulary size increases non-linearly. Fixed effects terms explained 50.90% of variance and the random intercept for surveyor explained 1.20%. Checklist translation did not improve model fit (χ 2 (3) = 2.91, p = 0.41). Urbanness was also not significantly related to conceptual productive vocabulary (main ß = -0.01, t = -0.16, p = 0.873).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Syntactic composition</head><p>Finally, we examined how the syntactic composition of children's vocabularies changed over time. It is well-established across many languages that children learn nouns and social words like kinship terms and common routines earliest, followed by verbs and adjectives, and then closed-class items like such as articles or prepositions <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Fenson et al., 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Caselli et al., 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Gentner et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bornstein et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Braginsky et al., 2019)</ref>. We used the approach described in Frank et al. ( <ref type="formula">2021</ref>) using the langcog package to compare the proportion of words in each category that children know to their overall vocabulary size.</p><p>We first capture the trends in vocabulary composition by constructing a generalized linear model predicting the proportion of words known in each category to the total proportion of the checklist known, fitting third-order polynomials to the model to capture nonlinear relationships in the data. The regression is constrained such that the coefficients of the regression sum to 1. This ensures that the model treats children that are reported as knowing the entire checklist (i.e., x=1) as also knowing every word within a given syntactic category (i.e., y=1). Assuming that we would expect the proportion of words known in a given category to increase monotonically with total knowledge of the checklist, a line </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>In this study, we examined trends in vocabulary growth in a large sample of children growing up in Ghana using a caregiver reported vocabulary checklist. Caregiver reports are practical as means of assessing language development in low-and middle-income countries.</p><p>They require little training to administer, do not require private or quiet spaces, and can be delivered verbally to caregivers in communities with low rates of literacy. Short-form methods are particularly useful, as they are quick and easier to implement at a large scale, while also providing a detailed snapshot of children's early vocabularies. This checklist was designed as part of a battery to measure the downstream effects of a high school education intervention parents participated in on their children's development. We will first discuss the psychometric properties of the checklist, focusing on its effectiveness for tracking children's language. Next, we will review significant predictors of children's vocabulary growth. Finally, we will examine changes in the composition of children's vocabulary across development.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Establishing validity and reliability</head><p>We found evidence that the checklist was effective at tracking individual differences in vocabulary size in the sample. Caregiver responses exhibited high internal consistency and person separability, indicating good reliability. Reported vocabulary size grew with child age, and receptive and productive vocabulary were highly correlated. The vast majority of items on the checklist were effective at distinguishing low and high-vocabulary children. In sum these findings provide support for the reliability and validity of the checklist for measuring children's vocabulary in the population. There were a few items on the checklist that were either under or over discriminating. These words were mostly in productive vocabulary, and included some social words, names for body parts, and common items found in eating spaces. Future research might seek out different translations for these terms, replace them with others similar words, or omit them entirely. Social words in particular have been reported as relatively less discriminating across different CDIs, possibly because caregivers use laxer criteria in determining whether their children know these words <ref type="bibr">(Frank et al., 2021)</ref>. Removing these words or replacing them with other items might improve the ability of the checklist to accurately measure children's language ability.</p><p>However, eliminating them also risks distorting our understanding of word learning and vocabulary composition. For instance, social words follow different developmental trajectories than other categories, being acquired earlier than common nouns <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bates et al., 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Caselli et al., 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Caselli et al., 1999)</ref>. In our own analysis of syntactic composition, social words followed an expected developmental trajectory, being over-represented in smaller vocabularies and under-represented in larger vocabularies. Thus, it may be desirable for some researchers to ask about these words regardless of fit.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Demographic predictors of vocabulary growth</head><p>The present study also explored several potential demographic predictors of vocabulary growth. For both receptive and productive vocabulary, we found that girls and children from multilingual homes had higher conceptual vocabularies on average than boys and children from monolingual homes. Girls have been observed to have an early advantage in word learning across a multitude of languages and cultures <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Huttenlocher et al., 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bornstein et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr">Frank et al, 2021)</ref>. This advantage has also been documented in various African languages <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Vogt et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Weber et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">Southwood et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>We also found that caregiver reported activities with their children were positively related to conceptual vocabulary. Caregivers were surveyed on items selected from the Multiple Indicators Cluster Survey, which have been related to children's cognitive development, including their receptive and productive language, across dozens of different countries around the world <ref type="bibr">(Jeong et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Cuartas et al., 2020)</ref>. A common explanation is that these activities afford children the opportunity to learn from caregiver input. Children's vocabulary as measured by caregiver checklist has been previously associated with caregiver input produced during e.g., play, reading, and object-naming <ref type="bibr">(Salo et al., 2016)</ref>. Parents who engage children in these activities might also attend more closely to children's vocabulary growth, allowing them to more fully report on their children's total vocabulary. Another possibility is that the pace of children's cognitive development and their elicitation of stimulating activities from their caregivers might each be influenced by the same genetic influences. <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Starr et al. (2024)</ref> found that longitudinal associations between caregiver reports of stimulation and cognitive development in a sample of 15,000 twins growing up in the U.K. were not causal in nature but instead were explained by genetic and shared environmental factors.</p><p>In contrast, our finding that the children from multilingual households have larger conceptual vocabularies than the children from monolingual households is surprising and highlights the degree to which the relationship between multilingualism and early word learning varies across cultural, socioeconomic, and linguistic contexts. Studies that focus on total vocabulary size (the sum of both languages) sometimes find that young bilingual children know more words than monolingual children (see e.g., <ref type="bibr">Byer-Heinlien et al., 2024)</ref> and sometimes find the opposite (see e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Cote &amp; Bornstein, 2014)</ref>. However, studies that measure conceptual vocabulary size (the total number of concepts for which the child has a word, calculated by only counting translation equivalents once) either find no difference between the bilinguals and monolinguals (see e.g., <ref type="bibr">Byers-Heinlein et al., 2024 for comprehension;</ref><ref type="bibr">Junker &amp; Stockman, 2002)</ref> or find that the bilinguals have smaller conceptual vocabularies than the monolinguals (see e.g., Byers-Heinlein et al., 2024 for production; <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Core et al., 2013)</ref>.</p><p>What might account for the larger conceptual vocabulary size of the multilingual children in the sample? It seems unlikely that this is a direct effect of multilingualism per se. To learn a word you must hear it, and the multilingual child necessarily splits their time between two languages, typically resulting in slower growth in each individual language. Under some circumstances total vocabulary may grow faster in multilingual homes because it is easier to learn words for some concepts than for others (see e.g., <ref type="bibr">Coffey &amp; Snedeker, 2025)</ref> and the child has the opportunity to expand their vocabulary by learning two words for these concepts (rather than having to acquire the harder ones).</p><p>There is, however, no current theory that predicts that multilingualism should result in a larger conceptual vocabulary. Presumably this could happen if different words were difficult to produce in each language or when the early vocabulary in each language (or culture) has less overlap. We do not believe that either of these factors is accounting for this pattern in the current data set: we see parallel effects in comprehension and production, the lexical items were chosen because they were believed to have translation equivalents that would be relevant to a child in the languages spoken by these families, and there is no reason to believe that the language pairs spoken by these children would be more likely to show these effects than the other language pairs that have been studied.</p><p>This effect might also be an artifact of how the tool was designed and deployed.</p><p>Caregivers were administered the checklist verbally by the surveyor in the language they were most comfortable conversing in. However, the checklist text the surveyors read from was written out in English. Thus, if surveyors defaulted to English during the administration of the survey, it may have resulted in more reporting from families who used English more frequently. If this were true, we would expect more noise in the data set for children whose families didn't speak English at home. While we did not find the language of the checklist was associated with overall vocabulary size, there may still be noise at the item level. To test this, we reexamined the reliability and validity of the checklist, dividing the sample into two subgroups of children who had some exposure to English (n = 416) and children who had none (n = 521). We found no differences in internal consistency or person separability between the groups. We found 7 additional items that exhibited poor fit in the sample with no English exposure (5 in productive vocabulary, 2 in receptive vocabulary).</p><p>Each of these belonged to the same categories as the poorly fitting items in our original analysis (i.e., kinship: uncle; body parts: face, hand; kitchen items or furniture: chair, plate; games and routines: hide and seek), with the exception of seesaw (outside words).</p><p>We also found 3 additional items that exhibited poor fit in the English exposed sample, all in receptive vocabulary. As with the non-English exposed sample, these words belonged to the same categories as the poorly fitting items in the combined analysis (body parts: leg;</p><p>games and routines: bye bye) with the exception of an outside word water. Notably, none of the additional poorly fitting words are shared across English and non-English exposed groups. It is possible that a small amount of additional noise was introduced to productive conceptual vocabulary size in non-English-speaking households compared to English-speaking homes. However, the consistency of the effect across both productive and receptive conceptual vocabulary measures, as well as the lack of association with checklist language translation, suggests that this did not account for the affect of multilingualism.</p><p>A second possibility is that these effects arise from an association between multilingualism and other social or economic factors that affect word learning (or parental reports). For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Vogt et al. (2015)</ref> report larger vocabularies in urban areas, where bilingualism is more common than in rural areas. The bilinguals in their sample were more often exposed to Portuguese, which is also the language of government and education in Mozambique. Around three-fourths of multilingual children in our sample were exposed to English as a second or third language, which could also be correlated with being in a more urban or educated household. We conducted a chi-squared test to determine whether there was an association between these variables and English language use in the home. As with our reanalysis of reliability and validity, we split children into two groups by their reported exposure to English. We found no association between urbanness and exposure to English (χ 2 (1) = 2.29, p = 0.13), but we found a significant association between primary caregiver education and English exposure in the home (χ 2 (1) = 89.96, p &lt; .001), such that primary caregivers reporting English language use were more likely to have post-secondary education (207 vs. 105 with no English) and less likely to have no high school education (209 vs. 416 with no English).</p><p>Despite this association, we found no main effect of caregiver education on vocabulary. Still, it is possible English language use may index other differences in the home environment relevant to children's language development. For instance, when schooling is conducted in English, pedagogical activities may become associated with that language, such that they are more likely to occur if English is used in the home. Thus, English use might be a proxy for the presence of activities that positively predict vocabulary growth. We conducted t-tests comparing the frequency of caregiver-child activities between children with and without English language exposure. We found that households with English language use are more likely to report engaging in these activities with children (3.38 vs. 2.59 activities) (t = 9.99, p &lt; .001). The effects of multilingualism on vocabulary may result in part from the association between English usage and caregiver-child interaction. However, for both receptive and productive conceptual vocabulary, multilingualism remained significant even after the introduction of stimulating activities into each respective model. Additionally, we conducted an exploratory analysis fitting our same models to the data set only including children who were exposed to Akan and/or English. We found that multilingualism was no longer a significant predictor of productive conceptual vocabulary but remained a significant predictor of receptive vocabulary. These findings suggest other unmeasured factors might also be at play.</p><p>We did not find a significant main effect of caregiver education on vocabulary size.</p><p>Household education, particularly maternal education, has been widely found to be associated with differences in early language development in studies conducted in North America, Europe and East Asia <ref type="bibr">(Frank et al., 2021)</ref>. In an U.S. context, education has been associated with increased willingness and opportunity to engage in conversation and other forms of verbal engagement with children, which has been found to mediate the relationship between language development and socioeconomic status broadly (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Huttenlocher et al., 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr">2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Hoff, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Rowe, 2008)</ref>. In studies using the parental reports in African countries, the pattern is less clear, with some studies reporting positive effects of maternal education or educational interventions <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Vogt et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Weber et al., 2017)</ref>, and some reporting none <ref type="bibr">(Southwood et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>It is possible that effects of education and income were not observable due to limited variation within the sample. One of the parents of each of the infant participants had been selected for the study because 1) they were from a low-income household in a rural area of southern or central Ghana, and 2) they had qualified for high-school admission based on their performance on the entrance exam but failed to enroll in high school by the deadline due to financial constraints. As a result, the vast majority of caregivers reported having at least finished junior high school with 9 years of education (n = 835, or 89%). By comparison, <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Vogt et al. (2015)</ref> followed households in Mozambique that reported mostly either primary schooling or no formal schooling. There may not be substantial differences in the home environment on the basis of education within this range in our sample.</p><p>We also found no evidence of differences in vocabulary by birth order. Previous CDI studies in North America, Europe and East Asia, have generally found that firstborns have larger productive vocabularies than laterborns but not larger receptive vocabularies <ref type="bibr">(Frank et al., 2021)</ref>. Some studies have linked these effects to differences in caregiver input, finding that parents direct longer utterances to firstborn children compared to laterborn children <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Hoff-Ginsberg, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Huttenlocher et al., 2010)</ref>. Firstborn children are also more likely to receive one-on-one attention from caregivers than laterborn children, who must share their parents' attention with their siblings. None of the African-adapted CDIs examined birth order as a predictor of vocabulary. One possible explanation for these findings is that firstborn status may not result in more input from adult caregivers. For instance, smaller intervals between firstborn and laterborn children might result in a shorter period where firstborns receive individualized attention: firstborns may need to compete for attention earlier than children in other countries. This seems unlikely in the dataset: the median age gap between siblings in the data set is about 3 years, which is well in-line with norms in the U.S. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Martinez &amp; Daniels, 2023)</ref>. Other studies in other African communities have found that young children spend much of their daily lives supervised by older child caregivers, who talk less and produce less complex speech than adult caregivers <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Harkness, 1977;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Nwokah, 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Loukatou et al., 2022)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Vogt et al. (2015)</ref> found that children in Mozambique who have a child secondary caregiver have lower vocabularies than children with another adult caregiver. Therefore, it is possible that birth order may not affect the amount of speech children hear from adults.</p><p>Lastly, we found no association between living in an urban area and reported vocabulary. Prior results using parent-reported vocabulary measures have been mixed <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Vogt et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Southwood et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr">Ma et al., 2024</ref>), which appears to reflect the different contexts in which urbanization occurs and the different effects it has on parenting.</p><p>It is possible that there are differences that are typically present in urban vs. rural samples that were eliminated in our study because the parents were drawn from a highly uniform sample of adolescents from similar regions and socioeconomic strata.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Noun bias in cross-linguistic studies of word learning</head><p>There has been considerable theoretical interest in which words children learn first and why and how this changes across languages and cultural contexts. To explore these patterns, we constructed predictive models to analyze trends in the syntactic composition of children's vocabulary. We found that the children in the sample had a noun bias in both reported vocabularies. Predicates and closed-class items were also under-represented in children's vocabularies. Social words were more likely to be over-represented early but were under-represented later in development, especially in productive vocabulary. This pattern parallels the shifts in vocabulary composition that have been observed in North America, Europe and many parts of East Asia <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Braginsky et al., 2019)</ref>. While the noun bias is clearly absent in some studies and some languages (see e.g., <ref type="bibr">Tardiff et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Tardif et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Childers et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Casillas et al., 2024)</ref>, our findings demonstrate that it is not limited to Western cultures but instead may reflect deeper differences in the concepts that words encode, the roles that they play in sentences, and how children isolate their forms and meanings (see e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Gentner, 1982;</ref><ref type="bibr">Gillette et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr">Coffey &amp; Snedeker, 2025)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations</head><p>The current validation of the checklist has limitations that could be addressed in future work. Due to the age and language background of the children in the sample, there was no gold-standard, standardized test against which we could standardize our measure.</p><p>Future work, however, could compare performance on the vocabulary checklist to other caregiver-reported measures, such as speech diaries or parent's spontaneous recall (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Alcock et al., 2015)</ref>. Our study also provides no direct evidence of the predictive validity of our measure. A previous analysis found that reported receptive vocabulary predicted performance on a novel receptive picture vocabulary test administered to the same children at 3 years <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Coffey &amp; Spelke, 2024)</ref>. This vocabulary test was also created to evaluate the effects of the intervention; thus, as with concurrent validity, we are unable to make comparisons to other existing standardized measures. Because vocabulary knowledge in late infancy is correlated with later language and literacy skills in school, checklists such as these are especially valuable to educators and policymakers for their predictive power.</p><p>Such patterns have also been found in Ghana, with <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Prado et al. (2018)</ref> finding that their checklist predicted later performance on the IDELA <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Pisani et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Another limitation comes from the lack of survey information about language exposure. Although caregivers were asked to report on languages children were exposed to, no measure of children's relative exposure to different languages was collected. It is unclear for instance whether a caregiver reporting Akan, English, and Ewe exposure uses these languages equally often, whether the child has relatives who occasionally visit and use one or more of these languages, or if caregivers only use particular words from some of these languages in the context of code-switching. In an environment like Ghana, children may be exposed to up to 6 languages in daily life <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Omane et al., 2023)</ref>. In a U.S. context, multilingualism is often defined in terms of the proportion of the child's speech exposure coming from each language, with 25% or 30% exposure to another language often being used as a cutoff for distinguishing monolinguals from multilinguals (e.g. <ref type="bibr">Core et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Byers-Heinlein et al., 2024)</ref>. We believed that it would be difficult for caregivers to accurately report exposure proportions. Furthermore, there was not sufficient time for surveyors to interview parents about the child's vocabulary in each language. For these reasons, we focused our surveys on capturing the child's total conceptual vocabulary.</p><p>While studies of relative input and vocabulary sizes within each language provide critical insight into language acquisition in multilingual <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Pan, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Hoff &amp; Luz Rumiche, 2011)</ref>, assessing total conceptual vocabulary was sufficient for our goal of characterizing individual differences in the pace of language development.</p><p>Our limited knowledge about the children's input is particularly relevant to interpreting the finding that multilinguals had larger conceptual vocabularies than their monolingual peers. We cannot directly ascertain which languages contributed to this effect because we did not directly assess vocabulary in each language. Because this effect has not been previously reported, we believe that it reflects factors that are correlated with multilingualism in this environment rather than being a direct consequence of multilingual exposure. For example, we know that caregiver use of English (the most common second language) is related to their engagement in stimulating activities with their children.</p><p>We also failed to locate any prior diary studies of early vocabulary acquisition in this context on which to base the selection of words. As a result, the checklist was adapted directly from the CDI-WG short form checklist. It is possible then that the checklist missed words that might be more important to children's acquisition. These include parts of speech that might appear in Akan or other languages that would not appear in English.</p><p>The checklist might also have missed more culturally appropriate terms within the 17 semantic categories selected.</p><p>Finally, there is also a need to establish the ecological validity of the checklist, the degree to which what caregivers report on the checklist generalizes to children's real life deployment of their language skills. There are several reasons for questioning the ecological validity of caregiver reports in research on cultural variation in patterns of engagement between parents and their children. Caregiver reports assume that the child spends most of their time with an adult caregiver who tracks the child's developmentally relevant behaviors. This assumption is fairly accurate in Western households, where children spend most of their day with their parents and are spoken to from birth. However, it has been observed in many African cultures that parents do not speak to children until the children begin to speak themselves, and preschool-aged children may spend most of their time away from their parents with siblings or peers <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Harkness, 1977;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Nwokah, 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Loukatou et al., 2022)</ref>. Thus, it is important to establish the relationship between caregiver reports and other, more ecologically valid, measures of child language use. One way this has been done in previous studies is by comparing the checklist to children's naturalistic production of language <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Alcock et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Vogt et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Prado et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Weber et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>The children in the present study were filmed during a short 5-minute play session with their primary caregiver, which was transcribed by a trained surveyor. Thus, there is a path to establishing the ecological validity of the parent report measure in the future.</p><p>Acknowledging these limitations is critical for ensuring the ethical use of this instrument. Assessments with poor sensitivity can underestimate the effects of interventions and fail to identify children with language impairments. Assessments that are not well adapted for the culture or language of the participants can reinforce stereotypes that all African children suffer from widespread cognitive delay. Although field research in African communities, particularly rural communities, comes with unique challenges that are not encountered in most research in North America and Europe, it is essential that researchers work closely with local communities to create ecologically appropriate measures and that these measures are subject to formal evaluations of their validity and reliability.</p><p>We are uniquely positioned to provide such an evaluation. Of the six African checklist adaptations we located in our review, only <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Prado et al. (2018)</ref> reports a sample of similar size to our own. Because the families in our study came from diverse regions, languages and levels of education, there are good reasons to believe that these findings might generalize to other similar populations. Our finding that the language of the survey did not affect reported vocabulary is clearly relevant to future groups studying language development in Ghana and similar settings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>We examined trends in vocabulary growth using a short-form caregiver reported vocabulary checklist adapted for use with 14-to 25-month-old children in Ghana. We find a small but reliable effect of gender on vocabulary size, such that girls had larger vocabularies than boys on average. We also find that children whose parents reported their children being exposed to multiple languages also reported higher vocabularies. This association is linked to a relationship between English exposure and the frequency of reading, play, and other activities that have been found to support language development.</p><p>No association is found between vocabulary size and education, suggesting a more complex relationship between parental education and early child development than has previously been posited. Finally, we find that the syntactic composition of children's vocabulary changed in predictable ways throughout development, supporting theories that attribute these shifts to universal features of language learning that generalize across contexts and languages <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Gentner, 1982;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Snedeker &amp; Gleitman, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Coffey &amp; Snedeker, 2024)</ref>. We also suggest reasonable guidelines for evaluating the validity and reliability of vocabulary assessments developed for use in contexts where such measures are difficult to develop, such as in studies with wide age ranges or studies conducted in highly multilingual societies.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1 .
