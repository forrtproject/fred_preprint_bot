<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Loneliness is a global public health issue. Many nations are showing high prevalence rates of loneliness, and several nations have appointed ministers of loneliness to help address and reverse the growing rates (Office of the U.S. Surgeon General, 2023; The <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Lancet, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Surkalim et al., 2022)</ref>. Elevations in loneliness lead to compromised immunity and increased risk for anxiety, depression, chronic illness, and mortality <ref type="bibr">(Barjakova et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Cacioppo et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Lara et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Luhmann et al., 2023)</ref>. Our recent research showed that middle-aged adults in the U.S., England, and Mediterranean Europe report elevated levels of loneliness compared to previous generations and peers in Continental and Nordic Europe <ref type="bibr">(Infurna et al., 2025)</ref>. Historical increases in U.S. middle-aged adults' loneliness and disadvantages as compared with European nations are simultaneously transpiring with rises in depressive symptoms, heavy alcohol use, and daily stress as well as historical declines in memory, physical health, and life expectancy <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Almeida et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Ayyala-Somayajula et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr">Blain &amp; Boissonneault, 2025;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Case &amp; Deaton, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Harris et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Infurna et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Kirsch et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wettstein et al., 2025)</ref>. Despite these vulnerabilities among middle-aged adults in the U.S. and some nations/regions across Europe, we know little about whether nation-level policy factors are associated with these historical trends and disparities between nations. The objective of the current study is to examine whether policy pertaining to family benefits and income inequality are associated with these disparities in midlife loneliness between the U.S. and Europe. This research promises to provide insights into policy levers to help reduce midlife loneliness.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Significance of Midlife</head><p>Middle-aged adults form the backbone of society by constituting a large majority of the workforce and constituting family leadership that bridges younger and older generations <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Infurna, Gerstorf, &amp; Lachman, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Lachman et al., 2015)</ref>. Given the integral role that middle-aged adults play in society and family, this makes them vulnerable to stressors that could be a detriment to their mental health and might increase their risk of loneliness. Stressors in midlife arise from disruptions in work/life balance, family discord, personal health issues, and job stress that have increased across historical time compared to younger and older adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Almeida et al., 2020)</ref>, which can accumulate over time to undermine mental health <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Infurna et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Zautra, 2006)</ref>. Middle-aged adults also face demands on their time through increased work and caregiving responsibilities with (adult) children and aging parents <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Fingerman et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Financial vulnerabilities have arisen in the form of larger expenses for childcare, healthcare, and education <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Infurna et al., 2020</ref>; Office of the U.S. Surgeon General, 2024). Following the Great Recession, U.S. middle-aged adults today exhibit more daily stress, health symptoms, chronic illness, functional limitations, and lower psychological well-being than their same-aged peers in the 1990s <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Almeida et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Goldman et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Kirsch et al., 2019)</ref>. Declining life expectancy and deaths of despair have been driven by rising mortality amongst working-age adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Case &amp; Deaton, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Harris et al., 2021)</ref>. These historical trends, typically operationally defined as differences based on individuals' birth year, are largely confined to the U.S., with European nations not showing such historical declines across numerous indicators spanning mental, cognitive, and physical health and life expectancy <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Harris et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Infurna et al., 2021</ref><ref type="bibr">Infurna et al., , 2025;;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wettstein et al., 2025)</ref>. Specific to loneliness, previous research observed that laterborn middle-aged adults in the U.S., England, and Mediterranean Europe reported elevations in loneliness, compared to earlier-born individuals, and historical stability was observed in Continental and Nordic Europe <ref type="bibr">(Infurna et al., 2025)</ref>. These historical trends pertaining to loneliness are largely specific to middle-aged adults. Empirical evidence suggests that for older adults (aged 65 and older) historical improvements have been observed in well-being and cognition and declines in loneliness <ref type="bibr">(Gerstorf et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Hülür et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Suanet &amp; van Tilburg, 2019)</ref>. In young adults, historical increases in loneliness have been observed <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Buecker et al., 2021)</ref>, whereas stability has been observed among children and adolescents <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Clark et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Lempinen et al., 2018)</ref>. This raises the question of why middle-aged adults report better or worse mental health depending on the nation in which they reside.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Role of Nation-Level Policy Factors in Midlife Development</head><p>Conceptual models examining midlife development have postulated that macro-level structures, such as policy and social and economic inequality, serve as upstream distal factors that could impact midlife outcomes through intermediary (e.g., community) and proximal (e.g., health behavior) mechanisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Harris et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Infurna et al., 2020)</ref>. Theories on social change, such as the relative deprivation theory, posit that individuals and countries respond differently to the gradual changes in social, cultural, historical, and economic contexts <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Power et al., 2020)</ref>, which have implications for individual and population-level well-being. We examine two sets of policy factors that are likely associated with disparities in midlife loneliness trajectories and represent differences in availability of nation-level resources, namely, family benefits from the government (i.e., social capital resources) and income inequality (i.e., monetary resources).</p><p>Structural differences in macro-level structures of family benefits and income inequality exist across the U.S. and European nations, and research suggests that there are historical changes in each factor that align with the individual-level findings. For example, since the early 2000s, public spending on family benefits has risen in Europe, whereas it has remained stagnant/declined in the U.S. <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Neef &amp; Sodano, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr">OECD, 2024</ref><ref type="bibr">OECD, , 2025;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Piketty et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Conversely, income inequality has risen in the U.S. during this same period, whereas income inequality has stabilized and narrowed in most European nations <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Neef &amp; Sodano, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr">OECD, 2024</ref><ref type="bibr">OECD, , 2025;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Piketty et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Family policy. Policy models pertaining to family refer to government expenditure relating to financial support for families and children. These range from child-related cash transfers to families with children (e.g., child allowances and income support during parental leave) and public spending on services for families (e.g., subsidized childcare), all the way to financial support through the tax system (e.g., tax exemptions). In nations such as Germany and Sweden that have more generous family programs than the U.S. (e.g., subsidized childcare, income support during parental leave, and child allowances), both parents and non-parents in midlife report higher levels of well-being <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Avendano et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Glass et al., 2016)</ref>, and life expectancy has been rising <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Beckfield &amp; Bambra, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Lundberg et al., 2008)</ref>. Expansions to paid family leave policies in the United Kingdom and Germany during the 1990s and early 2000s were associated with improvements in midlife well-being, even benefiting current generations of parents <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Ribanszki et al., 2022)</ref>. For middle-aged adults, family programs are highly relevant because insufficient short-term family care and lack of support for children beyond the period of infancy and childhood could contribute to financial pressures and workplace insecurity, each of which relates to compromised well-being <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Jody et al., 2007)</ref>. As discussed by <ref type="bibr">Glass and colleagues (2016)</ref>, greater investment in family programs benefits could increase the likelihood of both parents remaining in the workforce and contribute to attaining higher income and savings/assets. Previous research targeting family benefits has primarily focused on outcomes of life expectancy and well-being, but not loneliness. The lack of investment in family programs could lead to higher levels of and accelerated increases in loneliness through increasing parenting stress, time demands, and financial strain <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Glass et al., 2016)</ref>, and parents (i.e., women) having to withdraw from the workforce <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Heshmati et al., 2023)</ref>, which restrict the time that is left for social activities and to maintain one's social network to counteract loneliness.</p><p>Social and economic inequality. Income inequality broadly refers to how nations differ in the (un)equal distribution of economic and social resources across citizens. The U.S. has pronounced disparities across SES, which likely contributes to between-nation differences in mental health <ref type="bibr">(Avendano &amp; Kawachi, 2014)</ref>. Empirical research has primarily focused on wellbeing, showing that citizens in nations with greater income inequality report poorer well-being <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Diener et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Kung et al., 2022)</ref>. A cross-sectional study focusing on older adults found that citizens of nations with higher income inequality, as measured by the GINI coefficient, report higher levels of loneliness <ref type="bibr">(Tapia-Munoz et al., 2022)</ref>. A notable limitation of this study was the lack of examination of longitudinal trends and the exclusion of middle-aged adults.</p><p>Income inequalities likely shape midlife loneliness trajectories through social comparison and increasing barriers to resources, opportunities, and material conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Marmot, 2007)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Present Study</head><p>We aim to better understand whether the nation-level policy factors of family benefits and income inequality are associated with between-nation disparities in levels and rates of change in midlife loneliness across historical time (i.e., birth year). Previous research targeting links between nation-level policy factors and midlife outcomes has primarily used crosssectional data and focused on well-being and life expectancy. Our use of harmonized data from representative longitudinal panel surveys allows a direct test of whether public spending on family benefits and income inequality is associated with similarities and differences in trajectories of midlife loneliness in the U.S. and 13 European nations <ref type="bibr">(England, Austria, Belgium, Switzerland, Germany, Denmark, Spain, France, Greece, Italy, Netherlands, Sweden, and Israel)</ref>. Another major step forward in our study is the use of longitudinal data that permits tracking within-person changes in midlife loneliness and the extent to which variations in nationlevel policy factors impact within-person changes over historical time. Our focus on examining within-person changes over time permits for determining the long-term effects of nation-level policy factors on loneliness trajectories. Nation-level policies pertaining to family benefits and income inequality are pertinent to middle-aged adults due to their embeddedness in the workforce and family involvement. Findings arising from our study will identify specific social conditions, programs, and policies (e.g., increasing family benefits and reducing income inequality) that may inform reasons for differences in levels and rates of change in loneliness between the U.S. and European nations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study Design</head><p>Longitudinal panel surveys consisting of nationally representative samples were used from 14 different nations, including the U.S. (Health and Retirement Study, HRS), England (English Longitudinal Study of Ageing, ELSA), and Europe (Survey of Health, Ageing, and Retirement in Europe, SHARE; Austria, Belgium, Switzerland, Germany, Denmark, Spain, France, Greece, Italy, Netherlands, Sweden, and Israel). We used data harmonized by the Gateway to Global Aging team, which can be accessed via their website (https://g2aging.org).</p><p>Harmonization involves combining datasets from different sources into a consistent, standardized, and comprehensive format for analysis. In the current study, each incorporated dataset assessed loneliness using an identical measure and involved midlife participants who were assessed longitudinally. This provides the opportunity to examine whether some of the nation-level policy factors underlying historical change in midlife loneliness operate similarly or not across the gathered data. We included participants who provided data when they were aged 45 through 65 because this is the generally accepted age range for midlife <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Lachman, 2004)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Transparency Statement</head><p>The syntax for data preparation and the analyses are provided through the Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/3qeyx/?view_only=0f76c620ef914681b08f45dd4db0abce). This study was not preregistered. Each dataset is publicly available and requires access through user agreements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants and Procedures</head><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> provides an overview of the data characteristics for each study.</p><p>The HRS <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Sonnega et al., 2014)</ref> began in 1992. It is a nationally representative sample of households in the contiguous U.S. comprising adults aged 50 years and older and their spouses (spouses younger than 50 were included). Participants provide biennial data on sociological, psychological, and physical health information. Data is collected via in-person and telephone interviews, and every six years, a new cohort is recruited to maintain sample size and heterogeneity. We used data from 2002 to 2018 because 2002 is when data on loneliness began to be collected. In total, 13,217 participants who provided data when they were aged 45 to 65 were included in the analyses (60% women; education: 14% less than upper secondary education, 60% upper secondary education and vocational education, and 26% tertiary education; health conditions: M = 2.22, SD = 1.60, range 0 to 8; ever unemployed = 11%; ever divorced = 21%; ever widowed = 11%; have children = 91%). This analysis used data or information from the Harmonized HRS dataset and Codebook, Version C, as of January 2022, developed by the Gateway to Global Aging Data.</p><p>The ELSA <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Steptoe et al., 2013)</ref> began in 2002 and is a nationally representative longitudinal survey collecting multidisciplinary data on adults aged 50 and older (and spouses younger than 50) living in England. We used biennial assessments from 2004 to 2018/2019 because 2004 is when data on loneliness began to be collected. In total, 9,793 participants who provided data when they were aged 45 to 65 were included in the analyses (56% women; education: 24% less than upper secondary education, 55% upper secondary education and vocational education, and 21% tertiary education; health conditions: M = 1.44, SD = 1.29, range 0 to 7; ever unemployed = 5%; ever divorced = 14%; ever widowed = 8%; have children = 83%).</p><p>This analysis used data or information from the Harmonized ELSA dataset and Codebook, Version G.2 as of July 2021, developed by the Gateway to Global Aging Data.</p><p>The SHARE <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Börsch-Supan et al., 2013)</ref> began in 2004 and is a cross-national longitudinal panel survey on the mental and physical health, and social and family networks of individuals in Europe and Israel. We only included nations that began in Wave 1 because these provide enough observations over a long enough time frame to examine within-person longitudinal change. These nations were Austria, Belgium, Switzerland, Germany, Denmark, Spain, France, Greece, Italy, Netherlands, Sweden, and Israel. We used data from 2010/11 to 2019/2020 because 2010/11 is when data on loneliness began to be collected. In total, 36,020 participants who provided data when they were aged 45 to 65 were included in the analyses (57% women; education: 33% less than upper secondary education, 39% upper secondary education and vocational education, and 28% tertiary education; health conditions: M = 1.35, SD = 1.29, range 0 to 8; ever unemployed = 9%; ever divorced = 9%; ever widowed = 5%; have children = 89%). This analysis used data or information from the Harmonized SHARE dataset and Codebook, Version F as of June 2022, developed by the Gateway to Global Aging Data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Outcome</head><p>Loneliness in each study was assessed using the same Three-Item Loneliness Scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Hughes et al., 2004)</ref>, which asked how often participants experience the following feelings: they lack companionship, feel left out, and feel isolated from others. Participants answered using the following response scale: (1) hardly ever or never, (2) some of the time, and (3) often. The three items were averaged, with higher scores indicating higher levels of loneliness. To ease interpretability, we converted the measure to a T-Score metric (M = 50, SD = 10), using the entire sample of 59,030 participants. In a T-Score metric, 1-point is equivalent to .1 SD.</p><p>The Three-Item Loneliness Scale is derived from the longer 20-item UCLA Loneliness Scale and assesses global feelings of loneliness, particularly the isolation facet, as opposed to other facets of loneliness (relational connectedness and collective connectedness; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Hawkley et al., 2005)</ref>. Using an indirect approach, items had been intentionally formulated to avoid the term loneliness as opposed to a direct approach that asks openly about feelings of loneliness <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(von Soest et al., 2020)</ref>. Internal consistencies or Cronbach alpha at each wave of assessment in each study were as follows: HRS: α's ranged from 0.78 to 0.82; ELSA: α's ranged from 0.83 to 0.84; SHARE: α's ranged from 0.74 to 0.79. Regarding validity, previous research using this shortened three-item scale found that elevations in loneliness were associated with increased risk for accelerated biological aging, morbidity, disability, and mortality <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Crowe et al., 2021)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Nation-Level Policy Factors</head><p>Public spending on family benefits is taken from the OECD data explorer database (OECD Social Expenditure database). Public spending on family benefits is government expenditure, including financial support exclusively for families and children. This includes child-related cash transfers to families with children and public spending on services for families with children (benefits in kind). Child-related cash transfers include child allowances and public income support payments during periods of parental leave. Benefits in kind include direct financing or subsidizing childcare and early childhood education facilities, public childcare support through earmarked payments to parents, public spending on assistance for young people and residential facilities, and public spending on family services. This indicator is measured in percentage of GDP. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">S1</ref> in the supplemental materials shows data on public spending on family benefits for each nation across assessments. Nations showing consistently higher levels of public spending on family benefits than the U.S. (Greece and Italy showed comparable levels to the U.S.) were England, Sweden, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, and Germany. For each nation, we took all available years during the study period and then included in our analyses the average across these years (U.S.: M = 0.68, SD = 0.04, range: 0.62 to 0.85; England: M = 3.25, SD = 0.29, range: 2.83 to 3.92; SHARE, Europe: M = 2.25, SD = 0.79, range: 1.21 to 3.73). The average across the assessment years for each participant was used in the analyses because the wave-to-wave correlations were above .90. Follow-up analyses targeted cash transfers vs. benefits in kind separately, and similar findings were observed (see Tables <ref type="table">S6</ref> and<ref type="table">S7</ref>).</p><p>We used data from The World Bank on the GINI coefficient to assess income inequality (World Bank, Poverty and Inequality Platform). Income inequality is the difference in how income is distributed among the population. Income is defined as household disposable income in a particular year. It consists of earnings, self-employment, capital income, and public cash transfers; however, income taxes and social security contributions paid by households are deducted. Inequality is also described as the gap between rich and poor, wealth disparity, wealth and income differences, or the wealth gap. This is based on the comparison of cumulative proportions of the population against cumulative proportions of income they receive. It ranges between 0 in the case of "perfect equality" (that is, each share of the population gets the same share of income) and 1 in the case of "perfect inequality" (that is, all income goes to the individual with the highest income). For ease of interpretation in our analysis, we multiplied the GINI coefficient by 100 to create a percentage index. Table <ref type="table">S2</ref> in the supplemental materials shows the data for each nation on the GINI coefficient across assessments. Nations showing the consistently lowest levels of income inequality were Sweden, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and Germany. For each nation, we took all available years during the study period and then included in our analyses the average across these years (U. Data analysis. Intraindividual changes, age-related, history-related, and nation-related differences were examined using multilevel models <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Grimm et al., 2017)</ref>. This permitted tracking how loneliness develops as people move through midlife (i.e., within-person change), how this may differ across historical time (i.e., between-person differences), and how this may differ across nations (i.e., between-nation differences).

Given the large sample size for the analyses and to guard against false positives (for discussion, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Lakens et al., 2018)</ref>, we use the p &lt; .0001 cut-off for statistical significance for intercept-related parameters, p &lt; .001 for time-related parameters at Level 2, and p &lt; .05 for nation-related parameters at Level 3. We have chosen these different cut-offs because as shown by <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Feingold (2021)</ref>, the power to detect intercept differences was 9.7 times greater than the power to detect slope differences.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>We first examined the extent to which individual differences in midlife loneliness are accounted for by the nations in which individuals reside. The three-level multilevel model acknowledges that individuals are nested within nations, and the "total" variance in intercepts was decomposed into a portion that could be attributed to between-person differences and a portion that could be attributed to between-nation differences. There are substantial differences in levels of loneliness in midlife and a notable portion of these differences are attributed to differences among the nation in which people live. Table <ref type="table">S4</ref> shows that a significant portion of the variance in the intercept could be attributed to between-nation differences. Quantified as an intraclass correlation (6.37 / 6.37 + 51.38), the proportion of between-nation variance was 0.1103. That is, 11.03% of the overall differences in levels of loneliness could be attributed to differences among nations, with the remaining 88.97% being attributed to differences among people. We next included public spending on family benefits and the GINI coefficient as predictors into the three-level multilevel model to examine whether these were predictive of levels and rates of change in midlife loneliness.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Public Spending on Family Benefits Predicting Midlife Loneliness</head><p>Table <ref type="table">2</ref> shows our results from the model examining whether family benefits predict midlife loneliness trajectories. Middle-aged adults who live in nations that devote a larger percentage of their GDP to programs pertaining to family benefits, on average, report lower levels of loneliness (estimate = -1.41 T-score units, p &lt; .0001). For comparison, the average percentage of GDP directed towards family benefits was as low as 0.68% in the U.S. (during the study period from 2002 to 2019), whereas it was as high as 3.48% in Sweden (during the study period from 2010 to 2019). Based on the parameter estimates of the model, this results in a 3.97</p><p>T score unit (d = 0.39) difference between the two nations in midlife loneliness for 50-year-olds born in 1960 (i.e., the model centering point).</p><p>Public spending on family benefits was also found to moderate historical changes in midlife loneliness (family benefits x birth year estimate = -0.04, p &lt; .05). Figure <ref type="figure">1A</ref> shows that participants in nations with greater public spendings in family benefits (i.e., spending at + 1 SD or 3.06% and beyond, which includes Denmark, England, and Sweden) reported lower levels of loneliness and there were less pronounced historical increases. Conversely, Figure <ref type="figure">1B</ref> shows that participants residing in nations with less public spending in family benefits (i.e., spending at -1 SD or 1.02% and below, which includes the United States) reported higher levels of loneliness, and there were greater historical increases (i.e., early and late boomers and Gen X reported higher levels compared to the Silent Generation). Based on the parameter estimates for levels of public spending on family benefits resembling that of the U.S., a 50-year-old born in 1968 is expected to report higher levels of loneliness compared to a 50-year-old born in 1952 (2.30 T score units or 0.23 SD). In contrast, based on the parameter estimates for levels of family benefits resembling that of Sweden, a 50-year-old born in 1968 is expected to report similar levels of loneliness compared to a 50-year-old born in 1952 (-0.51 T score units or -0.05 SD).</p><p>Public spending on family benefits also impacted within-person changes in loneliness (family benefits x time estimate = -0.08, p &lt; .001). Figure <ref type="figure">1B</ref> shows that for individuals earlier in midlife, lower public spending on family benefits was associated with stronger increases in loneliness over time. Middle-aged adults in nations with greater spending on family benefits showed within-person stability in loneliness over time (see Figure <ref type="figure">1A</ref>).</p><p>In follow-up analyses, we separated family benefits into the two components of (a)</p><p>family cash transfers and (b) benefits in kind or public spending on services. Results revealed substantially similar findings to those reported for the combined family benefits (see Tables S6-S7 in the supplemental materials). In nations with more spending on family cash transfers and public spending on services for families with children, on average, middle-aged adults report lower levels of and stability over time in loneliness and less historical increases in loneliness across cohorts.</p><p>Additional follow-up analyses targeted gender differences due to the potential for family benefits of public spending to differentially impact men and women. Analyses stratified by gender are shown in Table <ref type="table">S8</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure">S1</ref> in the supplemental materials. Results revealed that greater investment in family benefits of public spending was associated with lower levels of loneliness for both men (-1.19, p &lt; .01) and women (-1.50, p &lt; .001). Public spending on family benefits moderated historical changes in midlife loneliness for women (family benefits x birth year estimate = -0.05, p &lt; .05) and men (family benefits x birth year squared estimate = 0.01, p &lt; .05). Based on Figure <ref type="figure">S1</ref>, the findings suggest that, on average, women who live in nations with greater public spending in family benefits reported lower levels of loneliness and there were less pronounced historical increases.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>GINI Coefficient Predicting Midlife Loneliness</head><p>Table <ref type="table">3</ref> shows our results from the model examining whether the GINI coefficient predicts midlife loneliness. Middle-aged adults living in nations with less income inequality (as measured by the GINI coefficient), on average, report lower levels of loneliness (estimate = 0.40 T-score units, p &lt; .0001). For comparison, the average for the U.S. across the assessments (2002 to 2019) was 0.41, whereas in Sweden, the average was 0.29 (2010 to 2019). Based on the parameter estimates of the model, this results in a 4.85 T score unit (d = 0.48) difference between the two nations in midlife loneliness for 50-year-olds born in 1960 (i.e., the model centering point). Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2A</ref> shows that participants in nations with less inequality (i.e., -1 SD, which includes Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands, and Sweden) reported lower levels of loneliness.</p><p>In contrast and as illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2B</ref>, participants in nations with more inequality (i.e., +1 SD, which includes the United States and Israel) reported higher levels of loneliness. The GINI coefficient did not moderate historical changes in loneliness (i.e., no moderation with birth year or birth year squared). However, the GINI coefficient moderated within-person changes (GINI coefficient x time estimate = 0.03, p &lt; .0001). Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2B</ref> shows that for middle-aged adults born earlier, more income inequality was associated with stronger within-person increases in loneliness over time. Middle-aged adults in nations with lower income inequality showed withinperson stability in loneliness over time (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2A</ref>).</p><p>Follow-up analyses targeted gender differences due to the potential for income inequality to differentially impact men and women. Analyses stratified by gender are shown in Table <ref type="table">S9</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S2</ref> in the supplemental materials. Results revealed that the direct effect of income inequality was associated with loneliness for both men (0.45, p &lt; .0001) and women (0.40, p &lt; .0001). Income inequality moderated historical changes in midlife loneliness for women (income inequality x birth year estimate = 0.01, p &lt; .05) and men (income inequality x birth year squared estimate = -0.003, p &lt; .05). Based on Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S2</ref>, the findings suggest that, on average, men who live in nations with greater income inequality reported higher levels of loneliness and there were more pronounced historical increases as compared to women.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Our findings demonstrate that nation-level policy factors pertaining to family benefits and income inequality are associated with midlife loneliness. In nations that underinvest in family benefits (as % of GDP) and those with high-income inequality, middle-aged adults are more likely to report higher levels of and exhibit steeper historical increases in loneliness over time. Our findings extend earlier reports of how family benefits and less income inequality are associated with better well-being and higher life expectancy <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Glass et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Lundberg et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Oishi et al., 2011)</ref> by showing that nation-level disparities in midlife loneliness are in part tied to these policy factors. This insight into how nation-level policy factors pertaining to family benefits and income inequality are associated with midlife loneliness prompts discussion about how specific policy levers (e.g., increasing family benefits and reducing income inequality) inform reasons for differences in levels and rates of change in loneliness between the U.S. and European nations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Role of Nation-Level Factors in Midlife Development</head><p>Family policy. Underinvestment in policy pertaining to family benefits was associated with elevations of and historical increases in loneliness over time for middle-aged adults.</p><p>Follow-up analyses revealed that both family cash transfers and benefits in kind or public spending on services were associated with lower levels of loneliness. We also observed gender differences; women residing in nations with greater investment in family benefits policy showed less strong historical increases in loneliness, which could be due to greater ability of women to remain employed in the workforce in countries who invest more in family benefits <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Glass et al., 2016)</ref>. This is in line with previous research <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Heshmati et al., 2023)</ref> and suggests that when childcare benefits or parental leave income are limited, women may be more likely to withdraw from the workforce, potentially leading to elevations in loneliness. The family policy programs of the 14 nations drastically differ from one another. For example, in Sweden, France, and Germany, more generous programs come in the form of a monthly allowance to help offset costs associated with raising children, generous parental leave support, greater investment in education facilities, and low childcare costs through subsidization <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Collins, 2019)</ref>. These types of family programs are not mandated in each of the included nations and differ widely in their availability and extensiveness of coverage <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Feinberg, 2018)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Glass and colleagues (2016)</ref> observed that lower nation-level childcare costs (indexed via % median wage) were associated with higher happiness for all parents, not just those with young children. Potential explanations include subsidies for childcare lower costs, resulting in higher incomes and greater savings and assets across the lifespan. Lower childcare costs could also relate to broader cultural support for families, including feelings of social inclusion and community support <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Glass et al., 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Family policy programs that include cash transfers can be regarded as an investment in social capital, which can directly and positively affect household income (through purchasing goods) and reduce family poverty <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Lundberg et al., 2008)</ref>. Generous family benefits likely lessen loneliness in midlife through individuals not being solely reliant on their own resources and needing to create their own safety net, which is especially pertinent in the U.S., where midlife adults show more residential mobility and are typically less embedded in and isolated from their community (U.S. Surgeon General Report, 2024). Such a safety net would have downstream benefits, including reducing financial strain and overall demands/stressors involved with parenting <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Collins, 2019)</ref>. Family benefit investment allows for better work-life balance (less conflict between work and family responsibilities) and increases parental time with children.</p><p>Such programs contribute to fewer cultural demands and financial pressures <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Luthar et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Income inequality. Middle-aged adults in nations with larger income inequalities report higher levels of and stronger increases in loneliness over time. Follow-up analyses revealed gender differences; men residing in nations with greater income inequality showed stronger historical increases in loneliness, which could be due to fewer economic opportunities for intergenerational and employment mobility, which may be more harmful for men than for women <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Baarck, Bode, &amp; Peichl, 2025)</ref>. The included nations differ in their (un)equal distribution of economic and social resources across citizens, with the U.S., Israel, Greece, Italy, and Spain showing the highest levels of income inequality. Income inequality produces differences in material conditions, exacerbates poverty rates, increases relative deprivation, and reduces the possibility of moving up the SES gradient <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Marmot, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr">Tapia-Munoz et al., 2022)</ref>. Social gradients determine access to education, jobs, social services, income, and wealth, each of which has downstream effects on loneliness <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Marmot, 2017)</ref>. Increased income inequality leads to reductions in general trust and perceived fairness, as well as less satisfaction with public goods (e.g., education and public transportation), each of which is linked to higher loneliness <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Oishi et al., 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Oishi et al., , 2012))</ref>. In countries with a greater income inequality, those with low incomes might, following relative deprivation theory, come up with the "judgment that one or one's group is worse off compared to some standard accompanied by feelings of anger and resentment" (p.., <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Smith &amp; Pettigrew, 2015)</ref>, and probably also by feelings of social exclusion and loneliness.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations</head><p>We note several limitations that point to future routes of inquiry. First, our study focused on two nation-level policy factors that conceptually and empirically have been associated with mental health and well-being and have reason to be linked to loneliness in middle-aged adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Harris et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Infurna et al., 2020)</ref>. However, future research is warranted to explore other pertinent policy factors and cultural variables, including, but not limited to unemployment rates, public health spending, as well as individualism, and religiosity, each of which have been targeted in other periods of the lifespan <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Harris et al., 2021)</ref>. Second, when conducting research on cross-national samples, the issue of measurement equivalence arises. We note that testing for measurement invariance is a huge endeavor that is beyond the scope of this study because it requires testing for invariance across the entire midlife age range, nations, historical time and within-person time, gender and SES strata. The empirical evidence available indicates that effects of longitudinal measurement invariance are small <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Luhmann et al., 2023)</ref>, loneliness is a universal experience that can be measured reliably and validly across cultures <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Hawkley et al., 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Hawkley et al., , 2020;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Maes et al., 2016)</ref>, and the nomological network (e.g., correlations with personality)</p><p>has not changed across historical time <ref type="bibr">(Bücker et al., 2021)</ref>. Third, the testing of three-level multilevel models is challenging, especially when estimating the variance to differ across nations. We deliberately chose model convergence and stability of model estimation over less stable dynamic modeling. Furthermore, given that we used time-invariant constructs for policy factors, this makes it difficult to interpret within-person trends as driven by time-varying national policy factors. We cannot draw inferences about how changes in policies are intertwined with historical increases in loneliness although the wave-to-wave correlations for each of the policy factors are above .90, suggesting that variability in policy factors over time seems to be limited.</p><p>Furthermore, it is possible that loneliness could be the predictor of macro-level factors, rather than the outcome; future research based on quasi-experimental variation or on instrumental variables is needed for more insights regarding causality and disentangle this association.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>Nation-level policy factors are associated with loneliness in midlife and should be taken into consideration for alleviating loneliness. Levels and rates of change in loneliness were related with structural-level factors related to family benefits and income inequality, which informs policy and public endeavors aimed at reducing loneliness. Directions for future research would be to further explore between-person differences in the extent to which policy factors are associated with midlife loneliness, whether other policy factors show a similar impact on loneliness, linking historical changes in policy factors with historical changes in key outcomes, such as loneliness and extend this approach to nations beyond the U.S. and Europe <ref type="bibr">(Akhter-Khan et al., 2004)</ref>. Our findings provide guidance for future research oriented towards identifying mechanisms as a way for policy to ameliorate the loneliness global public health problem. </p><note type="other">Figure Captions</note><p>Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>.

The long thin lines for each generation represent the age trends, and the short-thick lines for each cohort represent within-person changes over 5 years with 1-year age increments. In nations that invest in more family benefits (as a % of GDP), there is relative stability or little differences between cohorts of middle-aged adults in levels of loneliness and there is overall stability in within-person changes in loneliness (A). In contrast, in nations that invest less in family benefits (as a % of GDP), later-born cohorts of middle-aged adults report higher levels of loneliness (i.e., Early Boomers, Late Boomers, and Gen X, relative to the Silent Generation) and stronger within-person increases in loneliness (B). 1-year age increments.

Conversely, in nations that invest less in family benefits (as a % of GDP), later-born cohorts of middle-aged women (D), compared to men (B), report higher levels of loneliness (i.e., Early Boomers, Late Boomers, and Gen X, relative to the Silent Generation) and stronger within-person increases in loneliness.</p></div>

The long thin lines for each generation represent the age trends and the short-thick lines for each cohort represent within-person changes over 5 years with 1year age increments. In nations with less income inequality, for both men and women, there is relative stability or little differences between cohorts of middle-aged adults in levels of loneliness and there is stability in within-person changes in loneliness (B and D). In contrast, in nations with more income inequality, later-born cohorts of middle-aged men and women report higher levels of loneliness (i.e., Early Boomers, Late Boomers, and Gen X, relative to the Silent Generation) and stronger within-person increases in loneliness (A and C).</p></div>			</div>
