<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Despite the benefits of advance care planning to patients' quality of life and end of life, completion rates remain modest in the United States. This mixed methods study explores adults' perspectives on advance care planning and the potential use of artificial intelligence chatbots to facilitate this process. Using an exploratory design, we surveyed 203 adults, including individuals 18 and older living with life-limiting illnesses (n = 75) and individuals 50 and older who identified as healthy (n = 128). Across the full sample, participants were 64.02 years old (SD = 11.09); 48.8% men, 48.3% women, 2.5% other gender identity; and 55.7% disabled.</p><p>Participants represented diverse racial, socioeconomic, and religious backgrounds, and most had given consideration to end-of-life care. Findings revealed some openness to engaging with chatbots to facilitate advance care planning, particularly for logistical or informational tasks.</p><p>However, for advance care planning conversations of a more personal or emotional nature, participants strongly preferred human communication characterized by empathy and trust, qualities they felt chatbots currently lack. Participants' comfort with chatbot-facilitated advance care planning increased when chatbots were portrayed as transparent, were text-based, and were used in conjunction with healthcare providers. Ultimately, while chatbots may serve as supportive tools in advance care planning, their design must prioritize transparency and human integration to gain broader acceptance. These findings underscore the continued primacy of human connection in end-of-life planning and highlight the conditions under which artificial intelligence chatbots may responsibly supplement, but not replace, this process.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The question of how individuals wish to be cared for at the end of life (EOL) is fundamentally one of dignity, autonomy, and respect for personal values. Despite broad consensus on the ethical imperative to honor individuals' preferences <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> , in some cases such preferences are not honored, compromising quality of care and the overall patient and family experience during the final stages of life. Approximately 13-21% of patients in the United States receive EOL care that is inconsistent with their expressed values, for example with respect to treatment (e.g., life extension versus comfort care) and preferred place of death. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> Advance care planning (ACP) practices are intended to prevent such harms. ACP refers to practices and processes related to clarifying and communicating decisions about the care an individual prefers to receive at EOL, particularly in the event they become incapacitated. ACP includes formal and informal conversations as well as medical and legal documentation. A patient's documentation of their values and treatment goals through an advance directive, for example, increases the likelihood that patient will receive their desired care at EOL. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> Unfortunately, fewer than one in three adults in the United States has completed an advance directive. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> At its best, the goal of ACP is to ensure that the medical, spiritual, and psychological care a person receives throughout the duration of an illness or at EOL is in line with their personal values, goals, and preferences. Both the process of engaging in ACP and the tangible outcomes of ACP reduce stress and decisional burden on family and loved ones <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> and improve satisfaction with care and bereavement outcomes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> ACP is associated with reducing unnecessary hospitalizations and aggressive treatments, increasing use of palliative and hospice services, and lowering healthcare costs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> Brown et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> analyzed data from nearly five million patients with chronic neurodegenerative diseases and found that patients who had documented ACP discussions experienced 20-30% reductions in emergency department visits, and patients who previously showed increasing rates of emergency room visits and hospitalizations began to show declining rates after ACP documentation. Despite these benefits, rates of engagement in ACP conversations in the United States remains low <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> and there is room for ACP to be made more effective.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Low ACP Rates and Areas for ACP Improvement</head><p>Patients report avoiding ACP discussions for many reasons, including emotional discomfort with EOL topics, a lack of knowledge about ACP, and concerns about harming the provider-patient relationship. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> Physicians also sometimes hesitate to initiate ACP conversations out of concern that such discussions could cause emotional distress, diminish a patient's sense of hope, or feel inappropriate in certain clinical contexts. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> Both patients and providers approach conversations related to EOL with verbal and non-verbal cues indicating the topic is extremely sensitive, and tend to use language replete with ambiguity. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> In addition, ACP does not always result in tangible products that provide evidence for what treatments a patient would prefer when they are no longer capable of communicating for themselves, such as advance directives and the assignment of healthcare proxies. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> Current ACP processes and tools tend to be simplistic, emphasizing a binary view of completion versus non-completion of legal documents-rather than regular revisiting of one's goals and preferences-and a narrow set of decisions related to opting in or out of life-extending treatments. Therefore, ACP documents may be outdated, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> ambiguous or lacking in practical details, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> or unintentionally restrict surrogates' flexibility in responding to unforeseen circumstances. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> Finally, completed advance directives may simply fail to reflect a person's true values, goals, and healthcare preferences because they prioritize specific treatment decisions over broader conversations about values and decision-making processes. These varied problems highlight the great potential improved ACP processes could bring to EOL outcomes, underscoring the need to find new avenues for facilitating effective, dynamic ACP conversations and producing personalized documentation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Can ACP Be Improved With the Help of AI Chatbots?</head><p>Researchers and healthcare professionals have developed self-guided ACP aids in easyto-follow formats such as conversation booklets, video tutorials, and even card games in order to reduce emotional discomfort, simplify complex topics, and encourage meaningful dialogue about EOL preferences. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> Such tools have demonstrated effectiveness in motivating individuals to move beyond intention and take real action-for example, after engaging with an ACP card game, up to 75% of participants took concrete ACP-related actions such as discussing their wishes with family or appointing a healthcare proxy. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> However, one of the key limitations of these ACP aids is their static nature: they offer broad, predetermined scripts and cannot adapt in real time to the user's emotions, preferences, or readiness to engage.</p><p>In contrast, artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots have the capacity to produce a fluid, responsive conversation with adjustments in tone, pacing, and content based on user input, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> allowing for a more personalized and supportive experience. Chatbots are computer-based systems designed to replicate human dialogue through text, voice, or multimedia interactions.</p><p>With recent advancements in AI and digital technologies, their capabilities have significantly expanded and are now widely applied in diverse healthcare settings. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> Related research in the realm of ACP is rapidly evolving, but some suggests patients may be especially willing to engage with chatbots on sensitive topics 27 like EOL care. In addition, chatbots have the potential to address existing barriers to ACP: lack of time in healthcare appointments, limited access to providers, and lack of EOL and ACP knowledge. New AI chatbot ACP tools would presumably be accessible to patients at any time or day, be free or low-cost for patients, and be equipped to provide basic and advanced information about EOL care and ACP according to patients' needs.</p><p>Early research with AI chatbots in the context of palliative care demonstrates such tools can be effective in dispelling misconceptions, improving patient awareness and education, and producing human-like conversation resembling meaningful dialogue. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> This research has also revealed certain limitations, such as chatbots' excessive repetition of phrases as well as expressions of strong, potentially inappropriate opinions on sensitive topics like religion, death, and the afterlife. Palliative care experts have also raised concerns about AI chatbots being positioned as replacements for human interaction, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> which could progressively weaken and ultimately diminish the patient-provider relationships which are fundamental to effective medical practice. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> Laypeople are concerned about privacy and security in AI chatbots conversations. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> Finally, there are concerns about the potential for biased chatbots, which could lead to the potential harm of marginalized groups if not moderated efficiently. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> Though the use of AI chatbots in this sensitive context presents challenges, given that decades of research seeking to improve ACP have made only marginal gains <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> innovative approaches are needed. Seeking input from potential users is an important first step.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Purpose of the Present Study</head><p>The present study contributes to the existing literature on ACP communication by seeking to understand U. S.-dwelling adults' openness to AI chatbot integration in ACP conversations. Chatbots are already being implemented as a communication aid in other healthcare settings <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> and are currently being assessed for its implementation in the ACP communication process. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> However, there is no present literature on patients' perspectives on communicating with AI chatbots in the emotionally sensitive context of EOL care, nor on their imagined preferences for such communication.</p><p>In response to this literature gap, we surveyed two demographic groups we believed would have given some consideration to EOL care preferences and ACP. The first group was comprised of adults over the age of 18 who self-identified as having a life-limiting illness, or a medical condition that cannot be cured and is expected to significantly shorten lifespan and/or reduce quality of life, as such individuals may be more likely to have considered care preferences and mortality. We also surveyed adults over the age of 50 who may not identify as having a lifelimiting illness, as age is associated with increased awareness of mortality. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref> Our primary objective was to assess participants' general perceptions of and attitudes toward the integration of AI chatbots in ACP with the aim of identifying barriers and opportunities for this application.</p><p>Our secondary objective was to gather participant input that could inform the future development of ACP AI chatbot technology designed to support individuals in identifying and communicating their care preferences.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participant Recruitment</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria</head><p>To be eligible, individuals had to be able to read and respond to the survey in English and to currently reside in the United States for at least one year. Adults who identified as living with a life-limiting illness ("LLI")-living with a serious, terminal, or progressive condition such as cancer, organ failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or neurological disorders-had to be at least 18 years old. Adults who identified as not living with an LLI ("healthy") had to be at least 50 years old. Survey respondents were included in the present sample if they completed at least 95% of the survey.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample</head><p>A total of 203 participants were included in the sample. Of these, 128 adults ranging from 50-83 years old identified as healthy and 75 adults ranging from 22-84 years old identified as having an LLI. Sample characteristics such as gender, race, and other demographic variables are displayed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Survey Measure</head><p>The questions analyzed in the present study were collected as part of a larger survey examining preferences, concerns, desires, expectations, and beliefs related to EOL care, ACP communication and documentation, and AI chatbots. Each section included multiple-choice and open-ended questions, prompting both quantitative and qualitative responses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure</head><p>Eligible participants were directed to a Qualtrics consent form and survey hosted on the University at Buffalo's secure platform. The full survey was estimated to take approximately 20-30 minutes to complete. Participants had the option to skip questions and, in some cases, choose multiple responses. Participants were given the option to opt into a drawing for one of 10 digital rewards of $25 at survey close.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analyses</head><p>The study employed an exploratory design involving a self-administered online survey; we did not make hypotheses. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize participant responses.</p><p>When appropriate, group comparisons between healthy adults and adults with LLI were conducted using t-tests and chi-square tests. Of note, group differences are noted in Results only when statistically significant. All quantitative analyses were performed in R. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40</ref> Qualitative thematic analysis was conducted on the open-ended responses to the survey to identify patterns, themes, and key insights. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41</ref> Themes were generated from analyzing the data, and coding and recoding was performed to ensure reliability and validity in response interpretation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Descriptive Statistics</head><p>As displayed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>, the sample included an even distribution of men and women.</p><p>Most participants identified as White and as heterosexual. The sample was religiously diverse, with Christianity best represented. The sample was more educated than the general U. S. population, 42 with nearly half holding a graduate degree. The healthy group was significantly older (M = 65.42, SD = 8.50) than the LLI group (M = 61.60, SD = 13.70), t(107.95) = 2.18, p = .031, d = 0.36 and fewer healthy participants identified as having a disability or chronic condition, χ²(1, N = 203) = 39.20, p &lt; .001, Cramer's V = 0.44. In addition, financial situation differed significantly by group, χ²(2, N = 203) = 20.37, p &lt; .001, Cramer's V = 0.32; participants with LLI more often reported financial difficulties and healthy participants more often reported having more than enough money for necessities and luxuries. Finally, healthy participants were more likely to have completed college or graduate degrees than participants with LLI, χ²(2, N = 203) = 9.51, p = .009, Cramer's V = 0.22.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>EOL Care Consideration</head><p>A substantial portion of participants indicated they had given their future EOL care at least some thought, with 85.5% selecting either somewhat or quite a bit of thought. A chi-square test of independence revealed a significant association between group and the extent to which participants had thought about their EOL care, χ²(2, N = 203) = 6.33, p = .042, Cramer's V = 0.18. Participants in the LLI group were more likely to report having thought about it quite a bit (41.3%) compared with the healthy group (33.6%) and were less likely to report having thought about EOL care not at all (6.7%) compared to the healthy group (19.5%).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Perspectives on AI Integration Into Healthcare and ACP</head><p>Slightly more than half of the sample (58.9%) had previously interacted with a chatbot.</p><p>Participants were asked, "In what healthcare contexts do you think a chatbot could provide accurate information?" prompting yes/no ratings of 11 categories of health-related support. As illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>, AI chatbots were perceived as having the potential accuracy in situations such as helping users find treatment locations or prepare questions for medical appointments.</p><p>However, when it came to more complex tasks such as diagnosing conditions based on symptoms and providing emotional support, chatbots were viewed as less accurate, for example endorsing "Providing me with comfort and emotional support" significantly less frequently than would be expected if all options were equally likely to be chosen, χ²(1, N = 836) = 36.91, p &lt; .001, Cramer's V = 0.21. The only significant difference between LLI and healthy groups was for the item "Helping me find the right specialist," χ²(1, N = 203) = 4.26, p = .039, Cramer's V = .15, such that LLI participants were more likely than healthy participants to trust a chatbot with this task.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Openness to the Use of AI Chatbots in ACP</head><p>Participants were asked about their openness to communicating with a chatbot for the  <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>. Overall, participants expressed curiosity about chatbot conversations as well as concerns regarding patient privacy and chatbot bias. Participants often expressed they believed chatbots were severely limited with regard to providing emotional support. However, even those participants who preferred human interaction tended to acknowledged that chatbots could bridge gaps in access when human support is unavailable or ineffective.</p><p>Participants were also asked if they would prefer to have conversations about ACP virtually with a chatbot, or in person with a medical professional. The majority preferred a medical professional (73.9%). Only 7.4% preferred a chatbot; 23.6% selected I'm not sure or have no preference. Participants were also prompted to explain their reasoning behind their choice. In their open-ended explanations, participants who selected medical professionals emphasized the importance of expertise and believed professionals were better equipped to handle emotionally challenging ACP conversations. As one participant explained: Advance care planning is a sensitive topic and should include the care of a human being who can hold space for the depth of emotions and complexity of humanity in the conversation. An unfeeling robot cannot provide the psychological, mental, or emotional touch necessary for these types of conversations.</p><p>A few participants described having a trusting and valued relationship with their healthcare provider: "I…have a very caring and compassionate [primary care provider] that I believe would give me true and accurate information, especially since he has been my physician for over 10 years." In one notable case, a participant clarified that while they preferred to converse with a medical professional, this choice was likely unrealistic due to concerns about the fragility of the healthcare system: Some participants who selected not sure described the complexity contained within the choice, for example, pointing to a desire for the conversation partner-whether a medical professional or a chatbot-to "understand what is involved with your particular medical condition because generic, one size fits all answers would be frustrating…It could be awkward or uncomfortable discussing such things in person, especially with a professional who doesn't really know you." Some said that their choice depended on the situation: "I think the choice would have to do with the urgency of need to have the discussion and the type of info needed to pass between me and the provider." Others were simply "open to discuss[ing] advance care with anyone, even [a] chatbot."</p><p>A small proportion of participants preferred a chatbot. These participants believed that a chatbot would provide a private and non-judgmental environment ("No judgement by bot on silly questions or repeat questions. The bot does not act like [it's too] busy or [you're] bothering</p><p>[them]") or be more accessible and available than providers ("I don't think medical professionals have time for things like [ACP conversations]"). Overall, a portion of the respondents who selected no preference or a chatbot preference believed that chatbots could potentially fulfill psychosocial and practical needs they perceived as unlikely to be met through interaction with medical providers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Preferred Characteristics of an ACP AI Chatbot</head><p>Participants were asked to rate their comfort with a potential chatbot interaction based on six key scenarios: a) "I can have a phone conversation with the chatbot"; b) "I can have a text conversation with the chatbot (typing on a cell phone or computer)"; c) "If my doctor told me they trust and recommend the chatbot"; d) "If my doctor told me we would have a follow-up face-to-face conversation based on my chatbot conversation"; e) "The chatbot states right away that it is a chatbot"; f) "The chatbot implies they are a real, live person."</p><p>As displayed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>, participant comfort levels varied across scenarios. In the phone conversation scenario, the majority of participants reported feeling either neither comfortable nor uncomfortable, somewhat uncomfortable, or extremely uncomfortable. In contrast, the text conversation scenario led to an approximately normal distribution centered around the neutral midpoint. Interestingly, when a doctor recommended and trusted the chatbot, participants were only nudged somewhat toward increased comfort. However, the promise of a face-to-face follow-up with a doctor resulted in increased comfort levels, with 62.0% of participants feeling either somewhat comfortable or extremely comfortable. Finally, when the chatbot implied it was a real person, the majority (74.4%) of participants felt either extremely uncomfortable or somewhat uncomfortable, whereas only 20.7% of participants were extremely uncomfortable or somewhat uncomfortable when the chatbot was transparent about being an AI agent. To summarize, transparency about the chatbot's nature, as well as meaningful doctor involvement, plays a crucial role in enhancing participant comfort.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>The purpose of this study was to explore adults' beliefs about AI chatbot integration into the ACP process. We analyzed responses from 203 participants, including 128 who identified as healthy and 75 who identified as living with an LLI. Participants across both groups represented a range of racial, religious, and socioeconomic backgrounds. Most participants had given at least some thought to their own EOL care, with those identifying as having an LLI more likely to have considered it in depth. Additionally, more than half of the sample reported prior experience interacting with an AI chatbot, suggesting a baseline familiarity with the technology relevant to the study's focus.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Utility of AI in Healthcare and ACP</head><p>We first examined participant beliefs about the use of AI chatbots in healthcare broadly.</p><p>Participants endorsed the use of chatbots for emotional support significantly less often than the other categories. While we note that there may have been some variability in participants' interpretations of the meaning of "accuracy" with regard to emotional support, participants openended responses indicated they tended not to view AI as well-suited to providing comfort or empathy in medical settings. This finding reinforces existing concerns about technological dehumanization in healthcare <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> and suggests that while chatbots may be viewed as useful for logistical or informational tasks, they are not perceived as appropriate substitutes for emotional or relational aspects of health communication. The only significant group difference was in the domain of specialist referrals, where participants with an LLI were more likely than healthy participants to believe that a chatbot could help them find the right specialist. This difference may reflect the LLI group's more frequent navigation of the healthcare system and use of specialist care, however, we note that due to the number of group comparisons made we interpret this result with caution.</p><p>Participants' views of using AI chatbots for ACP specifically also reflected both openness and ambivalence. Some participants were curious or cautiously optimistic, highlighting AI's ability to offer general information, guide reflection, and improve access to planning tools.</p><p>A few mentioned chatbots' potential to reduce human bias or judgment, appreciating the objectivity AI might bring to sensitive conversations. Others pointed to chatbots' convenience and scalability, especially in situations where human support is limited. However, not all participants were open to the idea of AI integration into ACP. Participants voiced doubts about the accuracy and reliability of chatbot-generated content and questioned whether such tools could adequately address the emotional, ethical, and contextual complexity of ACP communication. Preference for human connection and emotional support was a recurring theme, with some respondents asserting that chatbots lack the empathy, nuance, and understanding required for meaningful ACP conversations. One participant provided a concise summary of a perspective expressed by many: I would be somewhat open to chatting with a chatbot for learning about end-of-life care and clarifying my values around advance care planning. A chatbot could provide helpful general information, prompt reflection, and offer resources. However, I would prefer to discuss deeply personal or complex concerns with a human professional, as these topics require empathy, nuance, and individualized guidance.</p><p>Concerns about data safety and privacy were also prevalent, particularly regarding how information might be shared or exploited by corporations. Several participants expressed discomfort with the motives driving AI development, citing fears of corporate greed, costcutting, and the dehumanization of healthcare. As one participant starkly put it: I know the corporate world is trying to save money and boost the profits of the one percent and corporate owners, but I wish not to play their games and live in the world controlled by software. I would prefer to speak with a real human being on matters such as life and end of life care.</p><p>These findings suggest that while some users are open to experimenting with AI in ACP contexts, many are not convinced that the technology is ready, or appropriate, for such deeply human matters-as one participant wrote, "What does a chatbot know about life?"</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Role of Health Care Providers</head><p>Our findings underscore the central role that healthcare providers continue to play in ACP communication. Nearly three-quarters of participants indicated a preference for in-person ACP conversations with a medical professional versus an AI chatbot, citing trust in their healthcare provider's expertise and a strong desire for emotional support. Participants who were neutral or unsure about their preference tended to recognize the benefits and limitations of both human and AI-facilitated conversations, indicating their preferences would depend on factors such as medical urgency, provider familiarity, or the complexity of their condition. Some participants noted that longstanding, trusting relationships with their providers made them feel more comfortable discussing their EOL preferences, consistent with research suggesting that patient-provider relationships are fundamental to effective ACP and effective medical practice more broadly. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> Provider-offered ACP consultations have been found to significantly boost advance directive completion rates. One retrospective chart review study found that patients who were directly offered ACP consults ended up completing advance directives at extraordinarily improved rates: 65.9% completion in primary care settings compared with 1% of controls and 28.1% completion in the hematology/oncology setting compared with 3% of controls. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">43</ref> At the same time, some participants who preferred medical providers acknowledged that these ideal patient-provider relationships are not universally accessible. A few responses reflected concerns about limited appointment length, which is a known deterrent to patientinitiated ACP conversations. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> Concerns were also raised about strained provider capacity, and inequitable access to care due to insurance or other systemic barriers. Indeed, among the small subgroup of participants who preferred a chatbot, several cited practical convenience and ease of access as key reasons. Our findings suggest that although healthcare providers may be seen as the gold standard for ACP conversations, structural limitations in healthcare access may require the development of supplemental tools such as AI chatbots if ACP participation rates are to improve.</p><p>Participant responses revealed that comfort with AI chatbots in ACP conversations is highly dependent on the context of the interaction and the chatbot's transparency. Participants were especially open to chatbot interactions when a face-to-face follow-up physician encounter was promised. Transparency also played a pivotal role: participants were very uncomfortable when the chatbot implied it was a real person and most comfortable when it clearly identified itself as a chatbot, which may be related to participants' preference for text-based over voicebased chatbot interactions. Together, these results suggest that human oversight is critical for chatbot acceptability and that human imitation is particularly off-putting. ACP AI chatbot tool development in this context must therefore incorporate input by healthcare providers, <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">44</ref> language training produces emotionally attuned and empathetic language <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">45</ref> and incorporates bias mitigation language, and strong cybersecurity protocols. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">46</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study Strengths and Limitations</head><p>We successfully recruited participants who had given some thought to EOL care preferences and had some exposure to AI chatbots, supporting the appropriateness of the target participant groups. We did not recruit adults 18-49 without LLI and only eight participants with LLI under age 50 participated, limiting our ability to generalize to adults under age 50. In addition, this survey was administered online via a Qualtrics survey, which means participation required a basic level of digital literacy. While this was helpful in our goal of recruiting an audience with exposure to AI, those who lack internet access or struggle with using technology may have been excluded. Our sample was diverse across several domains, including a balance of men and women, a strong representation from those with federally-administered insurance, and some notable diversity within race, religion, and income levels. Nonetheless, these latter groups were not sizable enough to conduct group comparisons, which will be important in future research given that preferences for virtual healthcare assistance may vary by identity characteristics such as race. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">47</ref> We were also limited in our ability to generalize our findings to individuals from some racial groups (e.g., Asian, Middle Eastern), with minoritized gender identities, with low educational attainment, struggling with financial insecurity, or without insurance, all of whom often face greater barriers in EOL equity. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">48</ref> These factors should be considered when interpreting the findings and their implications for broader ACP and AI chatbot implementation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Practice Implications</head><p>The responsible integration of AI chatbots into ACP could improve engagement, completion, and quality of ACP. Chatbots are not constrained by time as human providers are and may therefore enable increased ACP engagement at patients' preferred time, duration, and pace. AI chatbots have access to tremendous knowledge bases and could provide education tailored to individuals' needs, offer key questions for consideration, and elicit details not feasibly generated in a brief patient-provider encounter. Further, as the worldwide populace ages, those with lifelong exposure to digital generative AI tools are increasingly likely to expect its presence in healthcare throughout their lives. Indeed, AI is rapidly being integrated into healthcare communication, at a rate likely outpacing empirically-based best practices to inform its development and deployment. Not only is there no prior research on patients' views of the potential for AI chatbots to facilitate ACP communication, but there is also relatively little conversation analytic research on human provider-patient communication on ACP on which to build. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> Continued research on human and AI-assisted ACP communication is imperative.</p><p>Establishing foundational knowledge about potential users' preferences when the technology is still nascent increases the likelihood that such tools will be developed with crucial user input.</p><p>This study highlights the complex perspectives that adults hold regarding the integration of AI in ACP conversations. Participants across both healthy and LLI groups recognized the potential utility of AI chatbots in ACP, particularly for increasing access, providing information, and guiding reflection, but conveyed substantial skepticism about AI chatbots' ability to replace the emotional depth, empathy, and contextual awareness provided by human professionals. The central role of healthcare providers in ACP remains clear, yet structural barriers in the healthcare system point to a space where thoughtfully designed AI tools could serve as a supportive bridge or supplement to human care. For AI chatbots to gain acceptance in such sensitive domains, program design must reflect a deep understanding of emotional nuance, prioritize transparency, and function in partnership with human providers rather than in place of them. Future work should focus on co-designing AI ACP tools with input from diverse users to ensure they align with the psychological, ethical, and relational needs of patients navigating EOL decisions. Note. All variables were self-reported. The percentages are of the total number of participants who responded to the given question.</p></div>
