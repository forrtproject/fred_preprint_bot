<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Information technology (IT) projects continue to experience high rates of failure, budget overruns, and benefit shortfalls. Decades of empirical and practitioner studies identify "uncertainty" as one of the most persistent causes of risk <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Lyytinen et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Wallace et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr">Tiwana &amp; Keil, 2004</ref>). Yet, the term uncertainty remains conceptually diffuse and operationally underdeveloped. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Sambamurthy and Zmud (2017)</ref> proposed a compelling and practice-aligned model that frames IT project uncertainty along two dimensions: <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> the clarity or ambiguity of project deliverable specifications and (2) the number, diversity, and power of stakeholders who influence project outcomes. According to this model, projects characterized by ambiguous deliverables and complex stakeholder structures exhibit higher levels of uncertainty, which in turn heightens project risk.</p><p>While their framework provides a clear conceptual foundation, it remains largely pedagogical -introduced in their book Guiding the Digital Transformation of Organizations -and has not yet been elaborated or validated in the academic literature. This paper seeks to extend that model by defining the constructs, grounding them in established theories, and linking them explicitly to project risk outcomes.</p><p>The central premise is that reducing uncertainty reduces risk. Clarifying deliverable specifications and managing stakeholder structure structure complexity are therefore not administrative niceties, but core mechanisms of de-risking IT projects. The research question motivating this study is:</p><p>How do deliverable specification clarity and stakeholder structure complexity jointly influence IT project risk?</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">THEORETICAL BACKGROUND</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">IT Project Risk and Uncertainty</head><p>Risk in IT projects is commonly defined as the likelihood and impact of adverse events affecting project objectives <ref type="bibr">(Barki et al., 1993)</ref>. Uncertainty, by contrast, refers to the lack of clarity or predictability regarding those objectives and events. In project management research, uncertainty is viewed as a precursor to risk: ambiguous or unstable conditions increase the probability of negative outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Chapman &amp; Ward, 2003)</ref>.</p><p>IT projects, particularly large-scale digital transformation initiatives, operate under high uncertainty because deliverables evolve alongside emerging technologies and shifting organizational needs. Requirements often remain partially specified or contested across stakeholder groups, creating fertile ground for scope creep, design rework, and schedule delays.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">The Sambamurthy-Zmud Model of Project Uncertainty</head><p>Sambamurthy and Zmud (2017) position IT project uncertainty within a two-dimensional framework:</p><p>1. Clarity vs. Ambiguity in Deliverable Specifications -the degree to which project outputs are well-defined and understood.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Number / Diversity of Stakeholders</head><p>-the structural complexity of the stakeholder environment influencing the project.</p><p>Projects with high ambiguity and high stakeholder structure complexity are expected to experience the greatest uncertainty and therefore the highest risk. This framework offers a powerful lens for examining project failure causes but has not been translated into measurable constructs or empirically validated.</p><p>This paper advances the model by defining each dimension operationally and theorizing their interaction through established organizational theories.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">THEORETICAL FOUNDATIONS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Information Processing Theory (Galbraith, 1973)</head><p>Organizations must process information to resolve uncertainty. The amount of information processing required increases with task ambiguity and interdependence. Deliverable specification clarity reduces the need for information processing; ambiguity increases it.</p><p>Projects overloaded with unprocessed information are more prone to coordination failure and risk.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Stakeholder Theory (Freeman, 1984; Mitchell, Agle &amp; Wood, 1997)</head><p>Projects involve multiple stakeholders with varying salience (power, legitimacy, urgency). As stakeholder diversity and power asymmetry increase, alignment becomes harder, leading to contested interpretations of deliverables. This misalignment magnifies the impact of specification ambiguity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Socio-Technical Systems Theory</head><p>Projects succeed when the technical (specifications, systems, methods) and social (stakeholders, governance, communication) subsystems are aligned. Misalignment-such as ambiguous deliverables coupled with fragmented stakeholder interests-creates systemic project risk.</p><p>Together, these theories help explain how ambiguity and stakeholder structure complexity interact to produce risk through elevated information processing demands, goal misalignment, and socio-technical imbalance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">CONCEPTUAL MODEL</head><p>The proposed model conceptualizes IT Project Risk as an outcome of IT Project Uncertainty, which emerges from the interaction between deliverable specification clarity (DSC) and stakeholder structure complexity (SSC). When DSC is low (ambiguous deliverables), projects face greater risk due to misinterpretation of what actually needs to be delivered. When SSC is high (large number of stakeholders, or stakeholders representing varying interests / parts of the organization), coordination challenges / meeting competing needs of stakeholders amplify the impact of any deliverable ambiguity. Thus SSC by itself is not of significance, the moderating impact of SSC on DSC is relevant. Conversely, high DSC and low SSC conditions yield lower uncertainty and reduced project risk.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">CONSTRUCT DEFINITIONS AND OPERATIONALIZATION</head><p>This section defines the key constructs underpinning the model of IT project uncertainty adapted from Sambamurthy &amp; Zmud (2017). Following their proposition that uncertainty in project deliverable specifications and stakeholder structure complexity increase IT project risk, we expand each construct and provide preliminary operationalization guidance for empirical testing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Project Deliverable Specifications Definition</head><p>Project deliverable specifications (also referred to plainly as deliverables) are the formal outputs that define what an IT project must produce to achieve its intended outcomes. In an IT project, each project deliverable serves a particular purpose that aids in achieving project objectives in some form or another; and there may be relationships between deliverables such that one deliverable informs or is a prerequisite for another. Each deliverable typically comprises different content required to satisfy the objectives of that particular deliverable. For example project charter deliverables may detail a set of decisions about project scope, functional design specifications may include descriptions of how the system functionality will be set up, and data design deliverables describe decisions about what data will be migrated from the old system to the new system being implemented in the project. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Operationalization of Deliverable Specification Clarity (DSC)</head><p>Deliverable Specification Clarity (DSC) is conceptualized as a multi-dimensional construct comprising perceived clarity, documented ambiguity, and contextual interpretation. To assess this construct in the context of IT projects, three complementary components are proposed: the Deliverable Clarity Index (DCI), the Ambiguity Ratio (AR-0), and Qualitative Indicators (QI).</p><p>Each serves a distinct yet reinforcing analytical role.</p><p>Deliverable Clarity Index (DCI) is a qualitative composite indicator measuring how clear, complete, specific, and consistent key project deliverables are in the eyes of project participants. It reflects the shared understanding of deliverables among project participants. DCI can be measured as a mean of Likert-scale survey responses (1-5) on items assessing core deliverables listed in Appendix A (e.g., project charter, requirements, data, integration, training, change management). Data for DCI can be gathered by surveying project team members, business stakeholders, and system integrators.</p><p>The Initial Ambiguity Ratio (AR-0) can be seen as a diagnostic indicator quantifying the extent of unresolved, conflicting, or incomplete elements in deliverable documentation. It captures "objective" ambiguity present in project artefacts. This is a quantitative indicator counting ambiguous, conflicting, or incomplete items ÷ total documented items. AR-0 data can be gathered through project requirements logs, issue trackers, meeting minutes and design documentation. Gaps in AR-0 can manifest if a deliverable has never been developed in the project in the first place and hence does not show up as a denominator in the "incomplete items ÷ total documented items" AR-0 calculation. Similarly, if the deliverable is developed but is missing important content which project participants do not realize, these ambiguities are never documented in the issue tracker, meeting minutes etc. and may not show up in the numerator of "incomplete items ÷ total documented items" AR-0 calculation.</p><p>Qualitative Indicators (QI) are thematic and narrative evidence providing contextual understanding of how clarity or ambiguity manifests in practice. It explains the why behind DCI and AR values. Measures include thematic coding of qualitative data to identify instances of misunderstanding, rework, or disagreement regarding deliverables. Interviews, project retrospectives, industry expertise and lessons-learned documentation are potential data sources. QI can be used to compensate for potential data gaps in AR-0 described above.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Integration of DSC Components</head><p>DCI, AR-0 and QI components are not redundant but rather complementary, leading to an overall Ambiguity Ratio (AR). DCI provides a subjective perception of clarity across stakeholders whilst AR-0 offers an initial objective documentation-based measure of ambiguity. QI supplies contextual insight, explaining patterns and relationships observed in DCI and AR-0. QI also allows for consideration of relevant project deliverables which may not have been developed at all in a particular project, or which may have been developed but are missing important deliverable content and such deficiencies do not show up in DCI or AR-0 assessments.</p><p>Together, AR enables both quantitative assessment and qualitative interpretation of how clearly deliverables are defined and communicated within IT projects. Using both perceptual (DCI, QI) and empirical (AR-0) measures aligns with mixed-methods approaches in IS research <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Venkatesh et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Mertens, 2015)</ref>. This triangulation ensures construct validity and enables multi-perspective understanding-critical in complex, multi-stakeholder IT environments where clarity is socially constructed and often evolves dynamically (Lyytinen &amp; Newman, 2008; Turner &amp; Cochrane, 1993).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Stakeholder Characteristics</head><p>Stakeholders are individuals or groups with a direct interest in or influence over project deliverables, and by extension, the overall realization of intended project outcomes. Their number and diversity shape the level of uncertainty during project execution <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(McKeen &amp; Smith, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Lyytinen &amp; Hirschheim, 1987)</ref>. We distinguish core stakeholders (those defining, approving, or directly impacted by deliverables) from peripheral stakeholders (those indirectly affected but not influential in specification clarity).</p><p>The number of stakeholders can be defined as the count of distinct core stakeholders and stakeholder groups directly involved in shaping project deliverables. Risks introduced by the number of stakeholders include coordination overload, increased communication noise, amount of effort required for training and change management. These risks can be measured and potentially mitigated by using stakeholder analysis, communication network density metrics and change impact assessments (Mitchell, Agle &amp; Wood (1997); <ref type="bibr">Barki &amp; Hartwick (2001)</ref>).</p><p>Diversity of stakeholders is another dimension of SSC <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Sambamurthy and Zmud, 2017)</ref>. This can be seen as the degree of heterogeneity in the core stakeholders' functional role in the business, their desired project outcomes, their desire or time available to participate in project activities, competing priorities, culture, geography, or cognition. Misaligned frames of reference and conflicting decision logics are some of the risks that diverse stakeholders introduce. These risks can be measured and mitigated through stakeholder diversity index assessments (Shannon index), alignment workshops and running shared understanding sessions <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Reich &amp; Benbasat (2000)</ref>; Martinsuo &amp; Hoverfält (2018)).</p><p>Sambamurthy and Zmud (2017) also include power as a dimension of stakeholder structure complexity. Power is excluded from this initial operational model due to its conceptual and measurement complexity but remains a critical area for future exploration <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Mitchell et al., 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Aaltonen &amp; Kujala, 2010)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Operationalization of Stakeholder Structure Complexity (SSC)</head><p>Stakeholder Complexity Index (SCI) can be defined as the weighted composite measure of number of stakeholders × diversity of stakeholders. SCI can be informed by both qualitative and quantitative data sources.</p><p>Qualitative data sources informing include stakeholder maps, governance records, and meeting transcripts coded for influence, conflict, and alignment patterns. Quantitative measures can be adapted from scales from <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Reich &amp; Benbasat (2000)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Barki &amp; Hartwick (2001)</ref> for evaluating stakeholder alignment and communication quality.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">PROPOSED ANALYTICAL MODEL AND HYPOTHESES</head><p>Building on Sambamurthy and Zmud's (2017) conceptualization of IT project uncertainty, this study proposes a model in which deliverable ambiguity and stakeholder structure complexity jointly influence project risk. Specifically, project risk (PR) is modeled as a function of the Ambiguity Ratio (AR), the Stakeholder Complexity Index (SCI), and their interaction:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">PR = β0 + β1(AR) + β2(SCI) + β3(AR×SCI) + ε</formula><p>Interpretation of the Model 1. β₀ represents the baseline level of project risk when both ambiguity and stakeholder structure complexity are minimal. 2. β₁ captures the direct effect of ambiguity in project deliverable specifications on project risk. 3. β₂ captures the direct effect of stakeholder structure complexity-defined by the number, diversity, and power of stakeholders-on project risk. 4. β₃ represents the interaction effect, indicating whether the risk impact of ambiguity becomes stronger (or weaker) as stakeholder structure complexity increases. 5. ε captures all other sources of project risk not explained by ambiguity or stakeholder structure complexity (random noise, unmeasured variables, etc.).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theoretical Rationale</head><p>Ambiguity in project deliverable specifications creates uncertainty in scope, requirements, and expected outcomes, which elevates the likelihood of rework, schedule delays, and misalignment between business and technical teams ( When both ambiguity and stakeholder structure complexity are high, their joint influence is expected to compound project uncertainty, creating an environment where clarity deteriorates faster than mitigation mechanisms can respond.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hypotheses H1: Deliverable ambiguity (AR) is positively associated with project risk (PR).</head><p>Projects with more ambiguous deliverables will experience higher levels of perceived and realized risk.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H2: Stakeholder complexity (SCI) is positively associated with project risk (PR).</head><p>Projects involving a greater number, diversity, or power imbalance among stakeholders will face higher levels of project risk.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H3: Stakeholder complexity moderates the relationship between deliverable ambiguity and project risk (AR × SCI).</head><p>The positive effect of ambiguity on project risk will be stronger when stakeholder structure complexity is high.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODOLOGICAL PATHWAYS</head><p>A multi-method research strategy is recommended to test the hypotheses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Phase 1: Construct Development</head><p>Conduct a Delphi study with experienced IT project managers and architects to validate construct dimensions and generate measurable indicators for deliverable specification clarity and stakeholder structure complexity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Phase 2: Survey Study</head><p>Administer a cross-sectional survey across multiple organizations. Use validated scales or newly developed measures to test the hypothesized relationships using regression or SEM.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Phase 3: Case Studies</head><p>Complement quantitative findings with qualitative case studies of large digital transformation projects to understand mechanisms in context.</p><p>Potential dependent variables include cost and schedule performance, requirement change frequency, and stakeholder satisfaction. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Extension of the Sambamurthy-Zmud Model:</head><p>The work extends their framework from conceptual to empirical terrain, contributing to the digital transformation and IT governance literatures.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Governance Implications:</head><p>Suggests that organizations can mitigate risk by dynamically matching governance intensity to levels of deliverable ambiguity and stakeholder structure complexity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9.">DISCUSSION</head><p>This conceptualization reframes IT project uncertainty not as an abstract descriptor but as a riskinducing condition that can be systematically measured and managed. Clarifying deliverables reduces the interpretive latitude available to diverse stakeholders; aligning stakeholders reduces the amplification effect of residual ambiguity.</p><p>Projects often fail not simply because requirements are incomplete, but because uncertainty interacts with stakeholder structure. A moderately ambiguous requirement can be manageable in a cohesive stakeholder environment but catastrophic in a fragmented one. Thus, managing uncertainty is inherently a social as well as a technical challenge. First, this study assumes that the IT project business case-including its anticipated benefitsis well-defined prior to project mobilization. In practice, however, the business case itself may be uncertain or incomplete, thereby introducing additional layers of ambiguity that propagate throughout the project. Future research could therefore examine how uncertainty in the business case influences downstream deliverables and overall project risk. Second, future work should seek to develop granular definitions of ambiguity for each key project deliverable. This may include identifying explicit questions or criteria that a deliverable must answer to be considered "clear" rather than "ambiguous." Establishing such diagnostic checklists could strengthen both theoretical precision and practical applicability.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="10.">FURTHER RESEARCH</head><p>Third, further investigation is needed into the appropriate level of detail required for deliverables to achieve clarity. Greater detail does not necessarily equate to greater clarityparticularly for complex deliverables such as business processes and requirements specifications. Researchers could explore how modeling standards (e.g., BPMN levels L1-L4) and the balance between current state and future state representations affect clarity and alignment among stakeholders. Fourth, the quality dimension of deliverables merits closer attention. Determining what constitutes "adequate quality" for clarity-along with the methods and metrics to assess it-remains an open question. This includes exploring how technical accuracy, completeness, and stakeholder validation jointly contribute to perceived and actual clarity.</p><p>Fifth, IT project deliverables are dynamic and temporal in nature: they evolve as business conditions, technologies, and stakeholder expectations change. Future studies should examine how shifts in context over the project lifecycle alter the clarity-ambiguity balance, and whether adaptive governance mechanisms can mitigate associated risks. Sixth, comparative studies across different project management methodologies-such as waterfall versus agile or hybrid models-could reveal how varying degrees of iteration, documentation, and stakeholder engagement influence the relationship between ambiguity, complexity, and project risk.</p><p>Finally, while the present study excluded stakeholder power from the proposed model due to its conceptual and measurement complexity, Sambamurthy and Zmud (2017) emphasize power as an important dimension of stakeholder influence. Future research should explore how power asymmetries-both formal and informal-shape perceptions of clarity, decision authority, and the ability to manage uncertainty in large-scale IT projects. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Mitchell et al. (1997)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Keil et al. (2013)</ref>; Tiwana (2010) provide useful insights that need to be further explored.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="11.">CONCLUSION</head><p>Uncertainty in project deliverables is a central driver of IT project risk. Building on Sambamurthy and Zmud's (2017) conceptual model, this paper defines and operationalizes two foundational dimensions of uncertainty -deliverable specification clarity and stakeholder structure complexity -and theorizes their joint influence on risk outcomes.</p><p>By positioning uncertainty as a de-risking target, rather than a descriptive variable, the model provides both a theoretical bridge and a managerial toolkit for improving IT project success. Future empirical work can validate these constructs, test the proposed hypotheses, and refine predictive models of digital transformation risk.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
