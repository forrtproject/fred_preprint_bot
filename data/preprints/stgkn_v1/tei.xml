Besides, when considering effect sizes reflecting discrimination abilities, these were more strongly associated with BW in the frontal regions, while in the temporal regions they were more strongly associated to GA.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">Measuring Neural Responses in Newborns: Near-Infrared Spectroscopy</head><p>Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a particularly useful technique to measure newborns' brain responses, specifically the changes in the concentrations of oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin accompanying focal neural activation, underlying complex cognitive processes, such as language acquisition. Therefore, it can enhance the understanding of perceptual and cognitive abilities that are already in place at birth. It is indeed a method of choice for studying newborns and very young infants' abilities by non-invasively measuring changes in the hemodynamic response of the infant brain <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">1</ref> . Newborns and infants have thinner skin, skull and minimal hair, allowing near-infrared light to penetrate deeper into the cortex and reducing noise and artifacts by promoting better contact between the head and the sensors <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[5]</ref> . For these reasons, NIRS is a suitable technique for brain imaging in developmental populations.</p><p>The increasing use of fNIRS in developmental research greatly enhances the possibility to study brain responses to sensory stimuli from the earliest stages of life. Yet, the developmental trajectory of the shape of the hemodynamic response function (HRF) is not fully understood, in particular in the youngest infants when the brain and the neurovascular coupling are the least mature. A critical unanswered question is how the early HRF is shaped by factors such as maturation and prenatal learning. In newborn infants, individual differences in gestational age and birth weight are particularly important, as they are directly associated with overall brain development, functional maturation and later developmental outcomes. Indeed, even within typical development, gestational age and birth weight span a large range. Understanding how these factors influence the HRF is essential for interpreting NIRS data and drawing accurate conclusions about early neural functioning and development. Therefore, the current study sets out to investigate the influence of birth weight and gestational age on brain hemodynamics in a variety of auditory and speech perception tasks, many of which have been shown to be robust and replicable <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">6</ref> , in 1-5day-old newborn infants.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">The Effects of Maturation and Learning</head><p>When investigating how the above-mentioned perinatal physiological factors influence newborns' brain responses, speech perception is a highly relevant cognitive ability that can be used as a model. The auditory system becomes functional around the 18-24th week of gestation, when the cochlea and the peripheral structures of the auditory system establish neural connections with the relevant subcortical and cortical areas <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">8</ref> . Thus, fetuses gradually start hearing sounds that are present in the womb. These include the mother's heartbeat, blood flow and breathing, digestive noises, the sounds generated by the mother's movements, the mother's speech and loud external sounds <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref> . These sounds are filtered by the maternal tissues and the amniotic fluid, so they have different acoustic characteristics inside the womb than outside. The mother's voice reaches the fetus in different ways, as it's transmitted through air when coming from the outside, while through the inside it's transmitted more directly through tissues and fluids, as well as in the form of vibrations, so it reaches the fetus more effectively than many other sounds <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">10</ref> . So, speech and language are some of the primary sounds a fetus encounters during the intrauterine period. This makes newborns' perception of speech sounds particularly relevant when testing the effects of experience and learning on the developing brain. As gestational age determines the duration of prenatal exposure, it is a useful proxy for assessing the impact of experience on the HRF and on NIRS measures of early linguistic abilities. As for birth weight, it is a commonly used indicator of overall prenatal health and maturation, and the single best predictor of later developmental outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref> . It is thus also important to understand how birth weight may impact HRF. These two important measures, gestational age (GA) and birth weight (BW) are easily available information when testing newborns, and can be the root of significant physiological variability even across full-term, typically developing infants: treating this group as if it was homogenous may underlie some of the hitherto unexplained variability in developmental studies.</p><p>In general, GA and BW are significant predictors of later development due to their impact on early neurodevelopment. Infants born preterm or with low birth weight are at increased risk for developmental impairments, including cognitive, motor, and language deficits 12 . Children born very preterm or with very low birth weight often perform lower in expressive and receptive language skills compared to their full-term peers, highlighting the importance of the last trimester for critical neurodevelopmental processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref> . This period is crucial for brain growth, and low birth weight is associated with reduced volumes of cortical gray and white matter essential for cognitive functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">16</ref> . The additional time for growth and development in utero supports better brain maturation, which is reflected in better cognitive performance and fewer developmental delays <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">18</ref> . The lung also begins its final maturational stage at about 36 weeks of gestation <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">19</ref> contributing to more mature neurovascular coupling, brain oxygenation and HRF in older fullterm newborns <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">20</ref> . Infants with longer gestational age and higher birth weight, even within the full-term norm (37-42 weeks), thus benefit from extended prenatal maturation and exposure to linguistic stimuli, enhancing overall brain development. These findings underscore the importance of a full-term, nurturing prenatal environment.</p><p>From a neurobiological perspective, while the adult brain's language system, primarily involving the superior temporal, inferior frontal, and parietal lobes in the left hemisphere, is wellcharacterized <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">22</ref> , its developmental trajectory in the infant brain is much less well understood.</p><p>Existing studies have established that the fetus can learn from the prenatally heard linguistic input, which already modifies newborns' auditory sensitivities and their neural correlates. fNIRS studies revealed that the brain's specialization for language begins before birth, shaped significantly by prenatal auditory experience. Newborns already exhibit stronger and/or more lateralized neural activity in the left temporal and frontal regions in response to native language stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref> than to unfamiliar ones, which elicit more bilateral and more reduced responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">24</ref> . This suggests that prenatal exposure drives the brain specialization for language, which then induces long-term changes in neural dynamics. EEG studies demonstrate that hearing their native language elevates newborns' neural activity during and after stimulation, with enhanced long-range temporal correlations in the theta band (4-8 Hz) <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">29</ref> . This effect is absent when infants are exposed to rhythmically unfamiliar languages, indicating that the rhythm and auditory structure of the native language shape neural dynamics <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">29</ref> .</p><p>In summary, language plays a crucial role in shaping newborns' cognitive and neurodevelopmental pathways and their brain activations. The early exposure to speech and language influences auditory cortex development, establishes memory traces, and facilitates neural tuning. Understanding how perinatal factors, such as GA and BW, affect these processes provides valuable insights into early brain organization and developmental trajectories.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3">Current study</head><p>The current study aims to investigate the effects of perinatal factors on newborns' NIRS responses to speech-like and other sound stimuli with a meta-analytic approach pooling together data from 14 published and unpublished newborn fNIRS studies. In these studies, infants are presented with two or more conditions of different auditory stimuli, testing newborns' abilities to discriminate between the different sounds.</p><p>In our study, we hypothesize a positive correlation between newborns' GA/BW and their hemodynamic responses. Specifically, we correlated two different NIRS measures with the perinatal variables: (i) the absolute magnitude of the NIRS response, i.e. the size of the NIRS response in a given experimental condition compared to baseline and (ii) the differential NIRS response, i.e. the difference between the responses to two conditions. We assume that the absolute magnitude of an infant's NIRS response is more closely related to the maturity of the infant's overall hemodynamic activity and neurovascular coupling, while the differential response between two conditions represents the infant's auditory discrimination ability and perceptual sensitivity and may thus be more specifically linguistic. Under this hypothesis, if gestational age and/or birth weight correlate with the overall magnitude of the NIRS response, it will be interpreted as a maturational effect, while if correlations are found between gestational age and/or birth weight and discrimination abilities, then more likely they are not driven by maturation alone, but also by the length of prenatal experience. We acknowledge, however, that maturation and prenatal experience are related to one another, and cannot completely be unconfounded in the studies included in our analysis, as they did not explicitly manipulate these factors. We simply use this approach as a suggestive interpretative framework.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.1">Studies</head><p>Data was assembled from 14 published and unpublished NIRS studies conducted in two different laboratories. The criteria for inclusion were (1) the examination of linguistic abilities of typically developing newborns (2) not older than 7 days (3) with the usage of NIRS brain imaging technique and (4) the availability of the infants' gestational age and birth weight. In the case of papers that included more than one study the individual experiments were considered as separate studies. This way, in the current research 14 studies were considered from the published papers of  <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">33</ref> , from the PhD dissertation of Bouchon, 2014 <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">34</ref> ; and from an unpublished paper by the members of the BabyLab of the University of Padua, Marino et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">35</ref> , which is currently under review. No other unpublished study that could be relevant is known. Overall, the included studies comprised data from 192 newborns, aged 1-4 days, tested in two different countries, Italy and France.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.3">Procedure</head><p>In all studies, newborns were tested using a NIRx NIRS device (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> Eight to ten sources and eight detectors were positioned on newborns' head bilaterally, with a source -detector distance of 2.5 to 3 cm, creating 10 to 12 channels on each hemisphere. Channel localization and numbering were consistent across the studies (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, Panel B). The exact anatomical localization of the resulting array is detailed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">30</ref> . As the left temporal and frontal regions are critical for auditory and speech processing already at birth <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[36]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[37]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[38]</ref> , the analyses focused on the left temporal lobe, defined as the cluster of channels 3 and 6, and the left inferior frontal lobe formed by channels 2 and 5 as well as the analogous right hemispheric regions (right temporal lobe: channels 17 and 19, right inferior frontal lobe: channels 13 and 15; Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, Panel B). We opted to use predetermined, anatomically defined ROIs, as the areas responsible for auditory and speech processing in newborns are well known, and because all studies used the same headgear configuration, resulting in comparable channel configurations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Data Analysis</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.1">NIRS preprocessing</head><p>NIRS data was pre-processed in the same way as in the original publications, which was similar across most studies. Briefly, light intensities were converted to optical densities, then to hemoglobin concentration changes using the modified Beer-Lambert Law with the absorption coefficients µa, mm-1 x mM-1: µa(HbO, 760 nm) = 0.1496, µa(HbO, 850 nm) = 0.2526, µa(HbR, 760 nm) = 0.3865 and µa(HbR, 850 nm) = 0.1798. The product of the optical pathlength and the differential pathlength factor was set to 1, resulting in concentration changes being expressed in mM x mm. A bandpass filter between 0.01 and 0.7 or 1 Hz -depending on the considered research paper -was applied to concentration changes using a fft digital filter. Then, as illustrated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">39</ref> , blocks of single-trial data were rejected if they contained motion artifacts or if the light intensity reached the saturation value, with motion artifacts defined as signal changes larger than 0.1 mM x mm over 0.2 sec. The artifact detection and trial rejection procedure were performed independently for each channel, and channels with less than at least two valid blocks were discarded from the analysis. Trial inclusion rate for each study ranged between 50 and 72% (across studies, mean: 60%, std: 8%). Finally, for the non-rejected blocks, a baseline was linearly fit between the mean of the 5 seconds preceding the onset of the block and the mean of the 5 seconds preceding the onset of the next one. Blocks were then averaged within each infant to obtain channel-wise blockaverages for each condition as well as across infants to obtain grand averages. This pre-processing routine has been shown to yield an accurate recovery of the infant hemodynamic response 6,39 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.2">Activation values and effect sizes</head><p>Individual trial data was employed to compute infant-level activation values, i.e. response magnitude, for the comparison of each condition against the zero baseline (Condition 1 vs. 0; Condition 2 vs. 0) as well as infant-level effect sizes, i.e. discrimination ability, for the betweencondition comparisons (Condition 1 vs. Condition 2). Activation values for each condition were computed as the average of each non-rejected trial response within a time window starting at the onset of stimulation and lasting up to 15 seconds after the stimulus' end, thus the window length differed between studies as they employed different window. Obtained activation values, for each trial, were then averaged for each newborn, channel and hemoglobin component if at least two valid, non-rejected trials for that baby/channel were available, otherwise that channel was rejected.</p><p>For each newborn, activation values were then further averaged within the four ROIs.</p><p>Infant-level effect sizes of between-condition differential responses, i.e. discrimination, were obtained by calculating the difference between the average activations in Conditions 2 and 1 and dividing the result by the standard deviation of trial-wise activation values from both conditions (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). Then, for each baby and hemoglobin component, channel-wise effect sizes were averaged within the four ROIs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.3">Extraction of individual gestational age and birth weight data</head><p>For each newborn, information about gender at birth, date of birth, date of test, gestational age and birth weight were collected. For the purposes of all subsequent analyses, birth weight was registered in grams, gestational age in days. Some of this information was missing for 90 newborns, who thus needed to be excluded from the overall sample of 282 newborns, resulting in a final dataset of 192 participants.</p><p>Gestational ages ranged from 255 to 298 days (M = 277.9, SD = 8.44), birth weight from 2235 to 4535 grams (M = 3308, SD = 387.25). As expected, there was a statistically significant correlation between the two (rho = 0.3968, p &lt; 0.001).</p></div>

The model yielded a significant main effect of ROI (F(1, 519) = 7.94, p &lt; 0.01), a significant BW X ROI interaction (F(1, 549) = 11.50, p &lt; 0.001), and a significant ROI X GA interaction (F(1, 523) = 12.22, p &lt; 0.001). The significant main effect of ROI was due to more positive effect sizes, i.e. less strong effects in the temporal than in the frontal areas, which however did not hold significance following post-hoc analyses. For the BW x ROI interaction, the post-hoc analysis revealed that the estimated slopes were found to be significantly more negative in the frontal than in the temporal ROIs with increasing birth weight (mean difference Frontal-Temporal= -0.000332, SE= 9.84e-05, t(552) = -3.37, p &lt; 0.001) (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">5a</ref>).</p><p>For GA X ROI, slopes were significantly more negative in the temporal than in the frontal ROIs with increasing gestational age (mean difference Frontal -Temporal= 0.0147, SE= 0.00423, t(526) = 3.48, p &lt; 0.001) (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">5b</ref>).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Effects of Birth Weight and Gestational Age on Brain Responses to Language</head><p>In the case of oxygenated hemoglobin activations to both Condition 1, i.e. the control, less complex auditory/linguistic condition, and Condition 2, i.e. the experimental condition, the analysis found no significant correlations with either BW or GA, but rather larger overall activations in the bilateral Temporal areas compared to the Frontal ones, a finding with ample convergence with the literature on newborns' early perceptual and linguistic abilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">40</ref> .</p><p>Interestingly, measures derived from HbR presented portray a more diversified account in terms of their relation with the considered perinatal factors. Condition 1 activations presented a different relation with Birth Weight in the temporal and frontal areas in the LH, which was less strongly observable in the RH. Specifically, HbR activations become more negative with increased BW significantly more in the temporal than in the frontal areas of the LH. This differential maturational pattern of the temporal and frontal regions is inverted between the two hemispheres, with activations getting stronger with increasing birth weight in the temporal as compared to the frontal area in the LH, and in the frontal as compared to the temporal area in the RH. These results were confirmed by showing significant negative correlations between activation and birth weight in the temporal left hemisphere and in the frontal right hemisphere. This hemispheric difference may be due to the LH's greater involvement in auditory and linguistic abilities, while the pattern found in the RH could reflect more generic maturational mechanisms.</p><p>This interpretation is further supported by results found on the effect sizes of the differential HbR responses between the two conditions, namely the discrimination task: in fact, they revealed statistically significant interactions between ROI and BW, and ROI and GA ,with increasing BW associated to stronger activations in the bilateral frontal areas, while increasing GA associated to stronger activations in the bilateral temporal areas. Following our interpretative proposal that that GA indicates the length of the prenatal experience, while BW represents the extent of biological maturation, these findings suggest that GA exhibits a stronger effect on a perceptual, auditory level affecting auditory discrimination mainly, hence it's significantly associated to stronger activations of the temporal areas where the auditory cortex is located. On the other hand, BW is suggested to reflect the maturation and development of more abstract, linguistic brain structures, i.e. Broca's area, located in the frontal region.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Implications</head><p>Most findings of the study highlight the effects of birth weight, but not gestational age. This may simply be a specificity of the dataset, as the two variables are correlated, and both reflect prenatal experience and maturation. However, it may also be that biological growth, indexed by birth weight is more important than the length of intrauterine experience. Gestational age may play a weaker role in the current context as the tested dataset included only full-term newborns. These infants reached at least 37 weeks of gestation, therefore they benefitted from prenatal exposure for the most part of the critical third trimester. The negligible effect of gestational age within the fullterm range suggests that by 37 weeks of gestation the foundational aspects of prenatal learning already occurred. In contrast, birth weight may still reflect significant individual differences, thus, within a full-term sample, birth weight may serve as a more sensitive indicator of early neurodevelopmental outcomes than gestational age. Indeed, birth weight is the most important predictor of later developmental outcomes for many cognitive abilities as well as pathologies <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">12</ref> .</p><p>Surprisingly, the results were stronger for deoxygenated hemoglobin compared to oxygenated hemoglobin. This is particularly relevant as many infant studies rely mostly on HbO. The reason for stronger effects in HbR may be that while HbO is more sensitive to the cognitive manipulations measured in typical experiments with newborns, HbR is more sensitive to overall biological maturation, growth and experience. Indeed, HbR correlates better with the BOLD response of MRI <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[41]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[42]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[43]</ref> . HbR is considered to exhibit a physiologically more robust response, therefore, it may also show a stronger correlation with prenatal experience and maturation than HbO. Based on these results, we suggest that HbR responses also be reported and investigated in fNIRS studies with newborns.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Limitations</head><p>In the current research, some limitations need to be acknowledged. The primary limitation arises from the diversity of the analyzed studies. Although, all of them used a consistent methodology and experimental design, due to the different targeted linguistic abilities the studies used different types of stimulation. This variability could affect the comparability of the results; however it may also contribute to the generalizability of the findings. The neural response to speech, on average, is robustly elicited across the dataset providing a solid foundation for investigating how individual level characteristics modulate such responses, but the diversity of stimuli and language abilities allowed us to examine systematic responses and see how early neural processes may operate across a range of linguistic stimuli.</p><p>A further limitation stems from the characteristics of the sample. The studies included only naturally conceived newborns. In natural, non-medically assisted pregnancies gestational age is an estimate, which may lack precision, potentially varying by 1-2 weeks. This imprecision could influence the estimate of the developmental stage of the newborns at the time of the study, thereby affecting the interpretation of its significance with respect to the linguistic abilities and maturation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Future Directions</head><p>This study highlights the different roles of birth weight and gestational age in shaping newborns' neural responses to language, suggesting several directions for future research. First, examining preterm and low birth weight newborns could further enhance the understanding of the effects of the length of prenatal experience and biological maturation. Besides, longitudinal studies could examine the developmental outcomes in regard of the examined physiological measures at birth. Finally, generalizability of these findings may be tested by expanding the research to more diverse linguistic and cultural contexts.</p><p>Importantly, given the stronger effects observed in HbR, the current study suggests reporting both HbO and HbR results in future newborn brain studies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusions</head><p>The increasing use of fNIRS in developmental research affords the opportunity to investigate brain responses in several perceptual domains from the earliest stages of life. Yet, a critical unanswered issue is whether and how the shape of the early HRF is modulated by perinatal factors such as birth weight (BW) and gestational age (GA). We found that the magnitude of NIRS de-oxygenated responses (HbR) was significantly associated with BW in the left temporal and right frontal areas. Moreover, when investigating newborns' discrimination abilities, we found that increasing BW was associated to activations getting stronger in the bilateral frontal areas; these findings together support the role of BW in reflecting the extent of biological maturation. Further, increasing GA was associated to activations becoming stronger in the bilateral temporal areas, suggesting that duration of prenatal experience significantly modulates auditory discrimination abilities. Relations with perinatal factors were only significant when using measures derived from the HbR component, indicating its higher sensitivity, compared to HbO, to overall biological maturation and growth.</p><p>Understanding how perinatal factors influence newborns' HRF may provide a better understanding of the unexplained variability in developmental studies, thus contributing to achieving a better interpretation of newborns' NIRS data and to drawing more accurate conclusions about early neural functioning and development.</p></div>

It showed that the interaction was driven by a difference between the slopes in the temporal and in the frontal areas in the LH (mean difference Frontal-Temporal= 1.33e-05, t(695) = 3.02, p &lt; 0.01): activations in the LH became more positive, i.e. less strong, with increasing BW in the frontal areas, but decreased, i.e. became stronger, in the temporal areas. The opposite was found in the RH, with a positive slope for the temporal (slope= 1.13e-06) and a negative one for the frontal regions (slope = -3.99e-06), although the direct post-hoc comparison within the RH did not yield a statistically significant difference. Conversely, the post-hoc analysis revealed a positive LH-RH difference between slopes in the Frontal areas (mean difference= 1.06e-05, SE= 4.64e-06, t(660)= 2.27, p &lt; 0.05), and a negative LH-RH difference between slopes in the Temporal area (mean difference = -7.80e-06, SE= 3.97e-06, t(654)= -1.96, p &lt; 0.05): the Temporal and Frontal areas display an opposite lateralization pattern of the slopes between activations and birth weight, with activations becoming stronger with increasing BW in the left temporal and right frontal areas, and becoming weaker with increasing BW in the right temporal and left frontal areas. These results were confirmed by correlations, which demonstrated a significant negative correlation between activations and birth weight in the left temporal area (rho = -0.1265, p &lt; 0.05) and in the right frontal area (rho = -0.1468, p &lt; 0.05).</figDesc></figure>
