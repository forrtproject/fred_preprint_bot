<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"> Markowitz (1952)  <p>asset risk (MAR) has long been challenged. First, asset volatility captures the noise of asset risk over maturity that improperly reflects asset risk (which has to be measured over a unit of time length to be cumulative since asset holder's risk approaches zero as the holding time length approaches zero). Second, we argue that asset risk approaches zero as payment distance approaches zero, and that asset risk drives volatility, but not vice versa, implying that asset risk cannot be diversified away.</p><p>Third, support to MAR appears to arise from a confusion between asset value and wealth utility-the law of diminishing marginal utility supports that volatility reduces the latter. The above causes explain why CAPM and Fama-French models have long been struggling to price asset volatilities. To address the challenges, we propose that the gross volatility (variance), which includes the excess risk ALPHA, of realized (expected) asset value approaches zero as distance approaches zero. We delineate expected asset value (which asset risk impacts without a distribution) and risk volatility (which does not affect the former while following a blended normal distribution we proposed). Our asset risk for a specific asset excludes the macrorisk in Nie (2024a) that is tied to assets with a face value denominated by the currency. We show that equity price is the present value of a spanning bond, a payment spanning over the predictable lifetime of firm performance, and that options are equity bonds. Our examples show how to compute a firm's debt and equity risk. Our asset risk, captured as risk premium, thus solves issues that have long been challenging agency theories, thereby redefining firm misvaluation theory.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Holding a stock over a minute or a year, your risk remains the same.</p><p>This is what schools around the world have been effectively teaching over 70 years, as <ref type="bibr">Jenson and Meckling (1976)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Markowitz (1952)</ref> asset risk (henceforth, MAR), in effect, claim that asset holder's risk remains the same regardless of the holding time length. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> A comparable case is the value of a condominium building that is irrelevant to the value of the units you buy: the former remains the same, regardless of the number of the units you buy. In contrast to the risk of one-time activities, such as lottery drawings, the risk of activities continuing over a period of time, such as asset holding, is cumulative like a salary. For instance, the risk of two-day fighting on the Ukrainian battlefield is about twice that of one-day fighting. As illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>, asset holder's longitudinal risk (LR) approaches zero as the holding time length T approaches zero. Our LR usually ignores the asset value thereby assuming one unit of the currency.</p><p>[Please insert Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> about here]</p><p>One could argue that a relevant asset risk does not have to be a risk over a unit of time length (which is a year in this study). For example, a Tesla's driving risk can be meaningfully tagged as Tier 1, Tier 2, or Tier 3, which does not mean that your risk remains the same regardless how many hours you drive. This argument, however, ignores the fact that asset pricing models use returns over a unit of time length to price volatility that reflects the noise of asse risk over maturity (which we will show in Section 2). To be relevant, we have to measure the risk and the return both over a unit of time length or both over maturity.<ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">2</ref> MAR thus prevents scholars from measuring asset holder's risk over a period, such as managerial risk that captures managerial skin in the game (which plays a key role in agency and contracting theories). A manager's risk over the contracting period motivates, thereby reflecting, her effort over the holding period. This is why a firm usually requires managers to hold firm assets over certain periods. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">3</ref>Yet another challenge to MAR is that volatility of a distribution does not decrease asset value although the former is positively associated with asset risk. In this study, asset volatility excludes the excess risk ALPHA (i.e., A) that leads to the excess return alpha (i.e., ÔÅ°) when we suggest that the volatility follows a blended normal distribution we proposed (see Section 2.5). A more serious issue is that assets more uncorrelated to the current portfolio are likely to incur higher cognition cost-the current portfolio holder is likely to be less informed of the assets' risk. This explains why asset pricing models have long been struggling to relate volatility to asset returns (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Fama and</ref><ref type="bibr">French, 2015, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Lintner, 1965;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Sharpe, 1964)</ref>. Longman Dictionary defines risk as "the possibility that something bad, unpleasant, or dangerous may happen". For investors, indeed, volatility may not be bad or dangerous if it is not associated with a permanent loss of asset value. We believe that volatility is positively associated with asset risk. However, we argue that asset risk causes volatility, but not vice versa. For example, the number of birds hanging out on a city is highly correlated to the amount of bird droppings on the ground. However, the former drives the latter, but not vice versa. Similarly, hold maturity constant, asset risk is related to volatility proportionately. The latter, however, does not affect the former, which cannot be diversified away.</p><p>The argument that a diversification strategy reduces asset risk, therefore, is as unjustifiable as the argument that cleaning workers' effort to decrease the quantity of bird droppings on the ground reduces the number of birds hanging out on the city.</p><p>Finally, support to MAR appears to come from a confusion between asset value and wealth utility, because the law of diminishing marginal utility (LDMU) suggests that wealth volatility reduces the latter, rather than the former. To illustrate, we suppose that an investor has wealth w0 that includes a risk-free asset and a risky asset whose price follows a normal distribution. Given two opposite impacts that change the price of risky asset P by x and ÔÄ≠x, respectively, ÔÄ¢ x ÔÉé (0, P), we examine the two impacts' net effect on the wealth utility that reflects the effect of volatility of a normal distribution on the expected asset value. As illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>, given the investor's wealth utility function U, LDMU indicates that the first order differential is positive (i.e., U' &gt; 0) and that the second order differential is negative (i.e., U'' &lt; 0). Obviously, the net change in wealth utility from the two opposite impacts on the risky asset, which is negative, captures the net impact: ÔÅÑU = ‚à´ ùëàÔÇ¢(ùë§) ùëëùë§ ÔÄ≠ ‚à´ ùëàÔÇ¢(ùë§) ùëëùë§ &lt; 0.</p><p>(1)</p><p>Therefore, LDMU supports that the utility loss from a decrease in the risky asset's value by x (i.e., the height of brown pole) is always greater than the utility gain from an increase in asset value by x (i.e., the height of green pole). In short, asset volatility reduces wealth utility rather than asset value. Further, we observe that the loss is greater for poor people-the loss is greater when we reduce the risk-free asset's value such that the wealth decreases from w0 to w1. In fact, our conclusion remains intact if we reduce the values of the risky and risk-free assets by the same fraction such that the overall wealth decreases from w0 to w1. To sum up, the more volatile the wealth, the greater the utility loss; the lower the wealth, the greater the impact.</p><p>[Please insert Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> about here]</p><p>In case of a lognormal distribution, the net change in wealth utility from the two opposite impacts of a lognormal distribution can be written as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">ÔÅÑU = ‚à´ ùëàÔÇ¢(ùë§) ùëëùë§ ÔÄ≠ ‚à´ ùëàÔÇ¢(ùë§) ùëëùë§ . (<label>2</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_1">)</formula><p>Diversification in effect is a strategy that reduces the magnitudes of temporary losses at a cost of reduced sizes of temporary gains. Even in terms of wealth utility, the benefit of a diversification strategy is likely to be insignificant economically, because volatility is more harmful to the wealth utility of poor people (who can hardly hold risky assets greatly when diversification is a simple choice of their own) than to that of rich people. In addition, we argue that that assets more uncorrelated to the current portfolio incur higher cognition cost. Therefore, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Black and Scholes (1973)</ref> effectively treat options as risk-free, because asset volatility effectively raises option value as we will show in Section 2.</p><p>To address the above challenges, we expunge maturity from volatility to measure asset risk over a unit of time length. As in <ref type="bibr">Nie (2024)</ref>, we convert the central bank's rate into a continuously compounding rate for estimation purpose. This is because the rates in our models are continuously compounding whereas those from the central bank and the market are annual rates. As in Nie (2024a), the risk-free rate is equal to the central bank's rate plus the constant risk which captures the depreciation cost of interbank lending. All rates in this study related to equity and corporate debt, however, are all continuously compounding.</p><p>We assume that the noise of asset risk follows a blended normal distribution we proposed.</p><p>Since volatility of a distribution is not a risk to asset value, our asset risk impacts asset value without a distribution, reflecting the magnitude and/or possibility of a decrease in the expected asset value. In particular, we separate the expected asset value (which the risk affects without a distribution) from the volatility (which does not impact the former while following a blended lognormal distribution). Our analyses highly depend on the strong logic of an exclusive disjunction:</p><p>one must be right if the other is wrong. All assets with a face value carry the inflation risk or the investment opportunity cost that mirrors the country's T-bill risk in <ref type="bibr">Nie (2024a)</ref>. To be comparable across assets, a corporate bond's risk (i.e., micro-risk or default risk) is defined as a one-year payment's risk. We show that equity price is actually the present value of a spanning bond-a payment spanning over the predictable lifetime of firm performance (i.e., firm maturity). A spanning bond's risk thus is also defined as a one-year payment's risk that approaches zero as maturity approaches zero. We show that options are equity bonds paid with equity, in contrast to T-bills and corporate bonds that are cash bonds paid with cash. Our asset risk is a one-year payment's risk, whereas our longitudinal risk is the risk accumulated over asset maturity or the holding time length. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_3">4</ref> We show that the gross volatility (variance), which includes the excess risk ALPHA, of realized (expected) asset value approaches zero as the measuring distance approaches zero. We reject the notion that uncertainty is a risk since unexpected increase in asset value is not a risk.</p><p>Asset pricing models, such as CAPM and Fama-French ones, have long been struggling to explain their asset risk. This study proposes a new measure of asset risk to address these challenges.</p><p>Applying our risk measure to a principal-agent relationship, we illustrate that the agent's risk over the contracting period represents the agent's skin in the game that motivates, thereby capturing, the agent's effort. The agent's effort thus is observable to both parties, opposite to the literature claims (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Holmstrom, 1979;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Harris and Raviv, 1976;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Mirrlees, 1974</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Mirrlees, , 1976))</ref>.</p><p>Our methodology has to be developed into software to be widely usable, which is almost impossible decades ago when computers and internet are largely inaccessible. We contribute to several strands of literatures. First, we contribute to the asset pricing literature with a new measure of asset risk (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Markowitz, 1952;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Lintner, 1965;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Jensen and Meckling, 1979;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Black, 1972;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Black and Scholes, 1973;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Sharpe, 1964;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Fama and</ref><ref type="bibr">French, 1997, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Fama, 1968;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Samuelson, 1965;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Samuelson and Merton, 1969)</ref>. Our asset risk, captured as risk premium, negatively impacts expected asset value without a distribution. Removing maturity from asset volatility, we produce a risk that investors truly care about. We argue that uncertainty is not a risk, suggesting that the literature improperly measures option risk. We propose that asset risk causes volatility, but not vice versa, arguing that asset risk cannot be diversified away.</p><p>Second, our asset risk allows us to compute managerial risk of inside debt holdings, option grants, and stockholdings, thereby solving issues that have long been challenging agency and contracting theories. (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Harris and Raviv, 1976;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Stiglitz, 1975;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Spence and Zeckhauser, 1971;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Murphy, 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Ross, 1973;</ref><ref type="bibr">Jensen and</ref><ref type="bibr">Meckling, 1976, 1979;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Holmstrom, 1979;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Lambert and Larcker, 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Baker and Wurgler, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Loughran and Ritter, 1995)</ref>. MAR prevents scholars from calculating the longitudinal risk. Our asset risk, in contrast, allows us to obtain a manager's risk that captures her effort over the period.</p><p>Third, our asset risk is defined as a one-year payment's risk, which approaches zero as maturity approaches zero. We propose that the gross volatility (variance) of realized (expected) asset value approaches zero as measuring distance approaches zero. We show that equity value reflects a spanning bond's present value, which is a payment spanning over firm maturity, transforming equity price volatility in a year into the spanning bond's baseline risk.</p><p>Fourth, our equity price movement delineates the spanning bond's excess risk ALPHA (i.e., A), which causes the excess return alpha (i.e., ÔÅ°), and volatility that follows a blended normal distribution (which includes the put and the call distribution). We suggest that an option is an equity bond paid with equity, and that the difference between the option's price and present value captures the overcharge or the transaction cost.</p><p>Finally, our asset risk is directly related to asset value, thereby redefining firm misvaluation theories (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Dong, Hirshleifer, and Teoh, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Loughran and Ritter, 1995)</ref>. We assume that managers have information advantage about the risk of their firm and future changes in the risk.</p><p>The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 deducts a new measure of asset risk that is captured as risk premium, measuring the gross volatility (variance) of realized (expected) asset value. Section 3 simply shows how our measure of asset risk solves problems that have long been challenging agency and firm misvaluation theories. Section 4 concludes.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Asset risk definition</head><p>To capture asset risk properly, we start from people's response to the increased risk for a product or task-higher premium. This also explains why scholars and practitioners take bond spread as compensation for the increased risk. Therefore, risk premium, which is cumulative over the holding time length, is our ideal proxy for asset risk. A premium-proxied asset risk thus reflects the possibility/magnitude of a permanent loss in the expected value which does not follow a distribution. We argue that asset risk causes the volatility (variance) of realized (expected) asset value, but not vice versa, suggesting that asset risk cannot be diversified away. We support that the volatility (i.e., the noise) of asset risk is positively associated with asset risk, following a blended normal distribution (which we will discuss in Section 2.5). We thus delineate the realized asset value (which asset risk affects without a distribution) and volatility (which does not impact the former while following a distribution). <ref type="foot" target="#foot_4">5</ref> We expect that asset return (volatility) reflects the market's (ir)rational perception of asset risk over maturity: the more lasting (temporary) of a price movement, the more likely to be treated as a return (volatility). Asset volatility thus reflects the predictable uncertainty whereas asset risk, which is positively associated with the former, captures the unpredictable possibility and/or magnitude of a lasting loss in asset value. Consistent with the debt risk in Nie (2024a), our asset risk is defined as:</p><p>Proposition 1 Asset risk is a payment's risk that approaches zero as maturity approaches zero.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">The risk and the risk-free rate</head><p>As in <ref type="bibr">Nie (2024a)</ref>, the continuously compounding return of a constant rate r is given by:<ref type="foot" target="#foot_5">6</ref> ùëå (ùëü) = ‚à´ ùëí ( ) -1 ùëëùë° = ‚à´ (ùëí -1)ùëëùë° = ùëá(ùëí -1) .</p><p>(3)</p><p>In contrast, conventional concept gives the return of a constant rate r over T as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">ùëå (ùëü) = ‚à´ ùëüùëí ùëëùë° = ùëí -1 . (<label>4</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_3">)</formula><p>Nie (2024a) splits US and Canada T-bill yield into the inflation risk (i.e., macrorisk) rÔÇ¢f(t) and the risk-free rate rf(t). The paper argues that the risk-free rate largely reflects the expected inflation rate, and that the inflation risk mirrors the unexpected inflation effect or the investment opportunity cost for assets with a face value at maturity. The risk-free rate reflects the central bank's shortterm rate plus a risk constant over maturity that captures the depreciation cost of the interbank lending rate. Thus, the nondepreciating asset value over T is equal to the asset value with the riskfree return over T. An independence model, however, supports that the risk-free return of a nondepreciating value, does not produce a risk return, and vice versa, as implied by the dependence models. In Nie(2024a), the market expects the current monetary policy to move the current rate ùëü towards the neutral rate ùëü over the period Tm. To be comparable across assets, the inflation risk ùëüÔÇ¢ is measured as a 1-year payment's risk. Then, the inflation risk at time t can be written as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">ùëüÔÇ¢ (ùë°) = ùëüÔÇ¢ (ùëáÔÄ≠ ùë°), t ÔÉé (0, T).<label>(5)</label></formula><p>On top of the macrorisk, a bond's microrisk (i.e., default risk or firm risk) can be expressed as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">ùëü (ùë°) = ùëü (ùëáÔÄ≠ ùë°), t ÔÉé (0, T).<label>(6)</label></formula><p>The central bank's rate (i.e., the risk-free rate) at time t can be written as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">ùëüùëì(ùë°) = ùëü ÔÄ´ ÔÄ≠ ùëü , (ùë° &gt; ùëá ) .

As Nie (2024a), we allow the risk-free return ùëå ùëü generated within ùëá to generate return beyond ùëá :</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">ùëå ùëü = ùëå ùëü + ùëå ùëü + ùëå ùëü √ó ùëå ùëü = ùëå ùëü + 1 ùëå ùëü + 1 -1 = ÔÄ≠ -ùëá + 1 (ùëá -ùëá )(ùëí -1) + 1 -1.<label>(10)</label></formula><p>As in <ref type="bibr">Nie (2024a)</ref>, ùëå ùëü is the predicted asset return in this study, where the subscript T is maturity or the time length over which the return is measured, and ùëü , the variable in the bracket, is the highest level of return-factor including the applicable lower levels. A return can have as many as 3 levels (from the lowest to the highest): 1. The risk-free rate ùëü (plus the constant risk ùëü ); 2. The inflation risk for assets with a face value at maturity: ùëüÔÇ¢ ; 3. The corporate debt risk:</p><p>ùëü , or the spanning bond's risk: ùëü , or the risk for holding a spanning bond over time: ùëü . We use ùëÖ ùëüÔÇ¢ to reflect the longitudinal risk over maturity T, where the variable in the bracket is the risk computed. The 4-factor independence model in <ref type="bibr">Nie (2024a)</ref> gives the longitudinal risk of ùëüÔÇ¢ over T as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">ùëÖ ùëüÔÇ¢ = ùëí ÔÇ¢ ( ÔÄ≠ ) -1 ùëëùë° = ÔÇ¢ ÔÇ¢ -ùëá.<label>(11)</label></formula><p>Given a T-bill's risk ùëüÔÇ¢ and maturity T, the return can be expressed as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">ùëå ùëüÔÇ¢ = ùëå ùëü + ùëÖ ùëüÔÇ¢ .

(<label>13</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_15">)</formula><p>The 4-factor independence model in Nie (2024a) reveals strong power in explaining T-bill returns, on average predicting 99.1% of US T-bill returns (including those reported in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>), and 99.3%</p><p>excluding the partially continuously compounding (PCC) regime, that is, ùëå ùëü √ó ùëå ùëü in formula (10). The paper concludes that conventional continuously compounding rates and annual rates entangle the risk with the risk-free rate. This study uses the 4-factor independence model to compute the T-bill metrics including PCC. The inflation risk ùëüÔÇ¢ is tied to assets with a face value denominated by the depreciating currency. 7 This unexpected inflation effect is not a risk for assets without a face value because unexpected inflation only increases their market value. Given the asset price and the T-bill metrics, we can solve the microrisk with repeated trials. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">3</ref> illustrates how a bond's return is generated over maturity. The expected value at time t, that is, ùê∑ for debt or ùê∏ for equity, is equal to the current price plus the return, which reflects the asset holding cost, over t. The marginal asset holding cost of the bond declines over time because a 7 We expect that a 10-year inflation risk approximately reflects the long-term inflation effect. For instance, our limited T-bill metrics data from the 4-factor independence model in <ref type="bibr">Nie (2024a)</ref> indicate that the mean Canada (US) 10-year inflation risk is about 1.9% (3.7%) from Jan 2024 to July 2024 when the mean inflation rate reported by the government over the period is 1.9% (3.6%), which is available at https://tradingeconomics.com.</p><p>payment's risk approaches zero as maturity approaches zero regardless if the risk-free rate is constant over time. Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref> illustrates how a market noise of firm risk moves a corporate bond's price, or alternatively, how a bond's volatility reflects the noise of asse risk over maturity. A noise raises debt risk by ÔÅÑrd, thereby reducing the price by ÔÅÑD that mirrors the increased longitudinal risk over T: ùëÖ (ùëü + ÔÅÑùëü ) -ùëÖ (ùëü ). Thus formula (11) allows us to obtain ÔÅÑùëü given ÔÅÑD. We will propose in Section 2.8 that the gross volatility (variance) of realized (expected) asset value approaches zero as distance approaches zero.</p><p>[Please insert Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">3</ref> and<ref type="figure">4</ref> about here]</p></div>

Observing that the estimated risk numbers appear to be very high or very low over some specific days, we rework on the T-bill metrics either by trying to reduce the MAV (i.e., the mean absolute value of T-bill prediction errors) or by generating more recent T-bill metrics. For instance, we extract T-bill data on 29 May 2024 to obtain more recent T-bill measures, finding that the bond's gross risk noise, that is, ÔÅÑùëü , = ùëü , -ùëü , on day i for each of the 252 trading days, for June 2024 appears to be abnormally low.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">A spanning bond</head><p>First, we show that equity price reflects the present value of a payment spanning over equity maturity (i.e., a spanning bond) that mirrors the predictable lifetime of the firm's performance. An example to explain firm maturity, beyond which a payment has no present value. Suppose that a firm's debt risk rd plus the inflation risk rÔÇ¢f is equal to 1%, and that the firm's long-term nondepreciating profitability is 10%. Then our debt risk theory supports that: 1) the risk is almost zero for a payment in a day; 2) the risk reaches 1%, 5%, and 10% by the end of the 1st, 5th, and 10th year, respectively; 3) the nondepreciating yield of a 10-year bond is 5% while the marginal debt cost reaches 10% at the end of the 10th year. Thus, firm maturity in terms of the firm's debt is 10 years where the nondepreciating performance (i.e., payment) accounting for the risk decreases to zero-a point beyond which a payment has no present value because such a payment is unsustainable and expected to default. We define a firm's bond reaching this point as firm maturity bond (FMB). Firm maturity captures the predictable lifetime of firm performance, reflecting the maximum risk acceptable to the market. In short, equity price represents the present value of the firm's spanning bond. To help understand, we can treat equity value as the present value of a series of "daily nondepreciating payments" spanning over equity maturity Te, where a daily payment reflects the nondepreciating value that we expect the firm to produce on a daily basis. Therefore, equity value reflects the present value that the market expects the firm to continuously pay over Te, whereas the price of a corporate bond is the present value of the onetime payment at maturity T. Therefore, volatility improperly reflects asset risk because volatility is positively associated with maturity.</p><p>The present value of the continuous payment is highly correlated to, but different from, the firm's earnings and profits. For example, Apple's performance is below the market expectation if the nondepreciating price remains the same in a month since the latter price has less present value after accounting for the asset holding risk. Today is 24 Oct 2024, the risk re mirrors the risk of a nondepreciating payment on 24 Oct 2025. Thus, the risk at t can be written as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_25">re(t) = ùëü ùë°, t ÔÉé (0, Te).<label>(21)</label></formula><p>As illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">5</ref>, the continuous payment's risk moves from current zero to maximum at Te, while that of the one-time payment moves from current maximum to zero at T.</p><p>For a spanning bond's return, the unexpected inflation effect acts like a risk-free return rather than a risk in raising the market value denominated by the depreciating currency. Therefore, the return of a spanning bond is similar to that of a corporate bond ignoring the inflation risk:</p><formula xml:id="formula_26">ùëå (ùëü ) = ùëå ùëü + (ùëí -1) ùëëùë° = ùëå ùëü + -ùëá = ùëå ùëü + ùëÖ (ùëü ). (<label>22</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_27">)</formula><p>where ùëå ùëü is given by formula (10).</p><p>To analyze a spanning bond's value and risk, we cannot confuse the expected growth in equity value over time with the value that we expect the spanning bond to generate over maturity. The former is like the railway on which the train of spanning bond moves with the wheels ùê∏ and ùëü on the track. The return independence assumption allows us to ignore the effect of the payment's risk-free return ùëü (ùë°) that reflects the inflation effect on the asset's market value. Ignoring the riskfree return, the spanning bond's marginal present value (which we expect the firm to generate over maturity ùëá ) is nondepreciating. Remember, the marginal present value generated by the firm declines to zero at ùëá after accounting for the payment risk ùëü ùë°, which increases from current zero to maximum of ùëü ùëá at maturity ùëá (see, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">6</ref>). Then, the spanning bond's present value is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_28">ùê∏ = ùê∏ ‚à´ (ùëí -ùëí )ùëëùë°.<label>(23)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_29">ÔÉû 1 = ùëá ùëí + . (<label>24</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_30">)</formula><p>Formula (24) allows us to easily obtain ùëá with repeated trials given ùëü , as ùëá monotonically increases with lower ùëü . As demonstrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">6</ref>, equity price ùê∏ reflects the firm's lifetime performance in excess of the asset holding cost, and that the marginal present value produced by the firm declines to zero at ùëá when the spanning bond's marginal holding cost overtakes the marginal performance. Thus, ùê∏ mirrors the present value of the firm's lifetime performance.</p><p>[Please insert Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">5</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">6</ref> about here]</p><p>The risk for holding the spanning bond over time can be computed as a value-weighted risk:</p><formula xml:id="formula_31">= ‚à´ ùëí ùëü ùë°ùëëùë° -‚à´ ùëí ùëü ùë°ùëëùë° = 0.5ùëü ùëá ùëí - ‚à´ = 0.5ùëü ùëá ùëí + = 0.5ùëü ùëá ùëí -1.

(<label>26</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_34">)</formula><p>Without developing software to delineate the risk and the risk-free rate of T-bills on a daily basis, we cannot examine the risk noise that accounts for the noise of inflation risk and the riskfree rate (which affects the depreciating value of various assets). Therefore, we assume that the macrorisk's noise influences asset value through only through the firm's microrisk, and that management actions, such as restructures of firm debt or capital, affect asset risk as a permanent change only in the long-term. In the short-term, therefore, our price error on day i is caused by the gross risk noise ÔÅÑùëü , (which includes the excess risk ALPHA A and the risk noise ÔÅÑùëü , ), rather than the change in the expected asset value such as a change in the long-term growth rate or a loss of value from the firm's accident or legal issue (which affect asset price through another channel).</p><p>We expect that the equity holding risk ùëü remains unchanged when the gross noise ÔÅÑùëü , changes equity maturity ùëá by ÔÅÑùëá , and equity price ùê∏ by ÔÅÑùê∏ , as in Figure <ref type="figure">7</ref>.

To this end, we use formula (29) to transform the gross volatility of equity price over in the year into the premium-based risk ùëü , expecting that equity price movement reveals the gross volatility that is positively related to ùëü . Observing that the ratio well captures a 10-year payment's risk of a spanning bond, we simply obtain the baseline risk as the ratio of the standard deviation of equity price to the mean price in a year. In particular, we compute the risk as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_38">ùëü = . (<label>30</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_39">)</formula><p>where ùëâ is the standard deviation of price in the year, and ùëÉ is the mean price in the year.</p><p>Although the gross volatility yields the baseline risk, a diversification strategy cannot reduce a portfolio's risk, because a less correlated diversifying firm is likely to raise the cognition cost(risk).</p><p>Intuitively, the risk of a payment without a face value is riskier than that with a face value, because equity holders are actually responsible for the firm's debt payment. Figure <ref type="figure">7</ref> suggests that the value curve of a spanning bond revolves counter clockwise when the risk increases. As illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure">8</ref>, the more (less) informed market can raise (reduce) the longitudinal risk ùëÖ (ùëü ) over time whereas the decrease (increase) in the expected asset value at maturity is not according to formula (27). To be more specific, the market can reduce (raise) the risk and/or the growth rate, which reduces (raises) the expected bond value at ùëá thereby rotating the curve (counter-)clockwise. Curve ùê∏ , represents the present value discounting the risk-free return, whereas curve ùê∏ additionally discounts the longitudinal risk ùëÖ (ùëü ), that is, ùëü over ùëá . Curve ùê∏ , is the equity value when the market treats the negative event wholly as an increase in the spanning bond's risk by ÔÅÑùëõ. The decrease in equity price is given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_40">ÔÅÑùëÅ = ( ) ÔÄ≠ , ( ÔÅÑ ) . (<label>31</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_41">)</formula><p>where ùëå (ùëü ) and ùëå , (ùëü + ÔÅÑùëõ) are spanning bond's returns given by formula ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_26">22</ref>).</p><p>As indicated by curve ùê∏ , , the market treats the event wholly as a decrease in the firm's current wealth by ÔÅÑùëÅ thereby reducing the expected value at ùëá by ÔÅÑùëÅ(1 + ùëå ùëü ), where ùëå ùëü reflects the inflation effect over ùëá . Thus, the curve can turn between the two lines given ÔÅÑre ÔÉé (0, ÔÅÑn) even if the price remains unchanged. The transformation of a risk (noise) in the real market can be more complicated than the above example. Thus, we use (30), rather than ùëü plus the gross risk noise (i.e., ÔÅÑùëü ) at the end of the year, to obtain the baseline risk of the next calendar year.</p><p>[Please insert Figures <ref type="figure">7</ref> and<ref type="figure">8</ref> about here]</p><p>Given ùëü of a spanning bond, and equity price change ÔÅÑùê∏ on day i, we can easily obtain the gross risk noise ÔÅÑùëü , with repeated trials, as we can move the trial value of ÔÅÑùëü , indefinitely close to the true value of ÔÅÑùëü , that increases monotonically with lower ÔÅÑùê∏ .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5">A blended normal distribution</head><p>An example to explain a blended normal distribution. Suppose the ACT scores of US high school students perfectly follow a normal distribution with a median (mean) of 21. Then high schools change the scoring policy by awarding each point above 21 with two more points. We propose that the new scores follow a blended normal distribution-the standard deviation of scores above the median is different from that of scores below the median. This study assumes that the noise of asset risk follows a blended normal distribution-the asset price thus follows a blended lognormal distribution. The blended ratio (BR) with 2ùëõ or 2ùëõ + 1 observations can be written as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_42">BR= ( ) ( ) .

For a spanning bond, we compute alpha as the change in the holding risk driven by ALPHA as suggested by formula (25):</p><formula xml:id="formula_44">ÔÅ° = 0.5(ùëü + ùê¥)(ùëá + ÔÅÑùëá ) ùëí ( )( ÔÅÑ ) -0.5ùëü ùëá ùëí .

We thus expect that the risk noise, which accounts for ALPHA, has zero median. In case of even observations, such as 252 trading days which is usually considered to be a calendar year, our ALPHA value requires that BR is equal to the minus ratio of the smallest positive score to the smallest negative score.</p><p>Asset volatility at a time reflects the noise of asset risk over maturity.

Then options are actually equity bonds paid.

One may confuse the risk of holding the underlying share with that of holding the option. The former is expected to be ùëü over time, whereas the latter decreases to zero at maturity T when the option holder obtains either zero equity value or certain equity value that she can sell immediately. In case she holds the equity obtained from the option exercise, she makes another investment. Therefore, the spanning bond's risk ùëü , which is a one-year payment's risk, reflects the option's risk. However, the former increases from current zero to maximum at ùëá while the latter decreases from current maximum to zero at T. Therefore, the risk of an option with 100% exercise possibility, where the option holder holds the full distribution, can be expressed as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_50">ùëü (ùë°) = ùëü (ùëáÔÄ≠ ùë°), t ÔÉé (0, T).

Then, we can compute the bottom line, or benchmark excess risk ùê¥ of the investor, such that the asset's present value is not below the option price.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Corporate financing and market misperception of firm risk</head><p>The risk determines the value, but not vice versa: one goes up, the other goes down. This is what MAR fundamentally obscures and asset pricing models have long been struggling to prove.</p><p>For instance, market timing hypothesis suggests that managers conduct a seasoned equity offering (SEO) when their firm is overvalued, or a share repurchase when their firm is undervalued (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Baker and Wurgler, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Loughran and Ritter, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Dong, Hirshleifer, and Teoh, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Khan, Kogan, and Serafeim, 2012)</ref>. In contrast, we argue that market misperception of firm risk, rather than firm value, drives firm financing decisions. The literature also ignores the fact that the market may correct debt risk as well when it corrects equity risk, thereby missing the cost of the equivalent debt repurchase (issuance) associated with the SEO (share repurchase). Managers not only affect the risk of the firm that they manage, they are also better informed of the risk and its future changes.</p><p>A firm thus always profits from an equity issuance (repurchase) when firm risk observed by the market is lower (higher) than the true risk. Since a firm's equity risk is always much higher than its debt risk, the value gained from a market correction of firm risk is always greater than the value lost from the equivalent debt repurchase (issuance). For instance, the Apple corporate bond has a mean risk of 15.44 bps in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>, 14 in contrast to a proximate mean risk of 4.77% for equity holding in the examining year in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">9</ref>. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_8">15</ref> Therefore, the cost caused by the change in the former is negligible compared to that caused by the change the spanning bond's risk.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusion</head><p>We argue that asset risk has to be cumulative because the longitudinal risk approaches zero as the holding time length approaches zero. We show that asset volatility reflects the noise of asset risk over maturity, which improperly reflects the risk of market participants although we do not care about the holding time length that are up to themselves. A manager's risk, however, captures her skin in the game that motivates, thereby reflecting, her effort in the principal-agent relationship.</p><p>MAR thus prevents scholars from measuring managerial risk. We argue that asset risk causes 14 As reported in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>, the microrisk prior to the examining year is 14.30 bps while the mean risk noise in the year is 1.14. Thus, the mean risk over the year is equal to 14.30 ÔÄ´ 1.14 = 15.44 bps.</p><p>volatility, but not vice versa, supporting that asset risk cannot be diversified away as diversification can incur additonal cognition cost. Finally, support to MAR appears to emerge from a confusion between asset value and wealth utility: LDMU suggests that asset volatility reduces the latter. In fact, diversification decreases the magnitudes of temporary losses at a cost of reduced sizes of temporary gains. Speculative investors, especially option investors, actually depend on volatility to profit. Even in terms of wealth utility, we expect that the benefit of a diversification solution is economically insignificant, because poor people, whom LDMU affects significantly, can hardly afford to hold risky assets largely when diversification is a simple choice of their own. These causes explain why CAPM and Fama-French models have largely failed to price asset volatility that reflects the noise of asset risk over maturity. To address these challenges, we separate expected asset value (i.e., which asset risk impacts without a distribution) from volatility (which does not affect the former while following a blended lognormal distribution we proposed).</p><p>Our asset risk for a specific asset ignores the macrorisk of <ref type="bibr">Nie (2024a)</ref> that is tied to assets with a face value denominated by the depreciating currency. Our nondepreciating asset value accounts for the expected risk-free rate, which is captured as the expected inter-bank short-term rate plus the constant risk (i.e., the depreciation cost of the short-term rate). Our equity risk is a payment's risk that approaches zero as maturity approaches zero, reflecting a one-year payment's risk to be comparable across assets. We propose that equity value represents the present value of a payment spanning over the firm's predictable lifetime. We transform the gross volatility of equity price into the underlying spanning bond's baseline risk, expecting that the former is positively associated with the premium-based latter. As an example, we demonstrate how to compute the daily risk over a year of an Apple corporate bond and three firms' spanning bonds. We show that the gross volatility of realized asset value reflects the variance of expected asset value at that distance, that options are equity bonds paid with equity, and that the difference between the option price and the present value captures the option's overcharge or the transaction cost.</p><p>Our premium-based asset risk addresses challenges that have long been challenging MAR and agency theories. In a principal-agent relationship, we show that optimal risk sharing point represents optimal payoff sharing point between the two parties, and that the agent's effort and payoff thus are observable to both parties, in contrast to the literature postulation that the agent's effort is unobservable to the principal (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Holmstrom, 1977</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Holmstrom, , 1979;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Mirrlees, 1974</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Mirrlees, , 1976))</ref>. Our risk theory also redefines firm misvaluation theories. We show that a firm always profits from equity issuance (repurchase) when its risk perceived by the market is lower (higher) than its true risk that managers are better informed of. As a major player impacting firm risk, firm management also have information advantage about future changes in firm risk.</p><p>A main disadvantage of our theory is that we need to develop complicated software to estimate asset risk. A promising future work is to examine asset risk noise using software to delineate the risk and the risk-free rate of T-bills, thereby separating the noise of inflation risk and the risk-free rate from the noise that drives the (non)depreciating value of various assets. It is also promising to develop wealth utility functions that address the major privacy challenges.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>. The three orthogonal dimensions of a longitudinal risk Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> uses firm debt as an example to illustrate the three orthogonal dimensions of a longitudinal risk that approaches zero as any one of the three dimensions approaches zero. As in <ref type="bibr">Nie (2024a)</ref>, the risk-free rate rf (t) is the expected short-term rate of the central bank capturing the inflation effect over time. The debt risk ùëü reflects the asset's risk in addition to the inflation risk. Given asset value V, the asset holder's risk over ùëá (i.e., longitudinal risk) can be expressed as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_60">ùêøùëÖ = ùëâ √ó ùëÖ (ùëü ).

Asset volatility and wealth utility: the law of diminishing marginal utility This figure shows that asset volatility decreases asset holder's wealth utility rather than asset value, as suggested by the law of diminishing marginal utility (LDMU). A confusion between asset value and wealth utility thus lends support to MAR, which argues that a diversification strategy reduces asset risk by decreasing volatility. Given asset holder's utility function U(w), LDMU gives U' &gt; 0 and U'' &lt; 0. Given asset holder's wealth w0, the figure illustrates the loss of wealth utility from asset volatility following a normal distribution, as captured by a change in w0 by x and ÔÄ≠ x (two equally possible changes). In particular, the utility loss from a decrease in the risky asset value by x (i.e., the height of brown pillar) is always greater than the utility gain from an increase in the asset value by x (i.e., the height of green pillar). The net loss in wealth utility ÔÅÑU thus can be expressed as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_62">ÔÅÑU = ‚à´ ùëàÔÇ¢(ùë§) ùëëùë§ ÔÄ≠ ‚à´ ùëàÔÇ¢(ùë§) ùëëùë§ &lt; 0. (1)</formula><p>Therefore, the more volatile the wealth (i.e., the greater the random variable x), the greater the impact of LDMU (i.e., the greater the utility loss). Also, the impact of LDMU on wealth utility is greater when we reduce the asset holder's wealth from w0 to w1. In another word, the lower the wealth, the greater the impact of LDMU.</p><p>Asset Volatility and Wealth Utility This figure illustrates the return of a corporate bond, where the risk of a payment approaches zero as maturity approaches zero, implying that the gross volatility(variance) of realized (expected) asset value approaches zero when distance approaches zero, as the gross volatility (variance) of realized (expected) asset value is positively related to asset risk over the distance.

A bond's return over maturity ùëå (ùëü ) is given by formula (13). To simplify the illustration, we can omit the macrorisk rÔÇ¢f and treat asset value as nondepreciating to account for the risk-free rate ùëü (ùë°) over T.

Given a risk noise that raises ùëü by ÔÅÑùëü , the ratio of the price change to the original price is: This figure illustrates that an asset's firm maturity is determined by the maximum marginal cost of asset holding, which reflects the firm's expected performance in the long-term. Equity price reflects the present value of the firm's lifetime performance, where the risk ùëü (ùë°) moves from current zero to maximum at maturity Te. In contrast, the risk of a firm maturity bond (FMB), which includes the macrorisk ùëüÔÇ¢ (ùë°) and the microrisk ùëü (ùë°), moves from current maximum to zero at T.

Then the total present value produced by the firm can be computed as: This figure uses a negative event to show how a (counter-)clockwise turn of a spanning bond's value curve reflects a transformation of the spanning bond's risk ùëü over Te, that is, the longitudinal risk ùëÖ (ùëü ), into the reduced current wealth or the reduced expected growth rate.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Risk sharing in a principal-agent relationship</head><p>In this section, we use our asset risk theory to calibrate the agent's skin in the game, showing how our asset risk addresses challenges that have long been facing the literature. The previous agency and contracting theories actually predict that the agent's effort remains the same even if the payoff is risk-free or near risk-free (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Jensen and Meckling, 1976;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Holmstrom, 1979)</ref>, because MAR in effect prevents scholars from properly measuring a manager's risk that is tied to her firm with untradable asset holdings. 11 12 This tied risk represents the agent's skin in the game, that motivates, thereby proxying, the agent's effort over the period, which the literature has to ignore entirely. Studies thus raise the above issue by treating the payoff or the asset value as the agent's risk when exploring optimal risk sharing rules in a principal-agent relationship. 13 They actually miss two of the three orthogonal dimensions of the longitudinal risk illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> by treating the agent's effort as unobservable to the principal (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Mirrlees, 1974</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Mirrlees, , 1976;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Holmstrom, 1979)</ref>. Our risk measure allows us to calibrate the agent's risk that reflects the agent's 11 We treat the macrorisk or T-bill risk as a form of risk-free rate when examining managerial risk in debt-like holdings. 12 We argue that <ref type="bibr">Dittmann and Maug (p. 309, 2007)</ref>, while introducing a risk premium on the firm's stock, improperly claim that the CEO cannot obtain the market risk premium when not allowed to trade in the market. Instead, the trading restriction forces the CEO to take the risk premium that represents the CEO's risk. 13 See, for example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Holmstrom (1977)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Harris and Raviv (1976)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Mirrlees (1974</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Mirrlees ( , 1976))</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Stiglitz (1975</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">), Williamson (1975)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Wilson (1968</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">), Luenberger (1969)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Gjesdal (1976)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Spence and Zeckhauser (1971)</ref>, <ref type="bibr">Jensen and</ref><ref type="bibr">Meckling (1976, 1979)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Lambert and Larcker (1986)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Pratt (1964)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Pratt and Zeckhauser (1987)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Smith and Zimmerman (1976)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Noreen and Wolfson (1981)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Aboody (1996)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Carpenter (2000)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Kahl, Liu, and Longstaff (2003)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Hall and Murphy (2002)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Murphy (1985)</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Ross (1973)</ref>.</p></div>			</div>
