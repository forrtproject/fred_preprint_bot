<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The number of dogs in Western countries has increased over the past 2 decades, whereas the number of children has remained stable or decreased. Many dog owners, including those with children, say that their pets are more important to them than any human. Presumably, the declining fertility rates contribute to the increasing value of dogs in the lives of people, and dogs fill an empty niche. The companion dog cultural runaway theory posits that the change in dog-keeping habits has both biological and cultural evolutionary roots. Human ancestors developed a cooperative breeding system 2 million years ago, with the community aiding in child-rearing. Because people currently do not perceive the level of social support and trust to which they are biologically adapted, they seek alternatives. One coping strategy may involve transferring genetically based prosocial attitudes, such as the tendency to engage in parental behavior, to dogs. Western culture supports this shift and portrays dog ownership positively. Moreover, the biological evolution of dogs, with the spread of short-headed, small-sized lapdogs, also contributes to them being viewed as "children." Dogs may facilitate or hinder the restoration of human network complexity, but this area is currently largely unexplored.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The rising global demand for pet food highlights the growing importance of pets, with expenditures increasing from less than $30 billion in 2000 to $102 billion in 2020. In addition to higher disposable income, this growth is largely attributed to the humanization of pets <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Hobbs et al., 2024)</ref>, which can have positive outcomes because it often motivates owners to prioritize providing their pets with a standard of food and comfort comparable to their own. Indeed, virtually everyone in convenience samples (i.e., populations readily available to researchers) considers their dog a member of the family (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Kubinyi et al., 2009)</ref>. Even in a recent nationally representative survey in Hungary, a substantial 66% of respondents shared this view <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Kubinyi &amp; Varga, 2023)</ref>. When asked to list their family members, many mention their animals <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Davies &amp; Davies, 2008)</ref>. The never-married, divorced, widowed and remarried people, childless couples, newlyweds, and empty nesters are the most attached to their dogs and the most likely to anthropomorphize them <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Albert &amp; Bulcroft, 1988)</ref>. Many owners refer to themselves as pet parents and describe their pets as "fur babies," suggesting, at least in theory, that they care for their dogs with similar devotion and love as for children <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Volsche, 2021)</ref>. But perhaps the most surprising is that, in a Hungarian convenience sample, 68% of dog owners without children agreed with the statement that their dog means more to them than any human, and this percentage was not much lower at 52% for owners with children <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Szánthó et al., 2017)</ref>. Because young, educated women living in cities were overrepresented in the convenience </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Link Between Companion Dogs and Human Fertility Rates</head><p>Referring to dogs as family members and fur babies may seem like a semantic change, but valuing dogs more highly than anyone else, even one's own children, indicates a significant cultural shift. This might be linked to decreasing human fertility rates: 5.3 to 2.3 births per woman between 1963 and 2023 globally <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Roser, 2014)</ref>. The data presented in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> suggest that dog keeping negatively affects the desire to have children. Pope Francis shares this view: "Today . . . we see a form of selfishness. . . . We see that some people do not want to have a child . . . but they have dogs and cats that take the place of children" (BBC, 2022). There are indeed childless owners who have made it clear that their dog provided a satisfying substitute for a child <ref type="bibr">(Laurent-Simpson, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Shir-Vertesh, 2012)</ref>. Women who have positive attitudes toward their dogs tend to have a more negative attitude toward motherhood, and mothers with dogs perceive motherhood as more burdensome, which may prevent them from having more children <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Temesi et al., 2020)</ref>. Moreover, a dog can contribute to reducing the number of children not only by taking over the role of a child (single child or sibling) but also by distracting attention from the potential coparent. Investing a significant amount of time, money, and emotional commitment in a pet may be linked to limited resources to maintain a romantic relationship. The lack of a partner is the leading reason for not having children <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Miettinen et al., 2015)</ref>. This effect might be moderated by owners' anxious attachment style toward other people <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Northrope et al., 2024)</ref>. However, the number of people who regard their dog as a substitute for children is potentially low <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Gillet et al., 2024)</ref>. In contrast, several studies suggest that dog ownership is positively, rather than negatively, related to fertility because families with children are more likely to own dogs <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Albert &amp; Bulcroft, 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Kubinyi &amp; Varga, 2023)</ref>. A simple explanation for this correlation is that larger families often have larger homes, providing more space for a dog. But it is also possible that dog ownership may increase biological fitness (i.e., having more children). Given that women tend to find men with dogs more attractive <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Tifferet et al., 2013)</ref>, male dog owners may have a higher likelihood of fathering children. Furthermore, assessing a partner's level of involvement in care responsibilities may increase the stability and, thus, the number of children in future families. <ref type="bibr">Shir-Vertesh (2012)</ref> found that half of the young couples in their study referred to their pet as a "prechild," suggesting that the pet is seen as a preparatory step to having children. Decisions about family size are influenced by many factors, including relationship status, economic situation, cultural norms, and access to childcare assistance. Accordingly, it is probably not that increasing dog ownership and changing attitudes affect human fertility but rather the other way around-that declining fertility rates contribute to the growing value of dogs in the lives of people. In other words, dogs do not actively replace children in many people's lives; they fill an empty niche. Testing this hypothesis would require a multidisciplinary approach, combining quantitative data analysis, such as correlational studies involving fertility rates, dog ownership, and attitudes toward dogs in longitudinal and cross-sectional analyses as well as qualitative methods (e.g., by conducting in-depth interviews in societies with varying fertility rates about the role of dogs in family structures).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Implications for Human Relationships</head><p>Humans prefer social interactions with kin over nonkin. The decrease in the fertility rate has led to a decrease in the number of relatives. Using the example of David-Barrett ( <ref type="formula">2019</ref>), if a woman raises two children instead of five, the number of same-generation relatives (siblings and cousins) is reduced from 44 to 5, with serious consequences for human social networks. In addition, a number of other factors, such as increased mobility, make the maintenance of personal relationships difficult and undermine the formation of stable, supportive communities. This is of global importance because people with lower social integration have a significantly higher risk of death than people with stronger social connections <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Holt-Lunstad et al., 2010)</ref>. Social inclusion is better for health than not smoking, exercising, and eating healthily. The lack of social support from relatives can be alleviated with friends, although it might not always be sufficient for an individual to have a secure social network. Sociologists measure the quality of a social network by interconnected relationships, often referred to as "closed triangles," in which all participants know each other. Family members have typically known each other since birth, which allows their relationships to be characterized by a large number of closed triangles. This interconnectedness creates a "safety net," whereby strains in one relationship can be mitigated by others. It fosters mutual understanding, reduces the likelihood of miscommunication, promotes accountability by discouraging misbehavior through higher visibility, strengthens social identity, and enhances the sense of belonging. In contrast, in friendship networks, a person's friends (from elementary school, high school, soccer club, etc.) may not know each other and do not form closed triangles. This phenomenon can also be one of the explanations for the current increase in social alienation because one has to navigate separate, unconnected relationships, which can lead to the compartmentalization of one's life <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(David-Barrett, 2019)</ref>. The adverse effect can be offset if friends find a common area of interest. If, for example, they are all dog owners and like to walk dogs together, this leads to an increase in closed triangles and thus an increase in the sense of security and reliability in their social network. The number of closed triangles can also be increased by adopting nonhuman "friends" or "family members" (i.e., pets). The impact of pets on social networks may be even more pronounced in smaller families, in which the addition of a pet may have a relatively greater impact on social dynamics (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>). On the other hand, owning a dog can sometimes negatively impact human relationships because it is not always without challenges. Behavioral issues such as aggression, excessive barking, fearfulness, separation anxiety, and chronic illnesses affect at least one third of dogs <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Meyer et al., 2023)</ref>. These problems can cause significant stress for owners and may lead to social isolation by limiting participation in social activities. Additionally, relying exclusively on a dog for emotional security and companionship can contribute to social withdrawal and may mask undiagnosed or untreated mentalhealth conditions, such as anxiety or depression. These issues can be further exacerbated if the pet becomes ill or passes away. Overall, keeping dogs as family members or for recreational purposes may either facilitate (catalyze) or hinder (inhibit) the restoration of human network complexity, yet this area remains largely unexplored. Future studies should include surveys targeting both dog owners and non-dog owners to gather data on the number and quality of human relationships, perceived emotional reliance on pets, and participation in pet-related social activities across different cultures. Longitudinal studies could further examine how acquiring or losing a dog affects social networks and psychological wellbeing over time. Additionally, investigating the impact of other types of pets-such as cats, birds, small mammals, and reptiles-on social networks could provide valuable insights.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Companion Dog Cultural Runaway Theory</head><p>The view of dogs as family members in Western cultures has significantly increased ("run away") in the past decades and has gone from a relatively rare phenomenon to a common one. This trend may be explained by the hypothesis that people are turning to dogs as a coping strategy because of declining human fertility and other demographic and sociocultural changes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>). The change in dog-keeping habits has both biological and cultural evolutionary roots. The construction of this theory is outlined below. Two million years ago, the ancestors of modern humans (Homo genus) lived in cohesive groups of close relatives. The mothers gave birth to slow-maturing, large-brained offspring that required a significant energy investment, but the time interval between births was short. This evolutionary development was possible only because Homo mothers, unlike nonhuman apes, relied on the support of the rest of the group care for their offspring. Cooperative breeding and alloparenting (i.e., when individuals other than the biological parents contribute to the care and upbringing of offspring) were fundamental to the evolutionary success of the human species. Intense hypersociality and prosociality, mostly manifested in caring for others, merged with the advanced cognitive system already characteristic of the ape system <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Burkart et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Hrdy &amp; Burkart, 2020)</ref>. As a legacy of this particular biological evolution, humans today still have a latent, sometimes unrecognized desire to care for others and to receive unconditional social support ("unconditional love"). Since the Agricultural Revolution (12,000-14,000 years ago), however, archaic communities have begun to erode. The Industrial Revolution (18th and 19th centuries) accelerated the process. In recent decades, socioeconomic changes, including increased urbanization, an aging population, living in small households, social isolation, changes in family structures, digital communication, ideological changes, work-life imbalances, mobility, and migration (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>), have almost eliminated traditional kinship-based (emotional and practical) support systems. In a recent study, 87% of Hungarian adults reported no contact with children of preschool age (based on the data set of <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Kubinyi &amp; Varga, 2023)</ref>, which is significantly different from the norms of archaic groups, in which intergenerational interactions were frequent, and child-rearing was a shared responsibility among extended family members and the broader community <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Hrdy &amp; Burkart, 2020)</ref>. Therefore, if a Homo mother does not feel social support, she often refuses to raise a child. Given the high dependence of mothers on alloparental assistance, the perceived lack of social support may be one factor contributing to declining fertility <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Hrdy &amp; Burkart, 2020)</ref>. Currently many people do not perceive the level of social support to which they are biologically adapted, which may lead to social deprivation, loneliness, stress-related illnesses, and depression (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">David-Barrett, 2019)</ref>. One coping strategy could involve transferring the genetically based prosocial tendency to seek relationships and parental behavior to another target: pets-and primarily dogs because of their human-like sociocognitive skills, attraction to humans, tolerance/need of physical contact, tractability, and adaptability (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Topál et al., 2009)</ref>. Although emotional attachment to dogs has existed in human societies for thousands of years, it has been subjected to negative and hostile attitudes from monotheistic religions. This changed in the late Middle Ages but primarily the economic elite-the aristocracy and bourgeoisie-could afford to keep dogs for companionship, recreation, or as status symbols <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Menache, 1998)</ref>. Later, changes in norms and economic prosperity opened up the possibility of keeping dogs for social purposes and not only for utility to almost all. Dogs can play multiple roles in a human environment that lacks kinship support. Because of their human-like social and cognitive abilities, they can be "alloparents," providing emotional support and companionship. They can also act as surrogate children because of their dependency on humans, thus providing humans with the opportunity to nurture someone and feel a sense of parental love and care. They can be the children's "siblings" or playmates who keep the children company. Their versatility contributes to the strong emotional attachment and special position they occupy in the lives of their human peers. This does not exclude the fact that many still see dogs as domestic animals kept for utilitarian purposes or as a hobby <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Gillet et al., 2024)</ref>. Culture has a profound impact on dog keeping. For example, in Saudi Arabia, a predominantly Muslim country, there is one companion dog for every 1,000 people, whereas in the United States, there are 225 dogs per 1,000 people <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Herzog &amp; Rowan, 2019)</ref>. Cultural beliefs (memes) have developed that influence companion animal ownership. Western-style media often highlight the mental-and physical-health benefits of dog ownership, although these effects are not universal (reviewed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Herzog, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Rodriguez et al., 2021)</ref>. Generational shifts may also contribute to cultural changes; for example, in China, younger individuals are more inclined to prefer dog and cat videos <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Zhang et al., 2024)</ref>. The human biological and cultural evolution of dog keeping directly affects the biological evolution of dogs, which in turn affects cultural evolution. Because of specific breeding practices, dogs have become shorter-nosed and smaller over the past 2 decades, presumably because dog owners increasingly prefer dogs that look like babies despite their many health problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Teng et al., 2016)</ref>. These dogs are characterized by the baby schema: large, round head, high forehead, short nose, big eyes, and cuddly size. Moreover, their behavior also suggests helplessness and dependence <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Ujfalussy et al., 2023)</ref>. The perceived resemblance of dogs to babies likely plays a role in their increasing acceptance as family members. Culture conveys the message that brachycephalic dogs showing infantile features are "cute" and fashionable but largely ignores welfare issues <ref type="bibr">(Bognár &amp; Kubinyi, 2023)</ref>. The demand for specific breeds can lead not only to an increase in health issues but also behavioral problems in these breeds, contributing to the abandonment or surrender of dogs when the trend wanes. Not all dogs adapt well to living in human families or urbanized environments. Some may suffer because of confinement, noise, poor socialization, owner-related factors such as stress, "civilization diseases" such as diabetes, and genetic predispositions. Certain behaviors for which canines were historically bred (e.g., aggression in terriers, the herding propensity in herding dogs) are now viewed as undesirable by most dog owners. In extreme cases, owners keep dogs as child surrogates-dressing them in clothes, pushing them in baby buggies, frequently holding them in their arms, and showering them with kisses and hugs-without considering the animals' needs. Breeders should prioritize selecting for traits that promote adaptability and well-being, whereas owners should focus on providing proper training, autonomy, and care (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Meyer et al., 2023)</ref>. ). Humans, as cooperative breeders, have an innate biological evolutionary tendency to connect with and care for others, particularly the youngest generation. In modern societies marked by increasing social alienation, this tendency can be partially fulfilled through relationships with dogs and supported by cultural evolutionary processes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>The trends in companion dog ownership suggest that, in Western cultures, there is a significant gap in caregiving and acceptance, which dogs may partially fill. Since this void was traditionally occupied by human relationships, it raises the question of whether it would be more beneficial for society if individuals with unfulfilled caregiving instincts redirected these toward humans, primarily children. For example, could childless or elderly people become involved in the daily care of neighboring children who may be receiving insufficient attention? In this way, future parents could also get genuine community support to raise their children. Dogs can also participate in these endeavors. A well-socialized dog can connect people and promote children's development. On the other hand, those who wish to continue keeping dogs should remember that dogs can act as "social glue" within a neighborhood, facilitating positive interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Wood et al., 2015)</ref>. It is essential that a dog actually strengthens an individual's social network and support system rather than diminishing it.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Herzog, H. (2021)</ref>.
