<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Anger is prevalent in chronic pain (CP), often co-occurring with heightened distress and disability. The complexity of the anger construct manifests in heterogeneity of how anger is experienced, expressed, and regulated. Nevertheless, most work does not consider the interrelationships between multiple dimensions of anger, limiting understanding of how anger might differentially contribute to pain outcomes. Here, various anger metrics and latent profile analysis (LPA) were utilized to identify disparate anger profiles in people with CP.</p><p>Whether these profiles associated cross-sectionally and longitudinally with pain outcomes was subsequently examined. Data was collected from 735 treatment-seeking adult patients with CP of varied etiologies, of which 242 also completed follow-up assessments about 5 months after baseline. Anger measures included state and trait anger, anger expression (angerin, anger-out), anger control (control-in, control-out), and perceived injustice. Pain outcomes included pain-intensity, distribution, interference, and behavior, and physical function. LPA identified four distinct anger profiles characterized by the combination of varying levels (low, medium, high) of anger and of perceived injustice. These profiles significantly associated with pain outcomes at both baseline and follow-up, above and beyond anxiety and depression.</p><p>Profiles with medium-to-high levels of both anger (state, trait, and expression) and perceived injustice predicted the worst pain outcomes, suggesting that injustice-based profiling should be prioritized for anger-related stratification of risk in CP. The mechanistic and prognostic value of these anger profiles suggests that early assessment could enhance long-term treatment planning and advance personalized pain care, further emphasizing the need for tailored, anger-focused, patient-specific interventions.</p><p>Perspectives: This study demonstrates that multidimensional anger profiles, particularly those marked by higher perceived injustice, are linked to more severe and persistent high impact chronic pain. Identifying these profiles may facilitate early clinical screening for at-risk patients, personalized emotion-focused interventions, and potentially prevent progression to high-impact chronic pain and long-term disability.</p></div>

Moreover, emotional factors seem to critically shape CP outcomes, influencing symptom severity and patients' coping abilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> .</p><p>Among emotions linked to CP, anger is particularly salient <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> , with about 70% of patients frequently experiencing anger <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> . Anger is not a unidimensional construct; instead, it encompasses elements such as state anger (transient emotional reactions), trait anger (a stable tendency toward anger), various modes of expression, such as anger-in (suppressed anger) and anger-out (externalized anger) and various regulation modes of both the experience and expression of anger, also referred to as anger control <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> . Research has consistently shown that heightened anger in CP, whether in its state, trait, or expressive forms, is associated with worsened pain outcomes, including greater pain intensity, heightened negative emotional experiences, and increased disability, which restricts social participation and diminishes overall quality of life <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> . Recently, perceived injustice -an anger-related cognitive factor defined by maladaptive appraisals of unfair treatment and irreparable loss <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> -has been linked to greater distress, higher pain, and impaired coping capabilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> .</p><p>Despite growing recognition of the multidimensional nature of anger, most research, especially in CP, focuses on isolated components, without fully examining the interplay between various anger dimensions. This approach simplifies anger's role in CP, and neglects the possibility that distinct combinations of anger dimensions may have differential effects on pain-related outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> . A recent systematic review and meta-analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> highlights the complexity of the interaction between anger and pain, revealing, for example, that state anger, which fluctuates with situational variability, is closely linked to moment-to-moment pain experiences, while anger-in is more strongly associated with pain-related disability.</p><p>Identifying disparate multidimensional-based anger profiles could enable clinicians to tailor psychosocial interventions to specific patient subgroups, thereby improving patient outcomes.</p><p>Therefore, the present study sought to move beyond examining isolated dimensions of anger towards examining the complex interrelationships between several dimensions of anger, in CP. To this end, latent profile analysis (LPA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> was utilized to identify distinct underlying profiles of anger in treatment-seeking adults with CP, and examined how these profiles relate to key pain-related outcomes. LPA, a data-driven, person-centered statistical approach, was used to uncover clinically meaningful subgroups based on unique combinations of state and trait anger, anger expression (anger-in and anger-out), anger control (control-in and controlout), and perceived injustice. This approach represents a crucial step toward advancing precision medicine in CP by enabling more targeted psychological assessments and interventions. We hypothesized that distinct anger profiles would emerge and that these profiles would (i) capture meaningful heterogeneity in anger dimensions within a CP population, (ii) be associated with variability in pain-related outcomes at baseline, above and beyond the emotional factors of anxiety and depression, and (iii) predict pain outcomes over time. By incorporating both cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses, the study addresses a key gap in the literature -namely, the absence of empirically derived anger typologies that capture the dynamic and multidimensional role of anger in CP.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Procedure and Participants</head><p>Data was collected from patients receiving care at the Stanford Pain Management Centers.</p><p>Patients completed surveys as part of their routine clinical care via Stanford University's CHOIR a . CHOIR is a learning health system administering electronic surveys assessing selfreported demographic information, pain characteristics, and multiple domains of health status in real-world clinical settings <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> . Survey completion is encouraged, but not mandatory, thus patients may choose not to respond to certain items or assessments. The health status assessments are mostly based on the National Institute of Health's Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> . Using computerized adaptive testing allows for automatically selecting only a subset of items from each PROMIS item bank until resulting measurements meet preset criteria for standard errors <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> . Typically, no more than eight items are selected, though a minimum of 4 is required. PROMIS items are commonly rated on a 5-point frequency scale ranging from 1 (never) to 5 (always). The raw sum scores are then transformed into standardized T-scores, where the mean (M) is 50 and represents the normative mean of the U.S. general population and the standard deviation (SD) is 10. Higher T scores represent more of the measured construct.</p><p>Between August 2018 and February 2019, patients were further presented with an additional optional survey to complete, which included the State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory version 2 (STAXI-2) 10 assessments (further details below). They were also informed that at the end of this additional survey, they will have the opportunity to enlist for a follow-up survey including the same assessments, which will be sent 3 months later. Patients were further informed that those completing the additional surveys will be included in a raffle for In all, baseline timepoint included 735 patients. Of these, 242 patients chose to complete the follow-up timepoint, with an average interval of 141±68 (M±SD) days between timepoints.</p><p>An additional 52 patients at baseline and 3 patients at follow-up did not complete the additional survey and were excluded.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Anger assessments</head><p>State-like anger was assessed using the PROMIS Anger assessment <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> . This measure evaluates the respondent's frequency and intensity of feeling angry, in the past 7 days. Scores are represented in T-scores (see General Procedure and Participants section).</p><p>Trait anger was measured using the Trait Anger Scale, a component of the STAXI-2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> . This subscale assesses the general disposition to experience anger, reflecting the individual's propensity to perceive situations as frustrating or annoying and to respond with anger over time. This scale includes ten items rated on a 4-point frequency scale ranging from 1 (almost never) to 4 (almost always). Scores are summed to produce a total score ranging from 10-40, with higher scores indicating a greater trait tendency to be angry.</p><p>Anger expression and anger control were assessed using the Anger Expression Inventory, also part of the STAXI-2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> . These subscales evaluate how individuals typically express and control their anger, including anger-in (suppression), anger-out (expression), anger control-in (control of suppression), and anger control-out (control of outward expression). Each subscale consists of eight items rated on a 4-point frequency scale from 1 (almost never) to 4 (almost always). Scores are then summed to produce a total score ranging from 8-32, with higher scores indicating greater tendencies in that particular subscale.</p><p>Injustice experience was assessed using the Injustice Experience Questionnaire (IEQ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> . The IEQ measures the extent to which individuals perceive their medical condition as unjust, focusing on two dimensions: unfairness/blame and severity/irreparability of loss. The questionnaire consists of twelve items rated on a 5-point frequency scale from 0 (never) to 4 (all the time). Scores from the six items in each dimension are summed, ranging from 0 to 24, with higher scores indicating a stronger perception of injustice and attribution of blame (unfairness/blame subscale) or a heightened sense of severity and irreversibility of the loss associated with the health condition (severity/irreparability subscale).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pain-related assessments</head><p>The pain distribution in the body was assessed using the CHOIR body map <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> , a schema of the body divided into 74 symmetrical segments (36 on the front and 38 on the back). Participants marked the segments where they experienced pain. Both male and female versions of the body map were available; participants who did not specify their gender were given the female version by default. The total pain distribution was calculated by counting the number of marked segments, yielding a score from 0 to 74.</p><p>A composite score of pain intensity was calculated by averaging three self-reported measures for worst and average pain in the last 7 days and current pain. These measures used the common 0-10 Numerical Rating Scale (NRS), where 0 represents "no pain" and 10 indicates "the worst pain imaginable" <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> . Pain duration was determined based on the number of months since the onset of CP, as self-reported by the patients. PROMIS-based instruments were utilized to measure pain interference, pain behavior, and physical function, including upper body and mobility tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> . Pain interference assessed the extent by which pain hinders daily activities and impacts quality of life in the past 7 days, using a 5-point Likert scale from 1 (Not at all) to 5 (Very much). Pain behavior assessed the frequency of observable pain-related actions (e.g., grimacing, guarding) in the past 7 days, using the same 5-point scale. Physical function was evaluated separately for ability to perform upper body and mobility tasks in the past 7 days, rated on a 5-point scale from 1 (Unable to do) to 5 (Without any difficulty). All scores are represented in T-scores (see General Procedure and Participants section).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Negative affect assessments</head><p>PROMIS-based instruments were also utilized to measure negative affect-related factors, namely anxiety and depression <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> . Each measure evaluates the frequency and intensity of anxious and depressive feelings experienced over the past 7 days, rated on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (Never) to 5 (Always). All scores are represented in T-scores (see General Procedure and Participants section).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Analysis</head><p>Latent Profile Analysis (LPA) was computed using MPlus ver. 8.4 <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> to identify distinct anger profiles based on the anger measures at baseline. LPA is a data-driven person-centered mixture-model method frequently utilized to identify subtypes of homogeneous latent subgroups within a population <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> . This iterative technique aggregates similar response profiles to form distinct subgroups or classes of patient profiles. Latent profile solutions ranging from 2 to 5 profiles were tested to identify the best-fitting model. Model selection was guided by multiple fit indices, including the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), sample size-adjusted BIC (SABIC), Lo-Mendell-Rubin adjusted likelihood ratio test (LRT), bootstrap likelihood ratio test (BLRT), profile size, and entropy <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> . AIC and BIC are information criteria used to compare model fit, with lower values indicating a better fit. Entropy, which ranges from 0 to 1, is considered acceptable when exceeding 0.80, indicating clear profile classification. Although there is no definitive standard for profile size, profiles representing less than 5% of the sample may raise concerns about their validity due to limited representation. The LRT compares the current model to one with one fewer profile, with a non-significant result (p &gt; .05) suggesting the simpler (most parsimonious) model is preferable. Ultimately, the selection of the final number of profiles was based on theoretical relevance and the interpretability of the profiles. Missing data were addressed using a maximum likelihood estimator, which is robust to data non-normality A total of eight measures of anger were selected for inclusion in the LPA to provide a comprehensive overview of the multidimensional construct of anger. These measures encompass: state-like (PROMIS) anger, trait anger, anger expression out, anger expression in, anger control out, anger control in, and IEQ's severity/irreparability of loss, and unfairness/blame sub-scales.</p><p>Analysis of variance (ANOVA) were conducted using R 34 to examine differences in anger dimensions across profiles and to investigate the relationship between latent anger profiles and pain-related symptoms at baseline and follow-up. At baseline, a stepwise approach in the ANCOVA (analysis of covariance) models was employed to analyze the effect of anger profiles on pain outcomes, incrementally controlling for covariates. At first, the interaction between pain variables and anger profiles was tested, then progressively added sociodemographic factors (age, sex, education), clinical variables (pain duration), and negative affect covariates (anxiety, depression) across models. An exploration was conducted to consider which profiles are more likely to meet criteria for High Impact Chronic Pain (HICP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref> by applying the established clinical threshold of a PROMIS Pain Interference Tscore ≥ 65 <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref> . To test the relationship between anger profiles and HICP in more detail, the number and proportion of individuals with PROMIS-PI T-scores ≥ 65 within each profile was calculated and a chi-square test was conducted to assess differences across groups.</p><p>At follow-up, due to limited power, only the covariate "days between timepoints" was controlled for. Additionally, to explore whether there is a significant change between baseline and follow-up in pain outcomes depending on baseline anger profiles, analyses were conducted using the same subsample of participants (N=242) who provided responses at both baseline and follow-up b . An ANCOVAs was run with timepoints and anger profiles as factors, incorporating the number of days between timepoints as a covariate. Bonferroni correction was applied to all post hoc pairwise analyses to account for the number of multiple comparisons.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample Characteristics</head><p>The majority of the sample were female (70.3%) adults (51.56 years old on average), and highly educated (18.20 years of education on average). Most identified as White (60.1%) and Non-Hispanic/Non-Latino (80.3%), and over half were living with a partner (58.64%). At follow-up, the sample characteristics remained similar (see Table <ref type="table">1</ref>).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Latent profile analysis procedure</head><p>LPA was run for 1-5 profile models including the anger indicator variables and assessed for model fit and clinical relevance (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>). The LMR p-value changed from significant to non-significant when transitioning from the 4-to 5-profile model. Given this result, the 4profile model and the models above and below (3-and 5-profile models) were examined for pragmatic evaluation. The 4-profile solution was preferred over the 3-profile solution because the latter failed to identify a distinct high anger and injustice group, which emerged as a potentially important clinical subgroup with 54 subjects in the 4-profile solution. The 5profile solution had a less preferable entropy value and needlessly split the low anger and low injustice subgroup (see descriptions in the next section) into two subgroups. AIC, BIC, and SABIC were all acceptable for the 4-profile solution. Additionally, classification probabilities for the 4-profile model indicated high assignment accuracy across groups, with diagonal probabilities ranging from 88.3% to 95.1%, further supporting its suitability (see Table <ref type="table">S1</ref>).</p><p>Hence, the 4-profile model was chosen, as it satisfied parsimony, efficiency, interpretability, and its ability to identify four discrete anger profiles. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Characteristics of identified anger profiles</head><p>The four profiles were labeled based on their relative characteristics across all the angerrelated measures (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref>, and    <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">S3</ref> for descriptive statistics of socio-demographic, clinical, and negative affect covariates by anger profile).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Effect of anger profiles on pain outcomes</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pain outcomes at baseline</head><p>Anger profiles significantly moderated outcomes across all pain assessments (Fs &gt; 10.74, ps &lt; .001, ηp² &gt; 0.042; Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref>, and Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">S4</ref>). Descriptively, the HAHI profile reported the most severe pain outcomes, including higher pain intensity, greater pain interference, more pain behaviors, more body regions in pain, and poorer physical function in both mobility and upper body tasks. In contrast, the LALI profile demonstrated the least severe pain outcomes, with lower pain intensity, less pain interference, fewer pain behaviors, and better physical function. While the MAMI and MALI profiles were intermediates in terms of their anger-related profiling, MAMI had worse scores in all pain outcomes compared to MALI. In fact, MAMI did not differ in any of the pain outcomes from HAHI, while MALI did not differ in any of them from LALI. In other words, all pairwise comparisons were significant (ps &lt; .05) between profiles when low injustice profiles were compared to medium or high injustice profiles (i.e., LALI vs. MAMI; LALI vs. HAHI; MALI vs. MAMI; MALI vs. HAHI; see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">S4</ref>).   <ref type="table">5</ref>). The only exception was the extent of pain distribution in the body, where the inclusion of negative affect covariates rendered the effect non-significant (F = 2.02, p = .110, ηp² = 0.008). While including negative affect covariates generally reduced effect sizes, anger profiles continued to independently influence most pain-related measures.</p><p>Table <ref type="table">5</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pain outcomes at follow-up</head><p>At follow-up, anger profiles significantly predicted pain outcomes across most measures (see Table <ref type="table">6</ref>, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">3</ref>). Anger profiles moderated pain intensity, pain interference, pain behavior, and physical function tasks (Fs &gt; 3.50, ps &lt; .05, ηp² &gt; 0.042), while no significant effects were observed for pain distribution (F = 2.60, p = .053, ηp² = 0.032). Post hoc pairwise comparisons revealed significant differences in pain measurements primarily between lowinjustice profiles (LALI, MALI) vs. medium and high injustice profiles (MAMI, HAHI), although the pattern was less well-defined when compared to baseline. Specifically, significant differences were observed for LALI vs. MAMI, LALI vs. HAHI, and, in some cases, MALI vs. MAMI or MALI vs. HAHI (corrected ps &lt; .05), depending on the pain measure. For instance, pain intensity showed significant differences for LALI vs. MAMI and LALI vs. HAHI, while pain interference revealed broader differences, including significant contrasts between MAMI and HAHI. However, no significant differences were found for pain distribution across all pairwise comparisons (see Table <ref type="table">S5</ref>).  showed a significant link between anger profiles and continued high pain interference, χ²(3) = 15.63, p &lt; .001, indicating that individuals with higher perceived injustice were more likely to experience ongoing pain-related disruption.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pain outcomes over time (baseline vs. follow up)</head><p>Considering both timepoints, the effects of anger profiles were robust across all pain variables (Fs &gt; 3.8, ps &lt; .05, ηp 2 &gt; .023; see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">7</ref>). In contrast, the main effects of timepoints (baseline vs. follow-up) significantly impacted only pain intensity and pain behavior, that were reduced over time (Fs &gt; 11.3, ps &lt; .001, ηp 2 =.049). In contrast, pain distribution, pain interference, and physical function (mobility and upper body) were not significantly affected by time alone (Fs &lt; 0.9, ps &gt; .34, ηp 2 &lt;.002). Notably, no significant interaction effects between anger profiles and timepoints were observed (Fs &lt; 0.94, ps &gt; .42, ηp 2 &lt;.006),</p><p>indicating that the temporal changes in pain intensity and behavior were consistent across profiles. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Discussion</head><p>Although anger is an adaptive emotion that enables individuals to respond to threats, to personal insults and breaches of social norms and injustices <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> , it has been linked to increased symptom severity in context of CP <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> . However, much of the existing research has failed to consider the interrelationships between multiple dimensions of anger <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> , potentially obscuring mechanistic and clinically relevant distinctions between various (mal)adaptive anger responses. The present study addresses this gap by using LPA to examine whether distinct anger profiles may emerge from several anger-related metrics, describing the pattern of relationships between these various anger-related metrics and illustrating the extent by which these profiles associate with pain outcomes at different timepoints. Consistent with hypotheses, four profiles were identified: Low Anger / Low Injustice (LALI), Medium Anger / Low Injustice (MALI), Medium Anger / Medium Injustice (MAMI), and High Anger / High Injustice (HAHI). These profiles demonstrated significant associations with pain measures, both at baseline and follow-up, revealing how data-driven combinations of anger dimensions, predict pain symptoms and HICP in the short and long term. Importantly, these associations persisted beyond the influence of commonly assessed emotional distress symptoms, namely anxiety and depression, supporting the unique contribution of anger to CP outcomes and their trajectories, and underscoring the need of regular assessment of anger-related metrics, especially perceived injustice, in clinical and research settings. These findings thus have important mechanistic and clinical implications.</p><p>The largest group labeled as LALI (49% of sample at baseline) was characterized by lowest anger, highest anger control, and minimal perceived injustice, and was associated with the least severe pain outcomes at baseline and follow-up, including lower pain intensity, less interference, and better physical function. This profile reflects an adaptive emotional pattern, suggesting that relatively high anger regulation may operate as a stable dispositional trait rather than solely a response to provocation or stress. This perspective is consistent with research indicating that effective anger regulation can be proactive, rather than solely reactive to threat or injustice <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39</ref> . The profile labeled MALI (20%) exhibited medium anger, reduced anger control, and low perceived injustice, with low pain outcomes, similar to those of LALI.</p><p>This combination suggests that potential sources of anger in individuals within this profile may be distinct from perceptions of injustice related to their medical condition, potentially arising from non-pain-related threats, stress, frustration, or other situational factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> . While their anger is notable, their regulatory capacities are low, and yet this seems to be independent from their chronic pain as their pain outcomes remain relatively low. The profile labeled MAMI (24%) showed medium anger and average levels of anger expression and anger control, coupled with medium perceived injustice, resulting in more severe pain outcomes compared to LALI and MALI. This pattern underscores the amplifying effect of maladaptive cognitive processes such as perceived injustice, even in the absence of high levels of anger.</p><p>Lastly, the HAHI profile (7%) combined highest levels of anger with lowest levels of anger control, and with highest levels of perceived injustice, and demonstrated the most severe pain outcomes. This profile captures a maladaptive response to chronic pain, where intense anger and high perceived injustice seem to join forces to exacerbate symptoms in the potential absence of adequate regulatory control.</p><p>Although the anger profiles reveal a descriptive pain gradient, not all dimensions of anger were equally effective in differentiating pain outcomes. Among these, perceived injustice, as measured here by the IEQ and framed in context of patients' medical condition <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40</ref> , emerged as particularly significant. At baseline, profiles with lower perceived injustice (i.e., LALI and MALI) consistently demonstrated better pain outcomes compared to those with medium-tohigh perceived injustice (i.e., MAMI and HAHI), highlighting its pivotal role in CP <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41</ref> . This pattern appears to remain consistent over time, as indicated by the follow-up results. Perceived injustice reflects cognitive appraisals of unfairness, victimization, and irreparable loss that seem to exacerbate CP symptoms. These appraisals may foster further maladaptive processes such as rumination and magnification, which intensify emotional reactivity, hypervigilance, and ultimately pain interference and disability <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> . These mechanisms are particularly important in understanding the progression to HICP, where the interplay of cognitive and emotional factors seems to contribute to the most severe levels of disability <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref> . Indeed, individuals with HICP <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> are characterized by the most severe functional limitations among people with CP, including marked reductions in workforce participation and elevated healthcare utilization and costs <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43</ref> . Identifying individuals at risk for HICP is crucial for effective triaging and treatment within a person-centered healthcare framework.</p><p>Consistent with this, the medium-to-high injustice profiles (i.e., MAMI and HAHI) included substantially larger proportions of individuals with HICP, further emphasizing the clinical implications of the findings.</p><p>Previous findings generally align with current results, highlighting perceived injustice as a key factor in CP outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref> . Systematic reviews and meta-analyses have shown that perceived injustice is consistently associated with worse pain intensity, greater physical disability, pain interference and overall functional impairment <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47</ref> . For example, a recent meta-analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47</ref> reported that the prevalence of high perceived injustice ranged from 23% to 77% in CP patients, with those reporting such levels of perceived injustice exhibiting significantly higher psychological distress. Importantly, findings suggest that medium-to-high anger, whether state or trait anger as an example, is not necessarily maladaptive, at least not in terms of measured pain outcomes; rather, it is the combination of anger with medium-to-high levels of perceived injustice that drives poorer pain outcomes. In fact, as long as one does not succumb to appraisals of injustice, having moderate levels of anger seems fine, as evident in the MALI profile. This distinction refines prior work, highlighting the need to consider the interplay of multiple anger dimensions, or by extension of emotional and cognitive factors, in understanding CP severity.</p><p>Notably, some demographic factors were unevenly distributed across profiles (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">S3</ref>), suggesting a relationship between age and education, and anger. Participants in the LALI were older, whereas those in the HAHI profile were younger. These findings align with research indicating that older adults often demonstrate improved emotional regulation and reduced emotional reactivity compared to younger individuals, likely due to greater life experience and the development of adaptive coping strategies over time <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49</ref> . Education also varied across profiles, with LALI and MALI profiles showing the highest levels, while HAHI had the lowest, supporting the idea that higher education may foster emotional regulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50</ref> .</p><p>Note that even after accounting for these socio-demographic differences, the associations between anger profiles and pain outcomes persisted (see Table <ref type="table">5</ref>).</p><p>In terms of exploring symptom trajectories, only pain intensity and pain behavior improved overall at follow-up, while other pain measures remained stable. These findings emphasize the coexistence of stable and dynamic components in CP: while deeply ingrained factors like pain interference and functional limitations are less responsive to short-term changes, surfacelevel symptoms such as pain intensity and behavior appear more amenable to potentially spontaneous reductions. Aligning with the biopsychosocial model <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52</ref> , this complexity underscores the need for integrating immediate symptom relief strategies with deeper interventions that target the cognitive and emotional mechanisms sustaining CP. That said, it's worth noting that these reductions were of very small effect-sizes.</p><p>Current findings offer clinically actionable insights by identifying distinct anger profiles that map onto meaningful differences in pain and disability. Higher injustice profiles (MAMI and HAHI) consistently showed the worst outcomes, positioning perceived injustice as a criticalbut complex -treatment target. Yet, unlike anger <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref> , perceived injustice is notoriously resistant to change in standard multidisciplinary pain interventions, often showing the least improvement among psychosocial risk factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">57,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">58</ref> . This likely reflects perceived injustice's deep roots in appraisals of blame, unfairness, and irreparable loss, which are difficult to directly challenge without risking invalidation. However, one evidence-supported path forward is to prioritize the formation of a strong therapeutic alliance <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">59</ref> . Early empathic engagement and humanized care have been shown to reduce anger, mitigate perceived injustice, and de-escalate adversarial attitudes <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">60</ref> . Results extend this by showing that disaggregating perceived injustice by co-occurring anger patterns can further guide therapeutic tailoring. For example, HAHI individuals may benefit from third-wave cognitive behavioral therapy, modules targeting forgiveness, meaning reconstruction, and emotion regulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">61</ref> , while avoiding direct invalidation of their beliefs related to injustice. In contrast, MALI individuals may respond more effectively to emotion awareness and expression therapy <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">62</ref> , which can help reduce maladaptive anger expression and poor affective regulation.</p><p>LALI individuals, though low in both anger and perceived injustice, were not completely immune to pain burden, as they still sought treatment; however, their notable reduction in high-impact pain over time suggests a protective role of emotional regulation, supporting maintenance-level interventions like psychoeducation or self-management <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">63</ref> .</p><p>Several limitations warrant consideration. First, despite starting with a robust sample, the reduction to about one-third at follow-up limited the statistical power for longitudinal analyses. This attrition not only reduced the ability to detect subtle effects over time but may also have introduced bias related to those lost to follow-up <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42</ref> . Second, although LPA was used innovatively to identify clinically meaningful anger subtypes in chronic pain and the stability of pain outcomes across profiles were examined over time, the limited sample size at followup prevented from conducting latent transition analysis (LTA), which generally requires larger samples (e.g., N &gt; 500) <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">64</ref> . The absence of LTA restricted insights into the potential fluidity or evolution of anger profiles over time. Future studies with even larger samples could incorporate LTA to better understand profile shifts and their implications for long-term pain trajectories. Third, while this study represents a significant step toward capturing the multidimensional nature of anger, it is not exhaustive. Future research should incorporate additional dimensions and assessments, both questionnaire-based <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> and experimental <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">65,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">66</ref> , to provide an even more comprehensive understanding of anger. Finally, the generalizability of these findings is constrained by the sample, which was drawn from patients seeking care at tertiary pain clinics within a single region (the San Francisco Bay Area). This may exclude individuals with differential pain levels or those from different socioeconomic backgrounds who are not seeking, or do not have access to, specialized medical treatment, highlighting the need for replication in more diverse and representative populations.</p></div>

Rather than eliminating anger, interventions should focus on harnessing its adaptive potential while mitigating its maladaptive processes. Achieving this balance requires a deeper understanding of how anger operates in CP, whilst considering its unique multidimensional complexity, incorporating cognitive, affective, motivational, physiological and social processes, and how these shape CP-trajectories. </p></div>

Perceived injustice emerged as a central factor distinguishing individuals with worse pain outcomes from those with more favorable trajectories. By characterizing these nuanced emotional patterns, this research highlights the crucial and complex role of anger in CP, contributing to the potential development of more refined, emotion-focused treatment approaches. Clinically, early identification and targeted management of high-anger patients may improve pain outcomes and reduce disability over time.
