<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This study reconsiders a classic sociological question: how does space shape intimate ties? Specifically, it examines how the spatial segregation of ethnic groups contributes to patterns of ethnic endogamy. It does so by applying conditional logit models to Swedish population registers describing couples who began cohabiting between 1990 and 2017. The models compare observed unions to counterfactual unions drawn from available singles, distinguishing the e!ects of ancestry assortativity-based on country of origin-from residential propinquity, while controlling for matching on nativity, education, and age. Proximity strongly predicts partnering, but assortativity matters too, particularly for non-Western groups. Mediation analysis shows that failing to account for propinquity overstates endogamy by 20-40 percent for these groups, with stronger mediation for the most segregated groups. The findings suggest that segregation complements ethnic boundaries in the short term, but also suggest how integration may undermine group boundaries in the longer term.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Patterns of endogamy and residential segregation serve as dual signals of boundaries between racial and ethnic groups (Kalm"n 1998; <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Kim and White 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b115">White et al. 2005)</ref>. Across times and places, and for socially salient racial and ethnic boundaries, people are more likely to form marital and cohabiting relationships within racial and ethnic boundaries and are more likely to reside in neighborhoods where their own group has greater representation. Classic sociological theories have posited a close link between assortative mating and segregation, emphasizing how the geographic distribution of groups shapes mating opportunities <ref type="bibr">(Blau 1977a</ref><ref type="bibr">(Blau , 1977b;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Blau et al. 1982)</ref>. Indeed, marriages in early 20th century cities were often contracted between people living within walking distance <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Abrams 1943;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Bossard 1932;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Clarke 1952;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Davie and Reeves 1939;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Marches and Turbeville 1953)</ref>. But while the e!ect of neighborhood-to-neighborhood variations in segregation patterns received considerable attention in the mid-20th century <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Kennedy 1943;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Koller 1948;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Morgan 1981;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Peach 1974;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Ramsøy 1966;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Schnepp and Roberts 1952)</ref>, contemporary analyses of assortative mating typically focus on "macro" segregation across larger sub-national geographies, e.g., provinces and counties <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Eckhard and Stauder 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Harris and Ono 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr"></ref> Kalm"n and Van Tubergen 2010; <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Lichter et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Lievens 1998</ref>). However, there has been a resurgence of interest in the role of smaller-scale geographies in patterns of racial and ethnic assortative mating <ref type="bibr">(Choi and Tienda 2017b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Feng et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Jarvis et al. 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Kalm"n and Flap 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Logan and Shin 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Mood and Jonsson 2025)</ref>. The study presented in this paper contributes to this renewed line of research, examining how spatial distances between groups with cities relate to endogamy by immigrant background in Sweden.</p><p>The spatial distribution of populations, even at small geographic scales, conditions three proximate drivers of assortative mating: opportunities, preferences, and third-party influences <ref type="bibr">(Blau 1977a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Kalm"n 1998)</ref>. Or, if we use the metaphor of a partner market, geography shapes the accessible supply of partners with specific sets of traits, the demand for partners dictated by preferences, and the activities of intermediaries who facilitate meeting and matching <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">(Schwartz 2013)</ref>.</p><p>On the supply side, people typically conduct their lives in activity spaces centered around a place of residence <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Jones and Pebley 2014)</ref>. They meet others in social foci-workplaces, schools, places of worship, bars, etc.-that draw upon local catchments <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Feld 1981;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Puur et al. 2022)</ref>, increasing interactions between singles who live near each other <ref type="bibr">(Blau 1977a</ref>). On the demand side, geography matters because people often prefer partners who live nearby, not least because it simplifies the logistical challenges of dating. Finally, geography factors into intermediaries' recruitment of clientele and the choices they make on their behalf. This includes online dating platforms' explicit use of proximity in their recommendation algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">(Tinder 2022)</ref>. In short, the partner market is also a partner landscape.</p><p>In many Western contexts, this partner landscape is characterized by persistent racial and ethnic segregation <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Elbers 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Jarvis et al. 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Malmberg et al. 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Musterd 2005)</ref>. Singles live in closer proximity to those from their own racial and ethnic groups than to other singles. Because space conditions opportunities to meet and match, spatial propinquity between co-ethnics can induce endogamy even absent any explicit preferences to partner within ethnic boundaries. Our study asks how strong this propinquity e!ect is, whether propinquity can account for a portion of observed ethnic endogamy, and whether this changes our view of the relative strength of endogamy for di!erent ethnic groups.</p><p>Our study addresses these questions using discrete choice models of union formation <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Gullickson 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Haandrikman and van Wissen 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Jepsen and Jepsen 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Nielsen and Svarer 2009)</ref>. Our approach builds on existing research examining how estimates of endogamy are a!ected by the subnational and sub-regional geographic distribution of potential partners <ref type="bibr">(Choi and Tienda 2017b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Harris and Ono 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Järv et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Lievens 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Logan and Shin 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Mood and Jonsson 2025;</ref><ref type="bibr">Peach 1980)</ref>. However, unlike studies that assess the spatial availability of co-ethnic partners primarily at the macro-level, we assess availability at the micro-level based on distances to extant potential partners. Our multinomial models treat each distinct, opposite-sex single as a prospective partner. We estimate the probability of forming a union with a particular opposite sex single as a function of the similarity between the focal partner and all other potential partners, including the realized partner. This modeling approach allows us to account for (1) the joint, marginal distributions of partner characteristics; and (2) the matching between egos and prospective partners on multiple social dimensions, especially ethnicity and proximity, but also age, education, and nativity. We then assess whether and to what extent propinquity mediates endogamy using methods developed for non-linear models <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Karlson et al. 2012)</ref>.</p><p>We perform this analysis using 1990-2017 Swedish population registers. These longitudinal data allow us to identify individual immigration backgrounds, socio-economic statuses, the timing of their entry into cohabitation or marriage, and, critically, the precise residential locations of (potential) partners. Beyond furnishing detailed data, Sweden is also a compelling place to study assortative mating because it is a microcosm of the social and demographic changes a!ecting many mature, post-industrial Western democracies. In terms of family formation, Sweden has a reputation as a "family forerunner", typically experiencing changes-e.g., the rise of non-marital cohabitation-earlier than its Western peers <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Ohlsson-W"k et al. 2020)</ref>. In terms of ethnicity, Sweden's accommodation of refugees and political asylum seekers has substantially increased its diversity since the 1980s. Approximately 30% of Sweden's population now is either foreign born or has at least one foreign born parent, many with non-European backgrounds (Statistics Sweden 2023). Alongside increasing diversity, ethnic segregation has also reached levels similar to those of European peers <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Jarvis et al. 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Malmberg et al. 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Musterd 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Musterd , 2020))</ref>. We expect that whatever relationship between propinquity and endogamy we uncover will resemble what we would discover in other contexts.</p><p>To preview, we find an independent propinquity e!ect for all groups in our study, where we distinguish people not by ethnicity, but by the closely related concept of ancestry, coded based on an individual's own or their parent's country of origin. The propinquity e!ects are somewhat weaker for Non-Western immigrants and their descendants. While we find strong endogamy for non-Western groups, both before and after controlling for propinquity, we also find that models without propinquity overstate the odds of endogamy by 20-40% on average, and by more than 70% for some groups. For those of Swedish and Western ancestry, we find a di!erent pattern: endogamy is weakly positive, but appears stronger after we control for the proximity of di!erent partners. Our results imply that while segregation-i.e., the spatial distances between groups-partly mediates assortative mating for non-Western groups, Westerners are more likely to partner with out groups in part because of (limited) spatial integration. Once we account for this spatial integration, their tendency to partner with their own group becomes more evident. However, compared to the e!ects of assortativity per se, the e!ect of propinquity on endogamy rates is only modest, accounting for less than 10% of endogamy In the remainder of the paper, we review theoretical models of assortative mating and empirical evidence about the extent of ethnic endogamy, patterns of segregation, and the relationship between the two, with special attention paid to the Swedish case. We then outline our modeling framework and analytic strategy, present the results, and discuss their implications for understanding the spatial foundations of ethnic boundaries.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p>Homogamy is a recurring feature of cohabiting and marital unions. Setting aside the fact that a preponderance of unions are di!erent-sexed, for many other indicators of group membership and social statuses-including education <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Blossfeld 2009)</ref>, income <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">(Schwartz 2010</ref><ref type="bibr">), ethnicity (Kalm"n 1993</ref><ref type="bibr">), and religion (Kalm"n 1991)</ref>-unions between similar people are more likely than unions between dissimilar people. This positive assortativity is remarkably robust across times and places <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Kalm"n 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Mare 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Schwartz 2013)</ref>. Three groups of factors are often invoked to explain these patterns of homogamy: individual preferences, opportunity structures, and third-party influences <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Kalm"n 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Lichter and Qian 2019)</ref>. Empirically, third party influences are often unobserved and are analytically subsumed by preferences and opportunities. In any case, these are integrally related to geography.</p><p>While people express preferences for numerous partner attributes-among them age, social class, religion, and physical attractiveness <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">(South 1991)</ref>-our focus here is on ethnic and racial preferences. Attitude surveys provide the clearest evidence for ethnically and racially homogamous preferences. White Europeans have tended to be resistant to or lukewarm about forming unions with immigrants, particularly those from predominantly Islamic sending countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Carol 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Hu"nk et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b109">Storm et al. 2017)</ref>. To the extent that immigrants-primarily Muslim immigrants from the Middle East-have opposed intermarriage, it has been largely on religious grounds <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Carol 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Hu"nk et al. 2010)</ref>. In Sweden, Whites have expressed openness to intermarriage, but have been slightly less open to unions with non-Western groups, particularly those from Africa, the Middle East, and Eastern Europe (Osanami Törngren 2016). Behavioral evidence from online and o#ine dating studies mirrors these attitudes: people tend to initiate and reciprocate contact within their own group, and show an adherence to racial and ethnic hierarchies similar to those observed in survey data <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Feliciano and Kizer 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Fisman et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Lewis 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Potârc$ and Mills 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Across Western contexts, evidence based on observed unions largely conforms to preference data: people are more likely to form unions with partners from their own group, but also conform to an ethnic hierarchy with native Whites perched at the top <ref type="bibr">(Choi and Tienda 2017a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Kalm"n 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Kalm"n and van Tubergen 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Qian 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Qian et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Qian and Lichter 2007)</ref>. In Sweden, exogamy appears to be least likely among those of African, Middle Eastern, and Central Asian backgrounds, and this is partly explained by cultural di!erences between Sweden and these sending contexts <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Dribe and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Lundh 2009, 2011)</ref>. Exogamy is more likely among those with Western backgrounds with countries of origin that are more culturally similar to <ref type="bibr">Sweden (i.e., immigrants</ref> or descendants of immigrants from countries in the EU/EEA, North America, or Oceania). Given that our study will use the same register data used in prior Swedish studies, we formulate our expectations in two hypotheses: Hypothesis 1A: All groups will be endogamous after controlling for the opportunity structure.</p><p>Hypothesis 1B: Endogamy will be strongest for immigrant groups tracing origins to countries that are most culturally di!erent from Sweden.</p><p>However, inferring endogamous behaviors based on observed unions requires accounting for the opportunity structures that constrain union formation <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">(Qian 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Qian and Preston 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">Schoen 1981)</ref>. Opportunity structures are the social conditions that shape the likelihood of encountering partners with di!erent social attributes and backgrounds, before people can exercise choice <ref type="bibr">(Blau 1977a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Schwartz 2013)</ref>. Even strong preferences for exogamy will fail to produce intergroup unions if opportunity structures preclude encounters between partners from di!erent groups.</p><p>Relative groups sizes are key features of the opportunity structure <ref type="bibr">(Blau 1977a)</ref>. Majority and minority group members alike are more likely to encounter those from the majority purely by virtue of its numerical superiority. All else equal, this should increase rates of majority-majority endogamy and majority-minority exogamy. Minority groups, conversely, face a mathematical constraint-they have fewer co-ethnic partners available-decreasing the likelihood of endogamy.</p><p>Empirical research addresses group size imbalances in a variety of ways. This includes controlling for group sizes at the level of national or regional marriage markets directly, or using related indicators, like group specific sex ratios or measures of heterogeneity <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Blau et al. 1982;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Blau and Schwartz 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr">Choi and Tienda 2017b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Fossett and Kiecolt 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Harris and Ono 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Okamoto 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">Schoen 1981</ref>). This research consistently shows that di!erences in group sizes are key variables that predict endogamous and exogamous union formation. For minority groups, smaller relative sizes are associated with lower rates of endogamy and higher rates of exogamy.</p><p>Marriage market opportunities also depend on how people are spatially distributed within and across regions. In fact, many studies of assortative mating disaggregate analyses to the level of provinces, counties, or cities, controlling for group sizes within these (dis)aggregates in explicit recognition of the importance of local, rather than national, marriage market compositions <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Abramitzky et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Blau et al. 1982;</ref><ref type="bibr">Choi and Tienda 2017b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Harris and Ono 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b108">Stier and Shavit 1994)</ref>. This conforms to the principle of propinquity, or the tendency of people to interact more with those who are geographically closer <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">(Small and Adler 2019)</ref>. It also aligns with early studies that established a strong link between geographic proximity and partner choice <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bossard 1932;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Davie and Reeves 1939;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Ellsworth 1948;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Marches and Turbeville 1953)</ref>, a finding consistently supported across di!erent contexts and time periods <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Clegg et al. 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Coleman 1979;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Coleman and Haskey 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Ekamper et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Haandrikman et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Haandrikman et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Küchemann et al. 1974;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Peach 1974)</ref>. Even with the rise of online dating, which has purportedly loosened geographic constraints, most couples still form within relatively short distances <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Bruch and Newman 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Haandrikman 2019)</ref>, highlighting propinquity's continued importance in partner markets.</p><p>Propinquity shapes partner choices primarily because people face logistical constraints and live geographically circumscribed lives, but also because of subjective feelings of attachment and belonging. People move within activity spaces that are often centered on a place of residence, and within those activity spaces transit between social foci-including neighborhoods, schools, workplaces, restaurants, etc.-that draw on local catchments <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Feld 1981;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Jones and Pebley 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Oldenburg and Brissett 1982;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b104">Small and Adler 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b116">Whyte 1980)</ref>. People are more likely to meet when their activity spaces overlap and their social foci coincide <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Feld 1981;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Huckfeldt 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Kalm"n and Flap 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Puur et al. 2022)</ref>. At the same time, proximity reduces the logistical costs of dating and relationship maintenance, making geographically close partners more viable and preferable <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Haandrikman and van Wissen 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Lewis 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b119">Zhang et al. 2022)</ref>. Finally, proximity can reflect a sense of place identity and attachment among in-groups of "locals". This can manifest as a%nities between local singles sharing the same place identity <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Haandrikman and Hutter 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Hummon 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Lewicka 2011)</ref>. This leads us to our Hypothesis 2:</p><p>Hypothesis 2: Proximity increases the likelihood of union formation. Conversely, the further away a potential partner is, the lower the likelihood of forming a union with that partner.</p><p>Beyond its independent role in union formation, propinquity can also be expected to mediate the relationship between ethnic segregation and endogamy. The residential segregation of racial and ethnic groups is an aspect of the spatial opportunity structure that is particularly salient to patterns of intermarriage and endogamy. This segregation manifests both between (macro) and within (micro) cities <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Lichter et al. 2015)</ref>. Macro-segregation, captured by regional or metropolitan di!erences in relative group sizes, has been an enduring concern in studies of intermarriage. But studies are increasingly also adjusting for intra-regional measures of segregation <ref type="bibr">(Choi and Tienda 2017b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Logan and Shin 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Okamoto 2007)</ref>. This acknowledges that not only do di!erent racial and ethnic groups live in di!erent cities, but also they live in di!erent neighborhoods within these cities. Measures of segregation are integrally related to distance: high levels of segregation imply greater spatial distances between groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Massey and Denton 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Reardon et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b114">White 1983)</ref>. Combined with the principle of propinquity, this implies that segregation will increase intra-group exposure and reduce inter-group contact. Correspondingly, higher levels of racial or ethnic segregation are associated with lower levels of intermarriage <ref type="bibr">(Choi and Tienda 2017b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Logan and Shin 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Okamoto 2007</ref>).</p><p>However, segregation statistics are macro-level measures that o!er noisy assessments of opportunity structures at the micro-level. Even in highly segregated populations, there will be some minority individuals who are spatially integrated with the majority, and some from the majority will live in or near neighborhoods with high minority representation. This implies measurement error at the micro-level that may lead us to understate the importance of spatial propinquity vis-à-vis ethnicity or race. Controlling for relative groups sizes at the level of the neighborhood (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Feng et al. 2010</ref>) is an imperfect patch. Salient marriage market boundaries need not coincide with the boundaries of administrative neighborhoods.</p><p>An alternative is to do away with neighborhood boundaries and measures of segregation entirely, and instead to consider how each single is spatially situated relative to other singles. The spatial availability of each potential partner can be assessed directly using geographic distance. This treats distance as one explanatory variable among many shaping who partners with whom. Because singles with di!ering racial and ethnic backgrounds are segregated-and hence more spatially distant from each other-we expect proximity to mediate the relationship between ethnicity and partner choice. We formalize this in a third hypothesis:</p><p>Hypothesis 3A: For all groups, estimates of ethnic endogamy will decline when controlling for proximity to potential partners.</p><p>We expect propinquity to mediate patterns of ethnic homogamy only to the extent that groups are residentially segregated. Compared to those who are more residentially integrated, members of more segregated groups will have fewer opportunities to meet singles from out-groups. As a result, propinquity will reinforce ethnic endogamy more strongly among highly segregated groups.</p><p>In Sweden, immigrants from Africa and the Middle East, especially from Eastern Africa, are the most segregated, immigrants from Western countries (i.e., the EU/EEA, North America, and Oceania) are the least segregated, and immigrants from Asia, Latin America, and Eastern Europe fall somewhere in between <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Jarvis et al. 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Malmberg et al. 2018)</ref>. This leads us to a corollary to our third hypothesis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hypothesis 3B:</head><p>The mediation of endogamy by propinquity will be strongest for the most segregated groups.</p><p>Complementary to the mediation, it is also important to understand how propinquity contributes to ethnic endogamy at the population scale. Even if propinquity exerts strong e!ects at the micro-level, aggregate endogamy rates depend on population structure and the relative importance of matching on other traits. While propinquity and segregation may enhance endogamy, their contribution to overall rates of endogamy may be small if the endogamous "forces of attraction" per se are su%ciently large. And existing evidence suggests these forces of attraction are quite strong in Sweden <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Mood and Jonsson 2025)</ref>. This leads us to our final hypothesis:</p><p>Hypothesis 4: Propinquity increases rates of ethnic endogamy at the aggregate level, but its influence is smaller than that of assortativity per se.</p><p>To test the above hypotheses, we combine detailed register data with the methods of discrete choice modeling. The register data allow us to define bespoke opportunity structures within which we can assess the distance between potential partners and their similarities in terms of immigration backgrounds. The discrete choice models allow us to consider the relative importance of propinquity and immigrant backgrounds in driving union formation at the level of dyads. We detail these data and methods below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data</head><p>Our study uses comprehensive data from the Swedish full population registers provided by Statistics Sweden (SCB), covering 1990-2022. During this period we observe precisely where people are living, including property identifiers and positions on a 100 𝐿 → 100 𝐿 grid. We use a retrospective approach to identify the onset of cohabitation among those who eventually marry or have children together. Starting from the full population of couples that are ever observed to marry or co-reside with common children, we backtrack through residential records to identify the first year when both partners were registered as living on the same property. We say that a couple forms a union in the interval [𝑀, 𝑀 + 1] when the partners are living at di!erent properties in year 𝑀, but living on the same property in year 𝑀 + 1.</p><p>We restrict the analysis to unions that began cohabiting between 1990 and 2017. We use 1990 as the starting year because it is the earliest that we observed locations geocoded at 100 𝐿 resolution. We use 2017, rather than 2022, as the endpoint because of our retrospective approach.</p><p>Eligible couples are defined based on childbearing and marriage that can occur up to and including 2022. But many cohabitations initiated after 2017 will not have had su%cient time to progress to marriage or childbearing by 2022. And what cohabitations we can identify after 2017 are likely to be highly selected on attributes-e.g., religiosity-that predict fast or even concurrent transition into marriage or childbearing. Excluding cohabitations initiated after 2017 addresses this selective right-censoring problem.</p><p>Our approach to identifying cohabitation involves a number of omissions. We do not identify couples who never go on to marry or have common children. We also exclude marriage migrants, i.e., when one or both partners migrates to Sweden to initiate co-habitation <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Niedomysl et al. 2010)</ref>.</p><p>We also exclude unions when partners lived in di!erent counties (Län) at time 𝑀, since our analysis targets intra-metropolitan union formation-i.e., between people already living in the same county, covering 80% of new unions. Sensitivity analyses indicate that the omission of between-county unions does not substantially a!ect our results. Lastly, we exclude same-sex unions because of their relative rarity and the di%culty in defining the relevant partner market. This leaves us with 1, 030, 231 unions formed in <ref type="bibr">Sweden between 1990 and</ref><ref type="bibr">2017.</ref> We prepare our data and define the outcome for statistical modeling by constructing two dyadic, person-year-alternative data sets, one from the perspective of women initiating cohabiting relationships, and one from the perspective of the men who they partner with, following <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Gullickson (2021)</ref>. Each woman (man) contributes an observation corresponding to the year, 𝑀, immediately preceding the onset of cohabitation at 𝑀 + 1. This assumes that the start of cohabitation aligns with the conditions of the partner market at the time of their meeting. Within each person-year, we then add rows representing di!erent alternative or counterfactual partners. We define potential, alternative partners in a way complementary to how we identify cohabitation. Potential partners must be (1) of a di!erent sex, (2) living in the same Swedish county at 𝑀, and (3) single (i.e., not living on the same property as any person they ever marry or cohabit with). We further exclude individuals younger than 16 years old in any given year to ensure that all potential partners are of eligible partnering age. Additionally, we exclude potential partners who are more than 20 years younger or older than the focal woman (or man), and those younger than 16. We fill out each person-year with 101 potential partners, including the chosen partner and 100 randomly sampled singles. The outcome variable is then a dummy that's coded 1 for the observed partner and 0 for all other partners.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Independent variables</head><p>Our independent variables are either alternative or dyad specific. They represent the features of potential partners and their similarities or di!erences from the focal woman or man entering into a cohabiting union in the 𝑀 to 𝑀 +1 interval. Our main independent variables relate to ethnic endogamy and propinquity, while our control variables relate to age and educational assortativity.</p><p>Our register data lack information about subjective ethnic identifications. We therefore use ancestry, derived from country-of-birth data, as a proxy for ethnicity, acknowledging that this approach imperfectly captures the social meaning of ethnic identity. In any case, we know the specific country of birth for people from large sending countries, while less common origins are aggregated by Statistics Sweden into regional categories. Anyone born in Sweden to exclusively Sweden-born parents is coded as having Swedish ancestry. Anyone with a foreign-born parent is assigned a non-Swedish ancestry. We assign ancestry based on the mother's country-of-birth if parents have di!erent foreign origins. If we lack information on parents, then we assign ancestry based on the person's own country of birth. This results in a set of 50 "micro" ancestry categories, that we also aggregate, based on geographic proximity and cultural similarity, into 16 meso-ancestries, and then six macro-ancestries.</p><p>The latter includes (1) Sweden; (2) Western/Northern/Southern Europe, North America, and Oceania; (3) Eastern Europe and the Balkans; (4) Asia; (5) Latin America and Caribbean; (6) the Middle East and Africa. To capture national, pan-national, and pan-ethnic assortativity (Okamoto and Mora 2014), we code each dyad based on whether the (potential) partner shares the same micro-or meso-ancestry as the focal ego. Shared meso-ancestry is treated exclusive of shared micro-ancestry: It is coded as one only when partners have the same meso-ancestry but not the same micro-ancestry. The full coding scheme is provided in Appendix Table A-1. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref> reports the frequencies of unions between macro-ancestry groups together with corresponding odds ratios, calculated following the approach in <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Mood and Jonsson (2025)</ref>.</p><p>To measure propinquity, we calculate straight-line distances between residences at time 𝑀 using 100 𝐿 → 100 𝐿 coordinates from the geographic registers. We transform distances using a natural logarithm, reflecting our expectations that relative rather than absolute di!erences in distance will be most relevant to partnership choices. Non-parametric approaches suggest that the logtransformation provides a reasonable and parsimonious fit (Appendix Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">D-2</ref>).</p><p>We also include several dyadic controls. Because ancestry is often based on parental place of birth, we can distinguish ancestry from nativity. We therefore include (1) a dummy for whether the potential partner is foreign-born and (2) a dummy for whether both partners are foreign-born, capturing higher rates of union formation among and between first-generation immigrants. We also control for partner similarity in terms of age and education at time 𝑀. Age di!erences are coded into four categories (man younger; man 0-2 years older; 3-6 years older; 7+ years older), with 3-6 years as reference. Educational homogamy is classified into three categories based on whether (1) both partners have some tertiary education (regardless of degree completion), (2) neither partner has any tertiary education, and (3) partners di!er in their educational attainment (the reference).</p><p>Missing values account for less than 1% of observations for most variables. These cases are removed from the analysis. For variables with higher rates of missingness, such as education, we include a separate category to preserve cases and maintain comparability across models.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref> presents descriptive statistics for both the sampled counterfactual couples and the actual realized couples. Compared to counterfactual couples, partners in realized couples were living closer together at 𝑀, were more likely to have the same ancestry and nativity, were closer in age, and were more likely to have similar levels of education. So the descriptive statistics provide first-order evidence for homophily in our study population. To obtain estimates of endogmay and propinquity net of each other, and net of controls, we turn to discrete choice models.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head><p>We use a discrete choice, conditional logistic modeling framework to assess the relationship between propinquity, ancestry assortativity, and union formation at the micro-level. This approach is increasingly used in studies of mate choice <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Gullickson 2021</ref><ref type="bibr">(Gullickson , 2022;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Haandrikman and van Wissen 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Qian and Lichter 2018)</ref>. A key strength of the framework is the ability to account for variations of realized and potential partners in multiple dimensions. The models represent the structure of opportunities because only actually existing singles are considered as possible partners, reflecting the empirically observed, joint distributions of attributes among available partners. Conditional on this opportunity structure, the models also allow for assortativity in multiple dimensions.</p><p>This feature allows us to flexibly model assortativity by ancestry and residential proximity, while simultaneously controlling for other sources of assortativity, like age and education. The models can also be repurposed to assess the relationship between segregation and endogamy at the macro-level, which we explore later on in this section.</p><p>The conditional logit model predicts the probability of choosing a specific, observed partner over a set of counterfactual potential partners. Specifically, our model stipulates a set of decisionmakers, indexed by 𝑁, who are conceptualized as opting into a union. Each decision-maker faces a choice set of alternative partners, 𝑂 𝑁𝑀 , and forms a union with potential partner, 𝑃, with probability:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">𝑄 𝑁 𝑃𝑀 = 𝑅 𝑆 𝐿 𝑇 𝐿 𝑀𝑁 𝑈 ↑𝑂 𝐿𝑁 𝑅 𝑆 𝐿 𝑇 𝐿𝑂𝑁</formula><p>where 𝑇 𝑁 𝑃𝑀 is a vector representing attributes of potential partners and how they compare to the focal decision-maker. 𝑆 𝑁 is then a vector of coe%cients indicating the relative importance of the corresponding attributes for union formation, which could, in principle, di!er between decisionmakers. A convenient property of the conditional logit model is that coe%cients obtained from models estimated using samples of alternative partners are unbiased and asymptotically consistent To assess the extent to which residential propinquity mediates ethnic endogamy, we estimate nested conditional logit models with and without a distance term. Because coe%cients in nonlinear models are not directly comparable across nested specifications, we use the KHB method <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Karlson et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Kohler et al. 2011</ref>) to assess mediation. This allows us to distinguish changes in the endogamy parameters that result from (1) including propinquity as a mediator from (2) decreases in the variance of error terms that result from adding more explanatory variables to a model (i.e., changes in scaling factors, see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Mood 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b118">, Williams and Jorgensen 2023</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b117">and Williams 2009)</ref>.</p><p>We also compare these micro-level mediation e!ects to segregation at the macro-level. If segregation between groups is captured by spatial proximity terms in our micro-models, then the spatial mediation e!ects we have found should be strongest for the most segregated groups and weakest for the least segregated groups. above 0.6 considered high. We plot our 50 mediation estimates against these segregation measures and asses the strength of the relationship using a bivariate linear regression.</p><p>In a final post-estimation analysis, we use the model results to test how propinquity shapes observed rates of endogamy. The KHB method identifies the mediated odds of endogamy, but not how endogamy changes at the population level when propinquity is absent-that is, if distances between potential partners were irrelevant to union formation. To do this, we use our conditional logit models to predict new unions and then calculate the share of endogamous unions (i.e., the endogamy rate) for each macro-ancestry group. We do so under four scenarios: (1) a base scenario with assortativity by age, education, and nativity, but with propinquity and endogamy coe%cients set to zero; (2) a scenario that adds endogamy e!ects, but sets the propinquity coe%cients to zero;</p><p>(3) a scenario that adds the propinquity e!ects, but sets the endogamy coe%cients to zero; and</p><p>(4) a scenario with both distance and endogamy coe%cients included as estimated. Comparing endogamy rates across these scenarios allows as to assess the degree to which propinquity vs.</p><p>ancestry assortativity per se contributes to endogamy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Before turning to the statistical models, we describe the spatial availability of partners and the potential for mediation for select ancestry groups, drawing on a subset of our data from Stockholm County, 2010-2015. Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> shows cumulative distance distributions for realized partners, sameancestry singles, and Swedes (non-Swedes for Swedish women). Separate panels are shown by women's ancestry, focusing on a set of major sending groups that illustrate variation across macro groups. Across all groups, realized partners lived closer than other available singles: median distances were typically 6-8 km, compared to 15 km for Swedish partners. Two groups stand out: Somali women, whose unions formed at exceptionally short distances (↓ 2.5 𝑈𝐿), and Thai women, whose realized distances were somewhat longer (↓ 10 𝑈𝐿). The figure also suggests that propinquity can contribute to endogamy. For many groups (e.g., Somali, Syrian, Iranian), same-ancestry singles were more proximate than Swedes, while for others (e.g., Finns, Germans) same-ancestry singles and Swedes lived at similar distances. Where people sharing the same ancestry are especially close, we expect that propinquity will be most likely to contribute to endogamy. But while these descriptive results are suggestive of a relationship between propinquity and ethnic endogamy, they ignore other drivers of assortativity, such as age and education. Our conditional logit models address this.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conditional Logit Models and Mediation Analysis</head><p>Our conditional logit models give us estimates of propinquity e!ects, ancestry assortativity, and the mediation of the latter by the former, estimated separately for di!erent macro-ancestry groups and controlling for sorting by age, education, and nativity. In the remainder of this section, we focus on ancestry and propinquity estimates. Full regression results are presented in Appendix Table B-1.</p><p>We begin with the untransformed propinquity coe%cients for each macro-ancestry group, displayed in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref>. Across all ethnic groups, there is a negative association between residential distance and the likelihood of forming a union. The coe%cients for the natural logarithm of distance before cohabitation range from ↔0.8 to ↔0.6, meaning that women were less likely to partner with more distant singles. Propinquity matters for all ancestry groups, but is most important for those with Swedish and Western European ancestry and least important for those with African and Middle</p><p>Eastern ancestry, with the other groups falling in between. Unified models with interactions between the ego's ancestry and propinquity allow statistical tests of di!erences between groups (Appendix table D-1). For women, there are significant di!erences in propinquity between Western versus non-Western groups, as well as Africa and the Middle East versus all other groups. For men, significant di!erences emerge between Western groups, Eastern European groups, and all others.</p><p>Substantively, our models suggest that a woman with Swedish or Western European background had a 1.73 times larger probability of forming a union with a more proximate partner than with an otherwise equivalent partner living twice as far away (exp (𝑆 • (ln(𝑉) ↔ ln(2𝑉))) = exp(↔0.79 • ln(2)) ↗ 1.73). African and Middle Eastern women were over 1.5 times more likely to form a union with a nearby partner compared to an otherwise equivalent partner living twice as far away. Women with Eastern European, Asian, and Latin American backgrounds had 1.6 times higher probabilities of partnering with a nearby single compared to one living twice as far away. While these di!erence between groups are non-trivial, it should be emphasized that all groups are substantially more likely to partner with those living nearby. This confirms Hypothesis 2.</p><p>Our models also provide evidence of assortativity by ancestry. Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> Panel A presents the odds of endogamy for women, stratified by macro-ancestry, comparing models with and without controlling for propinquity. That is, the point estimates represent the odds (i.e., proportional di!erences in probability) that women partnered with someone sharing the same micro-ancestry relative to an otherwise equivalent partner sharing neither the woman's micro-nor meso-ancestry.</p><p>Odds from the baseline model (without propinquity) are adjusted using the KHB method to account for scaling <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Karlson et al. 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Prior to controlling for propinquity, our models suggest that women of African and Middle</p><p>Eastern ancestry were most likely to be endogamous. They had over a 70 times greater probability of partnering with someone from the same micro-ancestry group compared to an otherwise equivalent single from a di!erent ancestry group. They are followed by women with Asian, Latin American, and then Eastern European ancestry who were, respectively, nearly 70, over 25, and over 20 times more likely to partner endogamously. The endogamy e!ects are weakest for those with Swedish and Western European backgrounds. They had 1.5 and nearly 3 times higher probabilities of partnering with someone with the same micro-ancestry, respectively. This provides support for Hypothesis 1A. We also find support for Hypothesis 1B: Those born in or born to immigrants from countries that are most culturally di!erent from Sweden (i.e., African and Middle Eastern countries) had the highest endogamy rates, while those with ancestry in from contexts that are culturally similar to Sweden (i.e., Western Europe), had the lowest endogamy rates.</p><p>Once we control for propinquity, our endogamy estimates decline substantially for all non-Western groups, but increase slightly for those with Western European and Swedish ancestry. In other words, without accounting for spatial segregation, we appear to overestimate endogamy for non-Western groups, but underestimate endogamy for the Swedish and Western European groups.</p><p>For example, in Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> Panel A, controlling for propinquity reduces the endogamy odds for women with African and Middle Eastern backgrounds from over 70 to just above 50. But for women with Swedish ancestry, endogamy odds increase-from 1.5 to 1.8 times more likely to partner with another person with Swedish ancestry-after accounting for propinquity.</p><p>Panel B of Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> quantifies and o!ers statistical tests for the extent of mediation. For all non-Western groups, endogamy is significantly overstated when not controlling for propinquity. In the African and Middle Eastern ancestry group, the endogamy e!ect is 41% larger in the model without a propinquity term. The figures are 31%, 30%, and 18% for the Asian, Latin American, and Eastern European groups, respectively. Conversely, for those of Western and Swedish ancestry, we observe significant e!ect suppression. The endogamy e!ects are 5% and 18% smaller, respectively, when we fail to account for propinquity. The results o!er qualified support for Hypothesis 3A:</p><p>Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa. For Swedes, the endogamy rate even decreases slightly (↔0.4%) with propinquity, suggesting that neighborhood-level mixing between Swedish singles and those with immigrant backgrounds masks in-group tendencies. Relative to di!erences between the base and full model scenarios, propinquity accounts for only between 4 and 14% of endogamy rates. In relative terms, propinquity explains a larger fraction of endogamy in the Western European group (13.8%), followed by the Eastern European (7.3%) and Middle East and Africa group (6.6%). Overall, the results support Hypothesis 4: propinquity contributes modestly to aggregate endogamy, but its influence is small compared to ancestry assortativity per se.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>This study revisits a timeless sociological question: how space shapes the formation of intimate ties. In doing so, we recover a thread in the sociology literature linking propinquity, segregation, and assortative mating <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bossard 1932;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Burgess and Wallin 1943;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Catton and Smircich 1964;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Clarke 1952;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Davie and Reeves 1939;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Kennedy 1943;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Koller 1948;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Marches and Turbeville 1953;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Peach 1974;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Ramsøy 1966;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Schnepp and Roberts 1952)</ref>. Nearly a century after the first systematic studies of residential propinquity, our analysis demonstrates that both social boundaries and geographic distances matter for union formation. Using Sweden as a case, we find that individuals in all ancestry groups are more likely to partner within their ancestry groups and with those who live nearby. Crucially, we show that residential propinquity accounts for a substantial share of the odds of endogamy, particularly among the most segregated groups. For aggregated non-Western groups, failing to consider propinquity leads us to overstate the odds of endogamy by 20-40 percent. For detailed groups, the overstatement of endogamy can be as high as 75 percent. In contrast, for Swedish-and Western-origin groups, ignoring propinquity masks some of the relatively modest tendency toward in-group partnering. In <ref type="bibr">Blau's (1977a)</ref> terms, propinquity specifies a micro-structural mechanism through which macro-structural segregation shapes opportunities for interaction. Physical distance remains a key conduit between social structure and social relations.</p><p>The strength and ubiquity of the propinquity e!ect underline this point. Across all ancestry groups, individuals were far more likely to partner with someone living nearby than with an otherwise equivalent person living farther away. Before cohabitation, the median distance between actual partners was less than 6 kilometers, compared to more than 33 kilometers among randomly paired singles. This stark contrast shows that the geography is not a statistical footnote but a defining feature of how relationships form. The conditional logit models confirm that this pattern persists even when we control for education, age, nativity, and ancestry. In other words, propinquity exerts its own force, belying claims that technological development has led to a "death of distance" <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Cairncross 1997)</ref>. Moreover, the log-distance functional form performs well in capturing the relationship between proximity and union formation. This indicates that relative distance matters.</p><p>The di!erence between a potential partner who is 1 km away and one who is 2 km away is comparable to the di!erence between potential partners who are 10 km versus 20 km away. The fact that the functional form holds so well strengthens the conclusion that fine-grained geographies-i.e., shortdistance variations from block to block or district to district-structure opportunities for meeting and partnering, consistent with other findings on propinquity <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">(Small and Adler 2019)</ref> as well as research on social ties in schools <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Mouw and Entwisle 2006)</ref>.</p><p>On the endogamy front, we observe a gradient that largely confirms prior research. Individuals of non-Western origin, particularly those with African, Middle Eastern, and Asian ancestry, are most likely to form in-group unions even when controlling for education, age, nativity, and propinquity.</p><p>Those of Western ancestry, by comparison, show only modest in-group tendencies, though they too are more likely to partner within their own ancestry than outside of it. And while accounting for propinquity reduces our estimates of endogamy for non-Western groups, it does not a!ect the relative standing of groups with respect to endogamy. For women, the African and Middle Eastern groups have the highest endogamy odds, and the Western groups the lowest, both before and after controlling for propinquity; among men, the Asian group shows the highest endogamy before and after controlling for propinquity. These patterns echo earlier findings from Sweden <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Dribe and Lundh 2011)</ref> and other Western contexts (Kalm"n and van Tubergen 2006), suggesting that cultural homophily and/or discriminatory constraints continue to sustain ethnic boundaries. While important for understanding the social landscape of union formation, this gradient is less surprising;</p><p>what our results add is evidence that propinquity systematically mediates these di!erences.</p><p>Our mediation analysis reveals that propinquity explains a larger share of endogamy among the more segregated groups. This aligns with our Hypothesis 3B: assuming propinquity causally a!ects partnering-whether through increased chances of meeting or through attraction to those living nearby-residentially clustered ethnic groups will form disproportionately more endogamous unions due to the higher share of co-ethnics in residential proximity. In practical terms, this means that spatial segregation augments in-group partnering: even if individuals had no preferences for co-ethnic partners, their local environments would still yield more co-ethnic unions than preferences alone would predict. Conversely, for the least segregated groups, we observe a suppression e!ect:</p><p>once we control for propinquity, the endogamy coe%cients, while weak, become slightly stronger.</p><p>This suggests a misalignment between preferences for co-ethnic neighbors and co-ethnic partners that di!ers between the most segregated and the least segregated groups. The least segregated groups-i.e., those with Western immigrant backgrounds-may be more tolerant of out-groups as neighbors than as romantic partners. This would lead to a degree of residential integration that results in a local surfeit of desired co-ethnic partners. In essence, distance must be surmounted to find a suitable partner, and our estimates of endogamy increase when we control for proximate partners. The opposite may be the case for the most segregated groups. They may find themselves in neighborhoods where co-ethnic potential partners are locally over-represented even compared to strong endogamous preferences. In this case, propinquity will drive higher rates of endogamy beyond what is preferred, yielding the mediation e!ects we find.</p><p>However, our results also highlight the continuing importance of social boundaries for rates of endogamy at the macro-level, even as propinquity shapes the odds of endogamy at the microlevel. After controlling for propinquity, the odds of endogamy remain quite high for most groups.</p><p>Because of this, propinquity accounts for only a fraction of endogamy when translated into predicted endogamy rates at the population level. The African and Middle Eastern, which is the most segregated and has the highest odds of endogamy, presents an instructive example: Propinquity contributes about three percentage points to overall endogamy rates, compared to roughly forty from ancestry assortativity. This accords with other, recent research in Sweden <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Mood and Jonsson 2025)</ref>. The contrast between large micro-level mediation and small macro-level change suggests that propinquity complements rather than drives endogamy. Spatial integration would not be a silver bullet for surmounting social boundaries around ancestry groups, at least in Sweden. But in other contexts with larger-scale patterns of segregation-as it the case with Black-White segregation in some US cities <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Lee et al. 2008</ref>)-we might expect propinquity to have a stronger impact on endogamy rates. In other words, the aggregate e!ects of propinquity on endogamy will depend on underlying segregation patterns, which are small-scale in Sweden but larger-scale elsewhere.</p><p>Our results also revealed an unexpected gradient of the propinquity e!ect across ancestry groups. While all groups were more likely to form unions with nearby partners than more distant partners, individuals of Western ancestry were most likely to partner with someone living nearby.</p><p>The propinquity e!ects were weaker for non-Western groups, and were weakest among those with African or Middle Eastern ancestry. These di!erences have several di!erent interpretations.</p><p>One possibility is that groups vary in their willingness or capacity to bridge distance. Westernorigin individuals may exhibit stronger local attachment or a preference for geographically convenient partners <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Haandrikman and Hutter 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Lewicka 2011)</ref>, whereas non-Western groups may extend their search radius to find partners who share language, religion, or cultural background.</p><p>Di!erences may also reflect how social life is spatially organized. If Western groups' activity spaces and social foci are concentrated close to home <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Feld 1981;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Jones and Pebley 2014)</ref>, local encounters will translate more directly into unions. Non-Western groups, by contrast, may have more scattered social foci and far-flung networks-religious communities, cultural associations, or transnational ties-that loosen the link between residence and meeting opportunities <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Järv et al. 2015)</ref>. Exploring such variation in activity spaces represents a promising direction for future research.</p><p>Alternatively, variation in propinquity e!ects may reflect unequal constraints on the partner market. For non-stigmatized groups, a strong distance e!ect could stem from a local abundance of willing partners. Stigmatized groups, facing higher rejection or limited choice nearby, may have to search further afield, forming unions over greater distances. In this sense, weaker propinquity among African and Middle Eastern groups likely signals barriers rather than preferences. Local abundance and social acceptance make nearby unions feasible for Western-origin groups, while for others, spatial and social constraints require extending the geography of partner search.</p><p>Although the Swedish population registers o!er exceptional coverage and precision, and our modeling framework captures partner-market constraints at an unusually fine scale, several limitations remain. First, similar to studies of neighborhood e!ects, residential location and partner choice may be jointly determined <ref type="bibr">(Choi and Tienda 2017b)</ref>. Individuals with particularly strong in-group preferences-both for partners and neighbors-may self-select into neighborhoods where co-ethnics are more abundant, creating a correlation between co-ethnic proximity and preferences for co-ethnic partners that reflects selection rather than mediation. This would bias our propinquity and mediation estimates upward. But triangulating our findings with existing literature leads us to doubt that selection alone explains our results. Swedes have a stronger position in the housing market than immigrants and are most likely to translate preferences into residential attainments <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">(Weber and Vogiazides 2023)</ref>. But rather than finding a mediation e!ect for Swedes, we find a suppression e!ect. This is consistent with empirical research on intra-ethnic relations, which suggests that people tolerate the prospect of out-group neighbors more than out-group romantic partners <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">(Weinfurt and Moghaddam 2001)</ref>. If immigrants were to take the same view, with out-groups tolerated more as neighbors than as romantic partners, and were able to enact their preferences just as well as Swedes, this would imply a similar suppression e!ect. But that is not what we find. Of course it is possible that immigrants in Sweden prefer in-group neighbors more than they prefer in-group neighbors, but this seems unlikely. But setting aside this line of argument, there may yet be technical solutions to the selection problem. Estimating a joint, mixed e!ects residential choice and assortative mating model, using longitudinal data describing both prior residential choices and the partner choice, could help (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Ben-Akiva et al. 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Brownstone et al. 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Pinjari et al. 2008)</ref>. Developing this technical solution is outside the scope of the present paper, and we leave it as a topic for future research.</p><p>Second, our analysis focuses on realized unions but does not account for individuals who remain single when faced with limited access to co-ethnic or otherwise preferred partners. If some individuals choose non-partnership over exogamy in constrained local markets, we may underestimate the influence of opportunity structures and propinquity on both endogamy and overall marriage rates. In other words, the observed mediation by propinquity likely captures only the behavior of those who do partner, not the deterrent e!ects of segregation on union formation itself. Moreover, our data exclude cohabiting couples who never go on to have common children, which likely omits a segment of relationships that are shorter, less formalized, or more likely to be ethnically mixed. To the extent that such couples di!er systematically in their residential proximity or partner choices, this omission could bias our results toward higher observed endogamy and stronger propinquity e!ects.</p><p>Third, our analysis defines the partner market as those who are single the year before cohabitation. But relationships often develop over longer periods. Partners may have met earlier or moved closer before moving in together, which could inflate the estimated propinquity e!ect. Future research should take a longer-term perspective to capture how proximity evolves before partnership formation, o!ering insights into when and with whom individuals are most likely to interact.</p><p>Finally, we exclude couples in which one partner immigrated the preceding year to focus on unions likely formed within Sweden. This removes marriage migrants, which by construction will inflate estimates of endogamy among Swedes and understate endogamy for immigrants already residing in Sweden. It also ignores the possibility that segregation, or even integration, may push some into the international marriage market. Future research could examine how transnational unions and marriage migration reflect preferences and constraints in the extended partner market <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Elwert 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Niedomysl et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Östh et al. 2009)</ref>.</p><p>While these limitations should encourage cautious interpretation and serve as fodder for future research, we believe they do not diminish our findings and our underlying message: Partner markets are also partner landscapes. The distribution of people across space structures the encounters in which social and ethnic boundaries play out. In revisiting the role of residential proximity, this study extends a long line of sociological work that has treated propinquity as a central mechanism linking spatial structure to social interaction <ref type="bibr">(Blau 1977b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Bossard 1932;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Kennedy 1943;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Morgan 1981)</ref>. In this sense, our analysis constitutes a contemporary reassessment of classic questions about how space shapes intimacy and social integration, coming after dramatic social and technological transformations of dating and the marriage market over the last few decades.</p><p>More broadly, our results suggest how racial and ethnic boundaries themselves are complicated by the demographic processes of residential mobility and union formation. People who cross an ethnic boundary when moving into a neighborhood or forming a union violate the boundary in the short term, but also create an ongoing challenge to it. Inter-ethnic couples' can a!ect patterns of segregation across neighborhoods and ties between each partner's network alters over the long term <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Ellis et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Jarvis et al. 2023)</ref>.

Because of these endogeneities, small, short-term e!ects of propinquity could accumulate into large e!ects over the long term. While our data give us no special insights into subjective racial and ethnic identifications or long-term dynamics, we hope that our research contributes to a literature that recognizes how demographic processes can mediate relationships between the material boundaries of geographic space and the symbolic boundaries of social space. Note: "Same ancestry" and "Same regional ancestry" are mutually exclusive indicators. "Same ancestry" refers to partners sharing the same detailed (micro) ancestry, while "Same regional ancestry" refers to partners from the same broader meso-ancestry category but di!erent micro origins (e.g., both Middle Eastern, but from di!erent countries). The generation variables are not mutually exclusive: "Partner foreign-born" captures cases where the partner (alter) is first-generation, regardless of the ego's nativity, while "Both partners foreign-born" captures cases where both ego and alter are first-generation immigrants.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Post-estimation</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref> shows the association between the residential segregation of micro-ancestry groups, measured by the dissimilarity index, and the mediation of endogamy by propinquity. Mediation is expressed as the ratio of endogamy odds from models without versus with a propinquity term. The relationship is positive and approximately linear: the more segregated a group is, the greater the overestimation of endogamy when propinquity is ignored. The mediation is strongest for African and Middle Eastern groups, particularly women of Somali and Syrian ancestry, though less so among those of Iraqi origin. By contrast, significant suppression appears for groups with low segregation, such as Finnish and Norwegian women, whose dissimilarity indices fall in the 0.1-0.2 range and who are culturally close to Swedes. Taken together, the figure supports Hypothesis 3B: endogamy is overstated more for groups with higher levels of segregation.</p><p>While propinquity increases the likelihood of union formation and mediates part of the ancestry endogamy e!ect, its implications for overall endogamy rates remain unclear. To clarify the relationship between micro-level behaviors and macro-level endogamy rates, we use our model estimates to produce counterfactual predictions. Table <ref type="table">3</ref> compares predicted endogamy rates for women under four counterfactual scenarios representing di!erent combinations of including or suppressing endogamy and propinquity e!ects. Substantively similar results for men are presented in Table <ref type="table">C</ref>-2. In each scenario, we hold assortativity by age, education, and nativity fixed.</p><p>We find that, in terms of endogamy rates, propinquity matters but ancestry assortativity e!ects are stronger. For all non-Swedish groups, endogamy rates are very low in the base scenario that includes only the e!ects of assortativity by age, education, and nativity. Endogamy rates are notably higher when we include the e!ects of ancestry assortativity. In the highly endogamous Middle East and Africa group, endogamy rates are nearly 40 percentage points higher when including ancestry assortativity. In contrast, including propinquity increases the endogamy rate by only up to three percentage points.

To address this, we estimated pooled models that constrain the age and education assortativity coe%cients to be the same across groups. The results are shown in Table <ref type="table">D</ref>-1. With these coe%cients constrained to be the same for all groups, it is then possible to compare endogamy and propinquity coe%cients across groups using interactions. These results correspond to what we present in the main text.</p><p>We also could be concerned that di!erent ancestry groups have di!erent shares of first-vs.</p><p>second-generation immigrants, and our endogamy results could be partly driven by this heterogeneity within groups. To address this, we considered interactions between nativity and endogamy.</p><p>These results are presented in Table <ref type="table">D</ref>-1. We find that second-generation immigrants are less endogamous across all ancestry groups, and that the patterns we present in the main text are largely driven by first generation immigrants.</p><p>Finally, we examined whether and to what degree the log-distance specification provides a reasonable fit for the data by breaking distances into a series of dummy variables. the same square but on di!erent properties. This category may therefore include atypical residential setups--such as adjacent buildings, multi-household properties, or institutional housing--that are di!erently spaced compared to properties in di!erent squares on the grid. In essence, the distribution of inter-property distances within squares may di!er qualitatively from the interproperty distances between squares. Second, the decline in coe%cients becomes steeper beyond roughly 12 km. This break point is not far from the typical diameter of a Swedish municipality, implying that the propinquity e!ect operates di!erently within and between municipalities within counties.  For each ancestry group, the figure shows the estimated endogamy coe%cient for first-generation individuals and the corresponding interaction term for second-generation; the predicted coe%cient for the second generation equals the sum of these two terms. The sample is restricted to couples living in the same county at the beginning (t) and end (t+1) of each year. Models include controls for assortativity by age, education, nativity, and residential propinquity. Source: Authors' calculations using Swedish register data, 1991-2022.</p></div>			</div>
