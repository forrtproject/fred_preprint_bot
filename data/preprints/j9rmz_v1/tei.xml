<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Episodic memories are highly dynamic and change in non-linear ways over time. This dynamism isn't captured by existing systems consolidation theories that predict a unidirectional process where memories are first supported by the hippocampus and then the neocortex. I propose a three-dimensional state-space for episodic memories. The first two dimensions relate to whether episodic retrieval is driven by the hippocampus and the neocortex, critically allowing for independent and additive contributions from both regions. The third dimension relates to the episodic-specificity of retrieval. Memories can be located at any point in this state-space and move to any other location. The state-space captures the dynamic nature of episodic memory and broadens the search space of possible memory states and transformations across time.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The dynamic nature of episodic memory</head><p>Episodic memory, our ability to recollect previous life events, is highly dynamic and reconstructive <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Once encoded, memories change, and their expression relies on different neural mechanisms and brain regions. To explain this dynamism, multiple theories of systems consolidation (Glossary) have been proposed that capture certain aspects of this process (Box 1; <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>), such as the potential time-limited role of the hippocampus in supporting episodic memory. However, these theories fail to fully capture the dynamic and reconstructive nature of episodic memory. For example, the role of the hippocampus may not always be time-limited and may remerge as a critical structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref>, reversing the predicted hippocampal-to-neocortical transfer of regions that supports recollection. This dynamism and flexibility has recently been noted <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>, however we lack a theoretical framework for dealing with such dynamism. I propose a new 'state-space' framework to understand how episodic memories are expressed and how we can track changes to this expression over time. Critically, the proposed neural statespace for episodic memories allows for dynamic changes in memory expression over time that most theories of systems consolidation are not able to explain. I first outline current theories of episodic memory retrieval and systems consolidation before challenging some key assumptions of theories of systems consolidation, highlighting how most theories are not able to fully capture the dynamic nature of episodic memory over time. I use this critique to introduce a new framework -a neural state-space for episodic memory -that allows for the retrieval of memories to dynamically change over time. I demonstrate how existing theories sit within this state-space and outline experimental approaches that would allow for an exploration of this neural state-space.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Neocortical reinstatement underpins episodic recollection</head><p>When we experience an event, the individual elements of the event such as where we are and who we are with are represented in patterns of neural activity in distinct neocortical regions (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).

Instead, reinstatement is driven by a process where neocortical representations are 'reconstructed' via back projections along specific neocortical processing pathways <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref>. Indeed, reinstatement has been shown in both higher-order <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> and primary visual regions <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, demonstrating that reinstatement can flow back along the entire processing pathway. This process should occur along multiple processing pathways related to the elements of an event. For example, reinstatement of object and location representations might independently occur via reconstructing representations in the ventral and dorsal visual pathways <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>. Recollection is therefore underpinned by neocortical reinstatement, and this reinstatement occurs via a reconstructive process along neocortical processing pathways.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Current theories of systems consolidation</head><p>Theories of systems consolidation propose a time-limited role for the hippocampus in driving this reinstatement <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref>. When an event is first experienced, no direct connections exist between the neocortically represented event elements, and the hippocampus is needed to bind together and subsequently retrieve these elements. Over time, an active process of systems consolidation is thought to occur where connections between the independent neocortical representations form, decreasing the need for the hippocampus to drive reinstatement (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). These new connections are thought to be formed either directly between neocortical regions <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, or via a second 'hub' such as the ventromedial prefrontal cortex <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. These connections are predicted to form gradually via the 'reactivation' of hippocampal traces, potentially during offline periods <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> such as non-REM sleep <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41]</ref>.</p><p>Despite variations across different theories of systems consolidation (Box 1), there is general agreement to the predictions that (1) episodic recollection is underpinned by neocortical reinstatement, (2) neocortical reinstatement is initially driven by the hippocampus, and (3) over time the role of the hippocampus as a driver of reinstatement decreases and another nonhippocampal mechanism drives reinstatement. A final key prediction by specific theories is that over the course of systems consolidation, reinstatement becomes less episodically-specific and more 'gist-like' <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>. Critically, recent evidence suggests none of these theories are able to fully capture the dynamic nature of episodic memory.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>From hippocampal to neocortical retrieval</head><p>Given that recollection is underpinned by the reconstruction of representations along neocortical processing pathways <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37]</ref>, how do the above tenets of systems consolidation fit with this retrieval mechanism? According to systems consolidation, reinstatement can occur via two mechanisms: (1) the retrieval of a hippocampal memory trace that drives reinstatement (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>) and/or (2) a non-hippocampal mechanism (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>). Critically, reinstatement should be less hippocampally driven and more driven by a non-hippocampal mechanism over time. When experiencing an event, a distributed pattern of activity occurs along neocortical processing pathways (pathways shown here are intentionally 'generic' but could map to ventral and dorsal visual pathways as well as other sensory processing pathways (e.g., auditory)). These pathways convergence on the hippocampus and are bound into a memory trace allowing for their retrieval later in time. At encoding, all neocortical representations are active, forming a new hippocampal memory trace. At retrieval, a subset of neocortical representations will be active, allowing for the retrieval of the hippocampal memory trace and subsequent reinstatement of the remaining neocortical representations. B. Over time, connections between neocortical regions form, allowing for their retrieval without the involvement of the hippocampus. Blue lines = pre-existing connections/representations, yellow lines = newly formed connections/representations; grey lines = previously formed connections that have weakened.</p><p>However, despite this general prediction, theories are rarely explicit in relation to <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> how reinstatement occurs when both mechanisms are available to drive reinstatement and (2) how these two mechanisms are related over time.</p><p>How do the two drivers of reinstatement interact at the point of retrieval? Are they compensatory, such that if one fails to drive reinstatement the other takes over, or are they instead additive, such that the strength of reinstatement is driven by the combined contribution of both mechanisms? We have recently provided evidence for an additive relationship -both mechanisms cumulatively contribute to reinstatement. Using fMRI, we correlated neocortical reinstatement with a neural marker of hippocampal pattern completion (hippocampal activity during a memory task where complex events are retrieved in a 'holistic' manner, consistent with the presence of pattern completion; Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>). Immediately after encoding, we see a positive relationship -the greater the evidence for hippocampal pattern completion the greater the evidence for neocortical reinstatement <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43]</ref>. Importantly, when there is no evidence for hippocampal pattern completion there is no evidence for reinstatement (formally, the intercept of the correlation is zero). This suggests that immediately after encoding the hippocampus is the sole driver of reinstatement.</p><p>After 24-hours we still see a significant correlation between the hippocampus and reinstatement, suggesting that the hippocampus is still driving reinstatement, but now also see a non-zero intercept <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>. This positive intercept provides evidence for reinstatement in the absence of</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 2. Assessing hippocampal and non-hippocampal contributions to reinstatement</head><p>Correlating a marker of hippocampal pattern completion at retrieval (x-axis) with the amount of neocortical reinstatement (y-axis) provides a measure of how much reinstatement is driven by the hippocampus. A positive slope provides evidence for the hippocampus driving reinstatement. A positive intercept provides evidence for the presence of neocortical reinstatement in the absence of evidence for hippocampal pattern completion, suggesting an independent non-hippocampal mechanism is driving reinstatement. Independently assessing the slope and intercept of this relationship therefore provides a measure of the extent to which the hippocampal and non-hippocampal mechanism are driving reinstatement (Slope = hippocampal mechanism; intercept = non-hippocampal mechanism). Each panel shows a pattern of data that could be seen using the experimental approach from <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>. Example data (simulated in R) showing A. a positive slope and zero intercept (strong hippocampal, weak non-hippocampal contribution), as seen immediately after encoding in <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>, B. a positive slope and intercept (strong hippocampal, strong non-hippocampal contribution), as seen 24 hours after encoding in <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, and C. zero slope and positive intercept (weak hippocampal, strong non-hippocampal contribution), not seen in <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref> but predicted as the end-point of consolidation in most theories of systems consolidation. Critically, the proposed state-space predicts that these patterns could be seen at any timepoint after encoding given specific conditions. See <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43]</ref> for real data. I = Intercept, S = Slope in bar graphs. evidence for hippocampal pattern completion. We infer from this that another, nonhippocampal, mechanism is contributing to reinstatement after 24 hours. Critically, while we see a significant increase in the intercept over 24 hours (from 0 to &gt;0), implying an increase in a nonhippocampal mechanism, we see no evidence for a decrease in the slope of the relationship, implying there is no decrease in the hippocampal mechanism. These data suggest that the two mechanisms additively contribute to neocortical reinstatement -the hippocampus still drives reinstatement to the same degree after 24 hours, but reinstatement is now being boosted by a non-hippocampal mechanism. Further empirical studies need to assess the additive nature of reinstatement, ideally using within-subject correlations (as opposed to the across-subject correlations used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43]</ref>) that allow for the assessment of reinstatement at the level of individual episodic memories.</p><p>In relation to how the two mechanisms are related over time, Complementary Learning Systems (a computational instantiation of Standard Systems Consolidation Theory) makes the explicit prediction that the non-hippocampal mechanism increases in strength as a function of repeated interleaved reactivation during offline periods <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. There is ample evidence supporting this prediction <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>. The hippocampal mechanism in this model decreases as a consequence of passive decay over time, and recent research supports such a decay mechanism <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>, potentially driven via hippocampal neurogenesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51]</ref>. Thus, the causes of an increase in one mechanism and a decrease in the other are mechanistically distinct -reactivation vs decay.</p><p>Current empirical research suggests that the two mechanisms that drive reinstatement are independent and additively contribute to reinstatement and the increase/decrease of these mechanisms are independent. Further, if they are mechanistically distinct, then the time course with which they increase/decrease can potentially differ. They may be loosely temporally correlated, but that does not mean they are mechanistically related to one another nor follow the same precise time-course. The conclusion is that two independent mechanisms with different time-courses additively contribute to neocortical reinstatement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>From detail-rich to gist-like retrieval</head><p>A second key concept is the process of semanticisation, where episodic memories become more generalised or 'gist-like' as a function of systems consolidation. This is specifically a prediction of Trace Transformation Theory (TTT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref>. Under this theory, the hippocampus supports episodically-specific, detail-rich representations and the neocortex supports more abstract, gistlike representations.</p><p>There is evidence showing decreased specificity of the remembered event over time, particularly for the specific perceptual and/or peripheral aspects of the event <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53]</ref>. However, it is not clear whether this more rapid forgetting of event details is mechanistically linked to systems consolidation. If recollection is underpinned by the reconstruction of neocortical representations, then it is not clear why the hippocampus should drive more detail-rich reinstatement than a non-hippocampal mechanism, particularly given the hippocampus does not have direct projections to lower-level sensory regions <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>.</p><p>We can conceptualise 'episodic specificity' in two ways: in relation to <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> the perceptual specificity of reinstated neocortical representations and (2) the forgetting of certain aspects of the event and not others (i.e., the 'coherence' of memory retrieval). In the case of the former, we might reinstate all event elements, but less specifically. For example, we might forget the apple was green and not red. If perceptual specificity at retrieval is a consequence of how far back along a given processing pathway reactivation occurs, there is no clear reason that the hippocampus should drive reinstatement further back down processing pathways than a non-hippocampal mechanism. Critically, there is currently no empirical data showing that hippocampally-driven reinstatement occurs further back along a given processing pathway relative to nonhippocampally-driven reinstatement. Thus, there is no reason to expect a loss in perceptual specificity as a function of systems consolidation.</p><p>If episodic specificity is a function of forgetting certain aspects of the event and not others, such as forgetting where we found the apple but still remembering the apple was green, there is no reason to assume this should occur as a direct consequence of systems consolidation. While offline reactivation might cause certain direct neocortical connections to form at the expense of others, thereby prioritising some aspects of the event, this forgetting of specific elements could occur independently of the active process of systems consolidation (e.g., via forgetting mechanisms such as interference or decay; <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref>).</p><p>In sum, there is no reason that an active process of offline reactivation should cause a change in what is being reactivated. Two independent mechanisms could drive the reinstatement of the same pattern, which would result in the same degree of episodic-specificity at retrieval. Instead, the loss in specificity might be temporally correlated with systems consolidation but caused by forgetting. We should not assume that a loss in episodic-specificity at retrieval is mechanistically related to systems consolidation simply because it is temporally correlated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The dynamic nature of episodic memory</head><p>I have argued that three processes that often temporally co-occur are not mechanistically related, as is assumed in systems consolidation theories. Neocortical reinstatement can be driven, in an additive manner, by two independent mechanisms and the increase/decrease over time of these mechanisms are independent. Further, the specificity with which reinstatement occurs is related to mechanisms that are theoretically independent of what is driving the reinstatement. For example, a strong input from either a hippocampal or non-hippocampal mechanism could both cause a high degree of episodic specificity.</p><p>A further critical assumption in most theories of systems consolidation is that the process is unidirectional -from hippocampally-driven reinstatement to non-hippocampally-driven reinstatement over time. Agreeing with TTT, I challenge this assumption <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref>. First, the hippocampal mechanism can be maintained over longer periods of time by the application of norepinephrine to the amygdala shortly after initial encoding <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref>. Second, the non-hippocampal mechanism does not have to slowly emerge over time but can be engaged rapidly either through retrieval-based mechanisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref>, or when events are aligned with our schematic understanding of the world <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">64]</ref>. Thus, the time-course of both mechanisms can be substantially altered. More critically, the hippocampal mechanism can be increased <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref> or even re-engaged <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref> as a driver of reinstatement at longer delays, suggesting the typical direction of systems consolidation can be entirely reversed. This hippocampal re-engagement is highlighted in studies of systems reconsolidation, where a memory trace that is thought to have undergone systems consolidation, and is therefore hippocampus independent, becomes dependent on the hippocampus again following memory reactivation via a reminder cue <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref>. Thus, the extent to which the hippocampal and non-hippocampal mechanism contribute to reinstatement can differ both after initial encoding and over time in non-linear and nonunidirectional ways.</p><p>Finally, the degree to which reinstatement is episodically-specific is also likely highly dynamic. Although specific episodic detail will often be lost over time, some situations likely allow for maintained specificity at the point of retrieval. For example, you might experience an event with a specific object (e.g., your favourite coffee cup). Given you are then likely to encounter the same coffee cup repeatedly, when retrieving the first event you will be able to reinstate a high degree of perceptual specificity in relation to the cup. Conversely, if you saw lots of different coffee cups in the intervening period, the specificity of reinstatement for the cup would likely be much less detailed and more 'gist-like'. As neocortical reinstatement is a reconstructive process, 'episodicspecificity' is more likely driven by a range of factors, including long-term (personal) semantic knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">67]</ref> and experiences following the critical event, rather than what mechanism is driving reinstatement. Indeed, recent research shows that the hippocampus can drive both specific and gist-like retrieval, a process mediated by hippocampal neurogenesis after initial encoding <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">69]</ref>, underlining how the specificity of reinstatement can be independent of the mechanisms driving reinstatement. Although TTT allows for dynamic changes in episodicspecificity over time, it does not allow for this specificity to be decoupled from the mechanism driving reinstatement <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A Neural State-Space for Episodic Memories</head><p>I have argued for at least three independent processes that are often mechanistically linked in systems consolidation theories: (1) the creation and loss of a hippocampal trace that drives reinstatement, (2) the creation and loss of a non-hippocampal mechanism that drives reinstatement, and (3) the episodic-specificity of reinstatement at retrieval. I have also argued that these time-courses can differ markedly dependent on encoding conditions and subsequent experiences. To better conceptualise these processes, I propose a three-dimensional neural 'state-space', where any given episodic event can be located at any given point in this space at the point of retrieval and move to any other point within the space under specific conditions (Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>).</p><p>The first dimension of the state-space is the strength of the hippocampal trace that drives reinstatement (from weak to strong), the second dimension is the strength of the nonhippocampal mechanism that drives reinstatement (from weak to strong), and the third dimension is the degree to which reinstatement is episodically-specific (from low to high specificity). It is possible that more independent dimensions exist. For example, there may be multiple non-hippocampal mechanisms that drive reinstatement (e.g., both direct long-range neocortical connections and new neocortical 'hubs' including the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, medial parietal cortex, and angular gyrus). Further, episodic-specificity may differ in a number of ways, including (but not limited to) the perceptual specificity of reinstatement and the degree to which certain aspects of an event are remembered (the 'coherence' of episodic retrieval <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[70]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[71]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[72]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[73]</ref>). Here, I focus on these three dimensions for theoretical clarity and because of their importance in relation to theories of systems consolidation. I refer to the second dimension as a 'non-hippocampal' mechanism, as it is still an open question as to what is driving nonhippocampal reinstatement (or whether multiple non-hippocampal mechanisms exist). A similar multidimensional memory space has been proposed <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, however the specific dimensions were not formally defined and the emphasis of the framework was related to how memories change to be behaviourally relevant as opposed to the focus here on the neurocognitive mechanisms that support episodic retrieval. This state-space is not a mechanistic account of systems consolidation. However, I have outlined a model of episodic retrieval that focusses on reconstructive reinstatement, which provides a mechanistic basis for interpreting movement through this state-space. The state-space of episodic memory is a broader theoretical framework that starts with the assumptions that (1) three processes that are mechanistically linked in most systems consolidation theories are independent, and (2) memories can move from any location in this state-space to any other location (Figure <ref type="figure">3A</ref>). The advantage of this state-space framework is that it allows for the mapping of current theories of systems consolidation (Figure <ref type="figure">3B</ref>) and highlights the locations and directions of travel in the state-space that these theories do not predict (Figure <ref type="figure">3C</ref>). For example, TTT predicts that a recently encoded event will be reinstated by the hippocampus in a detail-rich manner and, following systems consolidation, will often be reinstated by a non-hippocampal mechanism in a more gist-like manner (Box 1). Critically, TTT doesn't allow memories to move to locations in the state-space such as reinstatement that is detail-rich occurring via a nonhippocampal mechanism. This mapping of current systems consolidation theories in the state-space highlights regions of the space that have not been considered. For example, strengthening of the hippocampal and non-hippocampal mechanism would result in both mechanisms additively contributing to reinstatement. It is plausible that offline reactivation, or active retrieval, strengthens both</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 3. A Neural State-Space for Episodic Memories</head><p>The state-space comprises three dimensions -the degree to which reinstatement is driven by a hippocampal mechanism (Hippocampal; weak to strong), the degree to which reinstatement is driven by a non-hippocampal mechanism (Non-hippocampal; weak to strong), and the degree to which reinstatement is episodically-specific (Specificity; low to high).

MTT starts with medium hippocampal, weak non-hippocampal, and high specificity and (as more hippocampal traces form) moves to strong hippocampal (the other two dimension remain the same; grey arrow). SCT predicts no movement in this space -the hippocampus is always required for recollection (not shown in subplot B). C. Underexplored trajectories through the state-space. Potential trajectories through state-space that are underexplored and/or not currently predicted by existing theories. The forgetting of 'consolidated' memories, from strong non-hippocampal to weak non-hippocampal (blue arrow); an increase in episodic specificity (from low to high) despite reinstatement being driven the nonhippocampal mechanism (yellow arrow); the reintroduction of the hippocampal mechanism (from weak to strong) following 'consolidation' (grey arrow). mechanisms, leading to memories moving to such a location in the state-space. Indeed, it seems unlikely that the offline reactivation of a hippocampal trace would result in the strengthening of the non-hippocampal mechanism without a similar strengthening of the hippocampal trace itself (Box 2). A further underexplored region of this space is the weakening of the non-hippocampal mechanism. While most theories assume that hippocampal traces decay over time, we do not know how long-range neocortical connections weaken. One possibility is via interference mechanisms that are thought to occur locally in neocortical regions <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">57]</ref>, but we don't know whether interference also occurs for more long-range connections.</p><p>By highlighting unexplored regions of this state-space, the idea is to test the strong assumptions of (1) independence and (2) non-unidirectional movement within the state-space. It is possible that these two assumptions don't hold. For example, there might be some areas of the statespace that memories are not able move to, or certain directions of travel that are not possible. Fully exploring the state-space would allow for the identification of planes or manifolds in this space that memories are constrained to, or attractor states that memories gravitate towards. This broader theoretical framework therefore allows for a wider range of theoretical perspectives, with the intention that fully exploring the state-space will enable the development of more accurate mechanistic models in the future.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Exploring the state-space</head><p>One critical question is how best to explore this proposed state-space. How do we test for the assumptions of independence and non-unidirectional movement? First, we need experimental and analysis approaches that can assess the degree to which reinstatement is driven by the hippocampal and non-hippocampal mechanism. Critically, we need to assess how reinstatement is driven at the point of retrieval, which standard univariate analyses that focus on hippocampal and neocortical changes in activity over time are not able to do <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[74]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[75]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[76]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[77]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[78]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[79]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[80]</ref>. Our recent approach, assessing the slope and intercept of the relationship between hippocampal pattern completion and neocortical reinstatement is able to do this <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>, as are functional connectivity measures between the hippocampus and neocortex <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[74,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">81]</ref>. Second, we need to assess the degree of 'episodic-specificity' at retrieval. This can be done behaviourally, for example by probing the degree to which participants remember perceptual vs conceptual features of elements in an event <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">82]</ref>, or more gist-like vs specific features of an event <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>. It can also be achieved using multivariate pattern analysis of neuroimaging data, assessing the specificity of reinstatement in neocortical regions <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref>. Critically, these approaches would need to be combined, and used at multiple time-points after encoding, to track their proposed independent time-courses.</p><p>The above approach would assess the independence of the three state-space dimensions, but not the extent to which movement is non-unidirectional. One direction of travel that SSCT does not currently predict is the re-emergence of the hippocampus in driving reinstatement (Figure <ref type="figure">3C</ref>). Recent advances in causally manipulating deeper brain regions, for example with transcranial focussed ultrasound stimulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">[83]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[84]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[85]</ref> or electrical temporal interference stimulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">[86]</ref>, allow for the up-and down-regulation of the hippocampus. One approach would be to assess the hippocampal contribution to reinstatement at longer delays (where the hippocampus is less likely to be contributing to reinstatement under 'normal' conditions) following upregulation of the hippocampus prior to retrieval. This potential re-emergence of a hippocampal contribution would fit with recent optogenetic research showing hippocampal engrams can be re-activated following a period of forgetting <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">[87]</ref>. A further possibility it to use reminder cues shortly before retrieval following a long delay between encoding and retrieval, promoting systems reconsolidation mechanisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</p><p>A second direction of travel that systems consolidation theories do not currently predict is that an older memory that is currently being retrieved with little episodic detail can increase in episodic-specificity (Figure <ref type="figure">3C</ref>). Here it might be possible to up-regulate specific cortical regions where reinstatement occurs to drive increased specificity, despite the reinstatement being largely driven by a non-hippocampal mechanism. Finally, it might be possible to increase episodic-specificity experimentally with increased exposure to specific event elements across novel events -similar to the example above of using the same coffee cup repeatedly across experiences. Although not exhaustive, I have outlined specific experimental, analysis, and methodological approaches that might allow us to both track and change the location of an episodic memory in this state-space in humans.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Concluding remarks</head><p>Memories dynamically change over time. To account for these changes, theories of systems consolidation predict that the reinstatement of events is first driven by the hippocampus and over time is driven by a non-hippocampal mechanism, and that during this process memories become less episodically-specific. Although all three processes are typically temporally correlated, I have argued that the present evidence suggests that they are mechanistically independent and should be assumed so until evidence to the contrary is provided. I have introduced a 3D state-space to allow, and further test, for this mechanistic independence, where a given episodic memory can be located anywhere in this state-space at any given moment in time. Further, the location of a given memory can move from any location in this state-space to any other. These assumptions of mechanistic independence and non-unidirectional movement challenge current theories of systems consolidation and broaden the search space of possible changes to memories over time. I have further outlined recent experimental, analysis, and methodological advances that allow us to search this proposed state-space, allowing for more mechanistic models of memory change to be developed. More broadly, setting out a wider theoretical space in which current mechanistic models of systems consolidation can be placed allows for better comparison between models and highlights areas of theoretical space that have received less attention or have not been envisaged (see Outstanding Questions). Critically, the state-space framework of episodic memory captures the dynamic nature of memory and provides a theoretical grounding for how this dynamism occurs.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Box 1 -Theories of Systems Consolidation</head><p>Standard Systems Consolidation Theory (SSCT) -SSCT proposes that the hippocampus rapidly encodes new episodic experiences and is critical to their retrieval <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref>. Over time there is a 'transfer' (Box 2) from the hippocampus to neocortex, such that the retrieval of events becomes less hippocampal-dependent over time. This hippocampal-to-neocortical 'transfer' is thought to occur via offline reactivation of hippocampal traces, leading to the gradual formation of nonhippocampal connections between neocortical representations.</p><p>Multiple Trace Theory (MTT) -MTT proposes that the hippocampus is always critical to the retrieval of episodic events and that each time an event is retrieved, a new hippocampal trace will be formed creating multiple similar traces of the original experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. The overlapping traces are thought to allow for the extraction of generalities over time, supporting the emergence of semantic knowledge from episodic events.</p><p>Trace Transformation Theory (TTT) -TTT builds on SSCT and MTT, proposing that the hippocampus is always critical to the retrieval of episodic events, however overtime the neocortex can support the retrieval of more 'gist-like' or semanticised memories <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref>. Thus, the 'transfer' from the hippocampus to neocortex is accompanied by a change from episodicallyspecific to more gist-like retrieval. Once both a detail-rich and a gist-like representation has been formed, TTT allows for either trace to dominate at retrieval over time.</p><p>Scene Construction Theory (SCT) -SCT proposes that the hippocampus is always needed for the construction of the episodic context or 'scene' of a previous event <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. While hippocampal traces are predicted to have a relatively short lifespan, a new hippocampal trace is re-established at longer time delays via the reconstruction of consolidated neocortical representations associated with the event. Thus, whereas the elements of an event can be 'consolidated' in the neocortex, the reconstruction of the event into a spatially coherent 'scene' requires the hippocampus regardless of delay.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Box 2 -The fallacy of hippocampal-to-neocortical transfer</head><p>The concept of systems consolidation is often associated with a 'transfer' from a hippocampal to a neocortical memory trace. Although perhaps not explicitly stated, there is often an implicit assumption that mnemonic information is transferred from the hippocampus to neocortex. However, the expression of an episodic memory is via the reconstructive reinstatement of representations in the neocortex. As such, there is no 'transfer' of mnemonic information, but instead, at most, a transfer in relation to what mechanism is driving reinstatement. The representational content is always in the neocortex, it is just reactivated via different mechanisms over time.</p><p>However, a transfer process implies that one mechanism takes over from the other -as the nonhippocampal mechanism increases the hippocampal mechanism should decrease in an equal manner. Two issues undermine this concept. First, as discussed in the main text, the decrease in hippocampal mechanism is likely driven by an independent process (decay) relative to the process that increases the non-hippocampal mechanism (offline reactivation). Second, it is unclear how the hippocampal mechanism decrease occurs in the presence of continual offline reactivation of the hippocampal trace. Why is reactivation of a hippocampal trace not reinforcing of the trace itself? The default assumption in neuroscience is that synaptic strength increases as a function of neural firing via Hebbian learning. Under this assumption, the reactivation of a hippocampal trace should strengthen itself (as well as increasing any non-hippocampal mechanism). McClelland et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> speculate that an additional mechanism might exist, for example the suppression of hippocampal synaptic plasticity during sleep <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[88]</ref> or synaptic downscaling during sleep <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">[89]</ref>, that supresses this reinforcement. However, such mechanisms would likely only prevent further strengthening and, in the case of synaptic downscaling, would not be trace specific. As such, offline reactivation could lead to the strengthening of both the hippocampal and non-hippocampal mechanism.</p><p>Given I have argued for two independent mechanisms that drive reinstatement at retrieval and that the decrease in one mechanism is not related to the increase in the other mechanism, then the notion of 'transfer' is a fallacy. There is no transfer, but simply two distinct drivers of reinstatement that increase/decrease over time via different mechanisms.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure1.
