<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Outcomes: A Monte Carlo Simulation with Conditional and Marginal Models</head><p>Single-case experimental designs (SCED) are experimental designs for assessing the treatment effect of an intervention on a small number of cases by repeatedly measuring outcomes over time under multiple conditions manipulated by the experimenter <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Kratochwill &amp; Levin, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Onghena, 2005)</ref>. These designs involve the manipulation of treatment and control conditions over time and assess causal effects by comparing outcomes observed under treatment conditions to those observed under control conditions. Because the measurement procedure in SCEDs often rely on direct observations of behaviors, count data are very common, such as number of aggressive behaviors, number of words read correctly per minute, and number of digits correct in math practices. As the distributions of count data are usually non-normal and show heteroscedasticity due to the dependent relationship between mean and variance, traditional effect sizes that assume normality and homogeneity, such as the standardized mean differences (e.g., Cohen's d type effect sizes), might not be appropriate for count data. In addition, count data typically represent the number of events occurring over a specific period of time, and an incidence rate is computed by dividing the count by the units of time. Effect sizes for count data should remain the same no matter what unit is used as the divisor to determine the incidence rate.</p><p>However, standardized mean differences are highly sensitive to the units used for the divisor <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Pustejovsky, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Wilson, 2022)</ref>. In some cases, researchers fail to report session lengths, further complicating the effect sizes calculation for count data.</p><p>To address these issues, researchers have proposed alternative effect size measures for count outcomes in SCEDs, such as the log response ratio (LRR; <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Pustejovsky, 2015</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Pustejovsky, , 2018))</ref>, the Bayesian rate ratio (BRR, Natesan <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Batley et al., 2021)</ref> and the incidence rate ratio (IRR; <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Li et al., 2025)</ref> for count data in SCEDs, all of which quantify the magnitude of treatment effects as a proportional change between baseline and treatment phases within cases. Unlike the LRR and BRR, the IRR can simultaneously account for baseline trend, trend change, overdispersion, zeroinflation, and measurement dependencies due to autocorrelation and nested data structure at the same time through the flexible framework of generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs, <ref type="bibr">Li et al., 2025;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Li et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Li, 2024)</ref>.</p><p>Traditionally, the IRR and its variants, such as relative rate ratio and log response ratio, have been widely adopted and discussed in meta-analyses and research synthesis methods across disciplines such as medicine, epidemiology, and evolutionary biology (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Hawken et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Lane, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Li et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Spittal et al., 2015)</ref>. In the behavior and social sciences, methodologists have introduced modeling approaches including generalized liner models (GLMs) and GLMMs to analyze count data, highlighting differences in the interpretation of proportional effect sizes like the IRR in GLMs/GLMMs versus additive effect sizes from linear (mixed) models <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Aiken et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Atkins et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Coxe et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Grimm &amp; Stegmann, 2019)</ref>. In the SCED context, <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Li et al. (2024)</ref> found that GLMMs can yield accurate estimates and reliable inferential statistics for treatment effects quantified by the IRR in multiple baseline designs (MBDs) when researchers make sounded statistical decisions regarding model selections.</p><p>Despite the wide use of IRR as a standard effect size measure for count outcomes in many fields and its favorable statistical properties in SCEDs, the IRR derived from SCEDs is a within-case IRR (WC-IRR), reflecting within-case contrasts. As a result, it is not appropriate to combine WC-IRR in research synthesis with the IRRs obtained from between-group designs, such as randomized control trials (RCTs). To address this issue, researchers have developed a between-case IRR (BC-IRR) for AB designs and MBDs <ref type="bibr">(Luo et al., 2025)</ref>. As a marginal effect size, BC-IRR is equivalent to the IRR that would be obtained in a potential RCT when certain assumptions are met. Specifically, it is assumed that a never-treated group exists that is comparable to the treated units in a SCED in terms of individual effects, and that the model for the potential outcome under the control condition is correctly specified. Therefore, BC-IRR is a design-comparable effect size that can be used in research synthesis of SCEDs and RCTs.</p><p>The previous study <ref type="bibr">(Luo et al., 2025)</ref> demonstrated the equivalence of BC-IRR and IRR based on a potential RCT using a structural model and simulations of a pseudo-population.</p><p>However, the study did not investigate the statistical properties of the BC-IRR estimator in the SCED context. Moreover, it considered only one approach to estimate BC-IRR through conditional model of GLMMs, where the calculation of BC-IRR is quite complex, involving conditional estimates of immediate effect and trend change, as well as associated variance and covariance components. In this study, we consider an alternative approach to estimate BC-IRR through marginal models. By definition, BC-IRR is a marginal effect, that is, a ratio of the average outcome level at a certain session in the treatment phase across cases to the counterfactual (i.e., if the intervention is not introduced) average outcome level at the same session <ref type="bibr">(Luo et al., 2025)</ref>. Hence, marginal models such as generalized estimating equations (GEEs) are well-suited <ref type="bibr">(Liang &amp; Zeger, 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr">Zeger &amp; Liang, 1986)</ref> and it is worthwhile exploring GEE as an alternative to GLMMs for estimating BC-IRR.</p><p>The purpose of the current study is to systematically evaluate and compare the statistical properties of BC-IRR estimated via the GLMM and GEE and to demonstrate the methods using R with real data. The paper is organized into five main sections. The literature review section briefly introduces the difference between conditional and marginal estimates, and formal definition of BC-IRR. The modeling and estimation section outlines the GLMM and GEE frameworks, reviews their performance in small-sample conditions, and discusses small-sample correction methods. The third section presents a simulation study evaluating the performance of both modeling approaches, focusing on the bias of point estimate, bias of standard error, mean squared error, and coverage rate of BC-IRR. The fourth section demonstrates the application of these models using real data and R code. The final section concludes with a discussion of implications, practical recommendations, study limitations, and directions for future research.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conditional and Marginal Estimates for IRR</head><p>The different interpretations between the WC-IRR and BC-IRR in the analysis of SCED count data origins from the statistical decision on whether it is more appropriate to use a conditional model or a marginal model to analyze correlated response data. An extensive and ongoing discussion exists in disciplines such as statistics, biology, ecology, and epidemiology regarding the differences, advantages, and limitations of these two modeling approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Akanda &amp; Alpizar-Jara, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Fieberg et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Heagerty, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Heagerty &amp; Zeger, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Lee &amp; Nelder, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Lindsey &amp; Lambert, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Muff et al., 2016)</ref>. However, the conceptual and technical nuances of both models may remain opaque to researchers in the behavioral and social sciences.</p><p>To facilitate understanding, we begin with a general illustration of conditional and marginal estimates, followed by an example specific to SCEDs. We first consider a two-level linear mixed-effects model (LMM), which can be written as: 𝑦 𝑖𝑗 = 𝒙  However, having both conditional and marginal interpretations is generally not the case for 𝜷 when a non-linear function is adopted in the GLMM framework.</p><p>Consider the corresponding GLMM with a non-normal outcome 𝑦 𝑖𝑗 : In SCEDs, consider the following Poisson GLMM for count outcomes:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">𝑦 𝑖𝑗 |𝒙</formula><formula xml:id="formula_1">𝑌 𝑖𝑗 ~ 𝑃𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑜𝑛 (𝜆 𝑖𝑗 ) Level 1: log(𝜆 𝑖𝑗 ) = 𝛽 0𝑗 + 𝛽 1𝑗 𝑃ℎ𝑎𝑠𝑒 𝑖𝑗 Level 2: { 𝛽 0𝑗 = 𝛾 00 + 𝑢 0𝑗 𝛽 1𝑗 = 𝛾 10 + 𝑢 1𝑗 [ 𝜇 0𝑗 𝜇 1𝑗 ] ~ 𝑀𝑉𝑁 ([ 0 0 ] , 𝐺 = [ 𝜎 𝑢0 2 𝜎 𝑢0𝑢1 𝜎 𝑢1𝑢0 𝜎 𝑢1 2 ]) ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where i and j are the index of repeated measures and cases, respectively, and Phase is a binary variable (0 = baseline and 1 = treatment). The intercept 𝛾 00 represents the within-case bassline level and 𝛾 10 represents the within-case treatment effect in the log-count scale because the log link function is adopted. The effect size for treatment effect in the frequency count scale is assessed by the exp (𝛾 10 ), which is a with-case effect size (i.e., WC-IRR). The between-case variance components (𝜎 𝑢0 2 and 𝜎 𝑢1 2 ) are found on the diagonal of the variance-covariance matrix (i.e., the G matrix), representing the variance of the baseline level and the treatment effect between cases. The off-diagonal element (𝜎 𝑢0𝑢1 ) represents the covariance between baseline level and the treatment effect. To facilitate the understanding of the differences between conditional and marginal estimates, we first provide the expressions for the conditional and marginal expectations based on the Poisson GLMM in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">1</ref> (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Leckie et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>For simplicity, the following illustration focuses on the conditional and marginal estimates for the treatment effect (𝛾 10 ). Assuming 𝛾 10 = 1.77 and 𝜎 𝑢1 2 = 0.30. ) = 6.82. A graphic illustration of the transformation between the log scale and the original data scale in terms of treatment effect estimates is depicted in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>. It is noted that the marginal effect estimated from the GLMM is subject to accuracy for both fixed and random effects estimates. An alternative way to estimate the marginal effect like BC-IRR for SCED count outcomes is through direct marginal modeling. A full illustration of specifications for conditional and marginal models to estimate BC-IRR will be provided in the next section.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Causal Definition of BC-IRR for SCEDs</head><p>The marginal treatment effect aforementioned for SCEDs could be formally defined by utilizing causal inference framework. Let us consider an AB design with m participants and series length of n. For simplicity, assume that all participants enter the treatment phase at time T.</p><p>This assumption is not required, as the definition also applies to multiple baseline designs in which participants enter the treatment phase at different time point. According to Luo et al.</p><p>(2025), BC-IRR is defined as a causal estimand on a ratio scale:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">BC-IRR = 𝐸[𝑌 𝐵 (1)]</formula><p>𝐸[𝑌 𝐵 (0)] .</p><p>(2)</p><p>The numerator represents the expected incidence rate at time B if a treatment strategy is implemented between times T and B. The denominator represents the expected incidence rate at time B if the treatment is never adopted. Both the numerator and the denominator are marginal means, representing the average incidence rates across the m participants under the treated and the untreated conditions. Thus, BC-IRR is a marginal effect.</p><p>Because the estimand is defined based on potential outcomes, it is necessary to link the potential outcomes to the observed data. The numerator can be directly linked to the observed incidence rate at time B because all participants receive the treatment. However, the denominator, the potential outcome under no treatment at time B, is unobserved and must be estimated using models based on observations from the baseline phase. A key identifiability condition, therefore, is that this potential outcome model is correctly specified. Additional details of the statistical models are presented in the next section. BC-IRR has been shown to be equivalent to the IRR that would have been obtained in a hypothetical RCT, under the assumption that a never-treated group exists in which the distribution of individual effects, defined as the time-invariant effects unique to each individual, matches that of the treated units in the SCED. Due to space limit, we do not repeat the detailed derivations here. Readers are referred to <ref type="bibr">Luo et al. (2025)</ref> for the complete logical and mathematical arguments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Estimation Models for BC-IRR</head><p>To estimate BC-IRR as defined in the previous section, we consider two methods, one derived from the conditional/subject-specific model of GLMM, the other based on the marginal/population-average model via the GEE approach.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Generalized Linear Mixed Model</head><p>GLMMs are a set of conditional models that integrate the frameworks of generalized linear models (GLM) and linear mixed models (LMM). Hence, GLMMs could take the source of clustering or nested data structure in SCEDs into account by directly modeling between-case variation using random effects. With an extension to generalized framework, GLMM could also deal with non-normal outcomes in SCEDs, such as binary, percentage/proportion, count, and rate data using various distributions (e.g., Poisson, negative binomial, binomial, beta-binomial).</p><p>We used the following Poisson GLMM to derive BC-IRR from count outcomes in an AB design:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">𝑦 𝑖𝑗 ~ Poisson (𝜆 𝑖𝑗 ) (3) log(𝜆 𝑖𝑗 ) = 𝛽 0𝑗 + 𝛽 1𝑗 𝑇𝑖𝑚𝑒 𝑖𝑗 + 𝛽 2𝑗 𝑃ℎ𝑎𝑠𝑒 𝑖𝑗 + 𝛽 3𝑗 𝑇𝑖𝑚𝑒 𝑖𝑗 ′ 𝑃ℎ𝑎𝑠𝑒 𝑖𝑗</formula><p>where 𝑃ℎ𝑎𝑠𝑒 𝑖𝑗 is an indicator variable equal to 0 for control phase and 1 for treatment phase;</p><p>𝑇𝑖𝑚𝑒 𝑖𝑗 is a time variable representing the time (measured either in calendar units or sessions) elapsed from a reference time point. Researchers can choose any time point as a reference time point, which changes the meaning of the intercept 𝛽 0𝑗 and its associated variance-covariance components. 𝑇𝑖𝑚𝑒 𝑖𝑗 ′ is another centered time variable which equals zero for the first session in the treatment phase. Based on this coding scheme, 𝑒 𝛽 0𝑗 represents the expected outcome level at the last session in baseline for case j, 𝑒 𝛽 1𝑗 represents the proportional change per session in the baseline phase, 𝑒 𝛽 2𝑗 represents the immediate proportional change in the outcome level after the treatment (i.e., the within-case IRR for immediate effect), and 𝑒 𝛽 3𝑗 represents the trend/slope change after the treatment (i.e., the within-case IRR for trend change). An example coding matrix for all the variables is shown in Table <ref type="table">2</ref>, where 𝐶 is the reference time point, the treatment is implemented at time 𝑇 = 𝐴, and the outcome 𝑌 is measured at time point 𝐵.</p><p>Based on a multivariate normal assumption for all random coefficients (i.e., 𝛽 0𝑗 -𝛽 3𝑗 )</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">[ 𝛽 0𝑗 𝛽 1𝑗 𝛽 2𝑗 𝛽 3𝑗] ~MVN [ 𝛾 00 𝛾 10 𝛾 20 𝛾 30 ] [ 𝜎 𝑢0 2 𝜎 𝑢0𝑢1 𝜎 𝑢0𝑢1 𝜎 𝑢1 2 𝜎 𝑢0𝑢2 𝜎 𝑢0𝑢3 𝜎 𝑢1𝑢2 𝜎 𝑢1𝑢3 𝜎 𝑢0𝑢2 𝜎 𝑢1𝑢2 𝜎 𝑢0𝑢3 𝜎 𝑢1𝑢3 𝜎 𝑢2 2 𝜎 𝑢2𝑢3 𝜎 𝑢2𝑢3 𝜎 𝑢3 2 ]<label>(4)</label></formula><p>, the expression of marginal exception in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">1</ref>, and the coding matrix in Table 2</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">BC-IRR = 𝐸[𝑌 𝐵 (1)] 𝐸[𝑌 𝐵 (0)] = 𝑒 𝛾 20 + 1 2 𝜎 𝑢2 2 +𝜎 𝑢0𝑢2 +(𝐵-𝐶)𝜎 𝑢1𝑢2 +𝛾 30 (𝐵-A)+ 1 2 (𝐵-𝐴) 2 𝜎 𝑢3 2 +(𝐵-𝐴)𝜎 𝑢0𝑢3 +(𝐵-𝐴)𝜎 𝑢2𝑢3 +(𝐵-𝐶)(𝐵-𝐴)𝜎 𝑢1𝑢3 ,<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where The Poisson GLMM in equation 3 assumes that the conditional mean and variance for the outcome are identical. However, when count data exhibit more variability than predicted by the Poisson model, overdispersion occurs.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Marginal Model via Generalized Estimating Equation</head><p>Rather than explicitly modeling the clustering mechanism via random effects as is done with the conditional models of GLMM, marginal models treat within-subject association as a nuisance characteristic of data that should be accounted for to make correct inferences about changes in the population mean response <ref type="bibr">(Liang &amp; Zeger, 1986)</ref>. A marginal model for longitudinal data has the following three-part specification <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Fitzmaurice, 2012)</ref>: ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">1</ref> When the outcomes in the marginal model are discrete (e.g., binary, count, or ordinal categorical data), there is no convenient specification of the joint distribution of 𝒀 𝑗 . Hence, it requires an alternative to maximum likelihood estimation and leads to a method known as generalized estimation equations (GEE). GEE approach essentially views the model as a singlelevel model and apply statistical corrections to produce standard error estimates that account for clustering <ref type="bibr">(Liang &amp; Zeger, 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr">Zeger &amp; Liang, 1986)</ref>. The advantage of GEE is that the covariance structure of the outcome does not have to be correctly specified, meaning that there are far fewer assumptions required compared to random effects models <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Zeger et al., 1988)</ref>. For the estimation, GEE requires researchers to specify a working correlation matrix (i.e., Corr(𝒀 𝑗 )</p><p>and then start an iterative estimation process using weighted least squares (quasi-likelihood) by</p><p>(1) estimating the regression coefficients (𝜷) as if data are independent, (2) estimating the parameters (𝜶) in the working correlation matrix to handle clustering, (3) using the estimated working correlation matrix to update the outcome variable covariance matrix (𝑽 𝑗 ), (4) using 𝑽 𝑗 to update estimates of 𝜷; and (5) continuing this iteration process until convergence and then applying sandwich estimate estimators for stander errors. For an approachable illustration of the full estimation procedure for GEE, readers are referred to <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">McNeish and Stapleton (2016)</ref>.</p><p>In SCEDs, BC-IRR could be estimated by specifying a marginal model using the GEE approach with an appropriate working correlation matrix. The marginal model is specified as follows for count outcomes:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">𝐸(𝑦 𝑖𝑗 |𝒙 𝑖𝑗 ) = 𝜆 𝑖𝑗 , log(𝜆 𝑖𝑗 ) = 𝛽 0 + 𝛽 1 𝑇𝑖𝑚𝑒 𝑖𝑗 + 𝛽 2 𝑃ℎ𝑎𝑠𝑒 𝑖𝑗 + 𝛽 3 𝑇𝑖𝑚𝑒 𝑖𝑗 ′ 𝑃ℎ𝑎𝑠𝑒 𝑖𝑗 . (7) 𝑉𝑎𝑟(𝑦 𝑖𝑗 |𝒙 𝑖𝑗 ) = 𝜙𝑣(𝜆 𝑖𝑗 ) 𝑽 𝑗 = 𝜙𝑨 𝑗 1 2 𝑹 𝑗 (𝜶)𝑨 𝑗 1 2</formula><p>where the Poisson variance function 𝑣(𝜆 𝑖𝑗 ) = 𝜆 𝑖𝑗 is adopted and the scaler parameter 𝜙 could handle potential overdispersion in SCED count outcomes. The working correlation structure 𝑹 𝑗 (𝜶) describes the correlation pattern of observations within-subject with 𝜶 as a vector of association parameters depending on the correlation structure. In our study, we adopt the "independence" correlation structure to avoid convergence issues encountered with very small sample sizes in SCEDs. We note that other correlation structures including, but not limited to, "unstructured", "autoregressive", "Toeplitz", and "exchangeable" are available for the GEE approach. Based on equations ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">7</ref>),</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">BC-IRR = 𝑒 (𝛽 2 +𝛽 3 (𝐵-𝐴)) , (<label>8</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_9">)</formula><p>where 𝛽 2 and 𝛽 3 represent the marginal estimates of the immediate effect and trend change, respectively. A key advantage of the GEE over GLMM is that it does not require specifying the level-2 variance-covariance structure of random effects. The GEE approach could provide robust estimates of standard errors if all relevant predictors are included, regardless of the proper specification of the working correlation matrix of the outcome measurements <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(McNeish &amp; Harring, 2017)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Delta Methods for Standard Errors</head><p>As BC-IRR is essentially a combination or a transformation of parameter estimates related to the immediate effect and regarding trend change, we need to further calculate its standard error.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Simulation Study Data Generation</head><p>Data were simulated using a negative binomial GLMM as shown in equation 6. We varied the following design factors, including series length (𝐼), number of cases (𝐽), immediate effect (𝛾 20 ), trend change (𝛾 30 ), variance components (𝜎 𝑢0 2 , 𝜎 𝑢1 2 , 𝜎 𝑢2 2 , 𝜎 𝑢3 2 ), dispersion (𝜃), and the time elapsed between intervention and measurement sessions (𝐵 -𝐴). The chosen conditions and associated rationale are similar to the previous simulation studies with SCED count data <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Declercq et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Li et al., 2024)</ref>. Specifically, the number of cases was 4 or 8, and the series length was 10 or 20. This represented a common setting based on reviews of single-case studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Pustejovsky et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Shadish &amp; Sullivan, 2011)</ref>. Following the MBD, the start of the treatment was staggered across cases: 𝐼 = 10 (starting points of the intervention: 3, 4, 6, 7) and 𝐼 = 20 (starting points of the intervention: 6, 8, 12, 14). The trend in the baseline phase 𝛾 10 = log(1.00) and thus there is no trend in the baseline phase. The immediate effect 𝛾 20 was set to was set to log(1.00), log (2.00), log (6.00), or log (12.00), representing the zero, small, medium, and large treatment conditions, respectively. For trend change 𝛾 30 , the zero, medium, and large effects were set to log(1.00), log(1.05) and log(1.10), which leads to the frequency count increasing by 0%, 5%, and 10% for each measurement in the treatment phase, respectively.</p><p>The between-case variance components for the intercept (𝜎 𝑢0 2 ), baseline trend (𝜎 𝑢1 2 ), immediate effect (𝜎 𝑢2 2 ) and trend change (𝜎 𝑢3 2 ) were paired as [0.1, 0, 0.1,0], [0.3, 0.0003, 0.3, 0.0003], or [0.5, 0.0005, 0.5, 0.0005]. Following the same practice in <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Moeyaert et al. (2016)</ref>, the correlations between all random effects were set as -0.5. The 1:1000 ratio of 𝜎 𝑢1 2 and 𝜎 𝑢3 2 versus 𝜎 𝑢0 2 and 𝜎 𝑢2 2 was also determined based on the reanalysis of SCED count data in previous metaanalyses <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Dart et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Ledford et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Verschuur et al., 2014)</ref>.

In GEE models, we applied four small-sample corrections in addition to the sandwich estimator, GEE_LZ (𝚽 𝐿𝑍 ), to get standard errors of coefficients, including GEE_KC (𝚽 𝐾𝐶 ) , GEE_MD (𝚽 𝑀𝐷 ), GEE_FG (𝚽 𝐹𝐺 ), and GEE_MBN (𝚽 𝑀𝐵𝑁 ). All corrections were implemented using the R package geesmv <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Wang et al., 2015)</ref>. For GLMMs, we allowed all variance components and only one covariance between random intercept and immediate effect to be freely estimated to avoid convergence issues. Hence, the fitted GLMMs were under-specified regarding the level-2 variance-covariance structure, which allows us to examine the robustness of GLMMs for the misspecification. For both GLMM and GEE, each model was estimated using two reference time points (C), namely, the first and last sessions of the baseline phase, whereas the data were consistently generated with C at the last session of the baseline phase. This allows us to examine whether BC-IRR is robust to different coding strategies adopted for 𝑇𝑖𝑚𝑒 𝑖𝑗 . Standard errors of BC-IRRs for both models were computed via the delta method using the R package msm <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Jackson, 2011)</ref>.

The GEE_FG correction showed the largest bias (median = 0.50) and the largest variability across conditions (IQR = 0.87), reflecting systematic over-correction of the standard error.

All effects that were reported in the Results section had statistical significance at the α = .05 level. To concentrate on the most consequential sources of variation, we used scree-type plots of the ordered 𝜂 2 values to find main effects and interaction terms that fall to the left of the "elbow" point, which is analogous to using the scree plots to determine the number of factors in exploratory factor analyses <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Li, 2024)</ref>.</p><p>The bias of BC-IRR was mainly impacted by the time elapsed (𝐹(2, 554) = 2518.41, 𝜂 2 = .19) and the interaction of the intercept variance and the time elapsed (𝐹(4, 554) = 1344.96, 𝜂 2 = .20). As depicted in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6</ref>, when the between-case variance of the intercept was set at its smallest level (𝜎 00 2 = 0.1), the bias remained at the lowest level across different conditions of time elapsed.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>GLMM results</head><p>For Scenario 1, based on equation 17, the parameters used to calculate BC-IRR are the immediate effect ( 𝛾 10 = .30), the variance of the random effects associated with immediate effect (𝜎 𝑢1 2 = 0.004), and the covariance between the baseline intercept and immediate effect (𝜎 𝑢0𝑢1 = 0.005). The estimated BC-IRR was exp(0.30 + 0.004/2 + 0.005) = 1.36, indicating that the expected (marginal) rate ratio between the baseline and the treatment phase across all cases is 1.36. This means that the DPCM on average increased by 36% after the treatment across participants (SE = 0.10, 95% CI = 1.17-1.45). In this scenario, BC-IRR remains constant across all durations of the treatments, because there is no trend in the treatment phase.</p><p>For Scenario 2, based on equation 21, the parameters used to calculate BC-IRR are the immediate effect (𝛾 20 = 0.27), trend change (𝛾 30 = .008), the variance of the random effect associated with immediate effect (𝜎 𝑢2 2 = 0.003), and the covariance between the baseline intercept and shift in level treatment effect (𝜎 𝑢0𝑢2 = 0.005). For example, when B-A=3, the estimated BC-IRR was exp[0.27 + (0.008 * 3) + 0.003/2 + .005] = 1.34, indicating the DPCM increased by 34% after 4 sessions of intervention (SE = 0.18, 95% CI = 1.00-1.69). This effect is comparable to the effect that would have been obtained from a potential RCT in which participants in the treatment group are consecutively treated for 4 sessions and the outcomes measured immediately after session 4 are compared with those from a never-treated control group.</p><p>For Scenario 3, the GLMM did not converge due to non-positive-definite Hessian matrix when estimating standard errors of fixed effects.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>GEE results</head><p>For Scenario 1, based on equation 19, the parameter used to calculate BC-IRR is marginal shift in level treatment effect (𝛽 1 = 0.33). The estimated BC-IRR was exp(0.33) = 1.39, indicating the DPCM increased by 39% averagely after the treatment across participants (KC-adjusted SE = 0.02, 95% CI = 1.34-1.44; MD-adjusted SE = 0.02, 95% CI = 1.35-1.43).</p><p>For Scenario 2 and 3 using GEE model, based on equation 23, the parameter used to calculate BC-IRR is the marginal immediate effect (𝛽 2 = 0.27) and the marginal trend change (𝛽 3 = 0.002). For example, when B-A=3, The estimated BC-IRR was exp(0.27 + 0.002*4) = 1.31, indicating the DPCM increased 31% averagely after 5 sessions (KC-adjusted SE = 0.09, 95% CI = 1.13-1.49; MD-adjusted SE = 0.10, 95% CI = 1.12-1.50). Same with GLMM-based BC-IRR, this effect is comparable to the effect that would have been obtained from a potential RCT in which participants in the treatment group are consecutively treated for 4 sessions and the outcomes measured immediately after session 4 are compared with those from a never-treated control group.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>The present study systematically evaluated the statistical properties of BC-IRR when estimated via GLMMs and GEEs. Through a Monte Carlo simulation, we assessed the bias, MSE, and converge rate of BC-IRR estimators and compared the performance of various estimators for their standard errors with GLMM and GEE. We also included a real-data demonstration by calculating BC-IRR, its standard errors and confidence intervals under different model specifications based on researchers' prior knowledge under commonly encountered scenarios.</p><p>Overall, the simulation results suggest that both GLMM and GEE approaches yield accurate estimates of BC-IRR across various conditions. Although BC-ICC tends to be slightly overestimated when the time elapsed 𝐵 -𝐴 increases and the intercept variance becomes relatively large, the magnitudes of the bias are still trivial and meaningless in practice. Similarly, the standard errors of BC-IRR based on GLMM, and two corrections with GEE_KC and GEE_MD are relatively unbiased, whereas biased standard errors estimate are found in the sandwich estimator GEE_LZ, and the other two corrections with GEE_FG and GEE_MBN.</p><p>Notably, the GEE_FG shows significant overcorrections for standard errors in small samples, which aligns with previous findings <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Leyrat et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Scott et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Thompson et al., 2021)</ref>. Both point estimates and standard error estimates of BC-IRR are not sensitive to the different choices of the reference point C and the misspecification of the level-2 variancecovariance structure (only for GLMM). The robustness of BC-IRR against potential misspecification allows researchers to adjust model specifications to resolve convergence issues without sacrificing estimation accuracy. Regarding the efficiency of BC-IRR estimators, GLMMs are slightly more efficient than GEE, while significant less efficiency is observed for both when the series length is 10 and the 𝐵 -𝐴 is 5.</p><p>For interval estimates, BC-IRR shows substantial under-coverage relative to the nominal level of 95% across all examined methods. When the number of cases is 8, the coverage rates are close to the nominal level for GLMM and GEE_MD. This finding is consistent with the known limitations of Wald-type confidence intervals in small samples. The Wald confidence intervals are adopted due to the lack of well-defined degrees of freedom for BC-IRR under either GLMM or GEE. We also caution that the interval estimate of BC-IRR should not be used for the purpose of statistical inferences of treatment effectiveness for a single study, not only because of the under-coverage found in the simulation, but also the inconsistency between the design in the null hypothesis (i.e., a hypothetical group-based design) and the data obtained from a single-case study. For statistical inferences in a single study, researchers should adopt WC-IRR, to evaluate the effectiveness of treatments on a typical case (i.e., all random effects = 0) or cases with the same random effects.</p><p>Based on the theoretical framework, simulation results, and observed convergence issues, we provide the following recommendations for researchers to calculate BC-IRR and obtain standard errors in their own study: (1) when researchers use GLMM to calculate BC-IRR and its standard error, determine the complexity of level-2 covariance structures based on prior theory and/or visual analyses. Starting from Scenario 2 or 3 is recommended to mitigate convergence problems;</p><p>(2) if convergence issues are encountered or level-2 variance-covariance structures are difficult to specify, consider using GEE with an independent working correlation structure. For more accurate standard error estimates, GEE_KC or GEE_MD are recommended; and (3) When using a range of time elapsed 𝐵 -𝐴 values, it is important to note the longest treatment duration that is observed across all cases. We recommend computing BC-IRRs for 𝐵 -𝐴 values within the range. Choosing a 𝐵 -𝐴 that is longer than what was actually observed requires extrapolating the time trend beyond the data and the accuracy of the estimates could be questionable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations and Future Directions</head><p>Given that the calculation for BC-IRR relies on multiple fixed effects and variance components in the GLMM and that the undesirable statistical properties found for the GEE approach with small sample sizes in previous studies, the results from our study under the SCED context are very encouraging for further methodological studies. The findings are constrained by the selected simulation conditions, which, although typical in MBDs, may not generalize to other research contexts or designs. To release the full potential of calculating BC-IRR with an aim to synthesize results from both SCEDs and group-based designs, there are several important issues yet to be investigated. A thorough investigation of these issues is beyond the scope of this study, but we discuss them here to suggest directions for future research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Bayesian Approach</head><p>In practice, researchers applying BC-IRR in SCEDs using GLMMs may face convergence challenges, or difficulty specifying variance-covariance structures. While GEEs offer a marginal modeling approach that can address some of these concerns, experienced researchers may still prefer GLMMs when prior theory or visual inspection supports their use, especially for improved efficiency. Bayesian estimation presents a promising alternative in this context. R packages such as brms <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bürkner, 2017)</ref> and GLMMadaptive <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Rizopoulos, 2022)</ref> allow Bayesian GLMM fitting and offer tools to derive marginal estimates from conditional ones.</p><p>Future studies should investigate the convergence properties and small-sample bias of BC-IRR estimates under a Bayesian framework.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Degrees of Freedom of BC-IRR</head><p>Although standard error estimates of BC-IRR via GLMM, GEE_KC, and GEE_MD are relatively unbiased, their associated Wald confidence intervals exhibited poor coverage. A critical unresolved issue is how to appropriately define degrees of freedom for BC-IRR, given its reliance on multiple components from GLMM or GEE. The Satterthwaite approximation <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Satterthwaite, 1946)</ref> may offer a viable solution, given its favorable statistical properties found in dealing with small samples in SCED contexts (citations). Deriving Satterthwaite-type degrees of freedom for composite effect sizes like BC-IRR could be considered for future methodological work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Outcome Scales</head><p>This study focused on count outcomes, which are frequently observed in SCEDs.</p><p>However, other outcome types, such as rates, proportions, percentages, and ordinal or continuous scores from surveys, are also common. These varied outcome scales complicate synthesis across studies, as different distributions (e.g., Gaussian, Poisson, Binomial) entail different assumptions about the relationship between the mean and variance. Multilevel modeling frameworks have been adapted to produce appropriate effect sizes for these outcome types, yet the incompatibility of obtained effect sizes can hinder meta-analyses aiming to aggregate diverse findings. The GEE-based BC-IRR, which makes no distributional assumptions, may provide a solution. Future research should explore the performance of GEE based proportional effect sizes when applied to count, rate, proportion/percentage, and continuous outcomes.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>(a) the conditional difference in outcomes between individuals with the same random effects (e.g., typical individual with 𝒖 𝑗 = 0) and (b) the average treatment effect across the population.</figDesc></figure>
