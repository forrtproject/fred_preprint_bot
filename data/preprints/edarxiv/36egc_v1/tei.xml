<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>All 7th grade students from all three public middle schools in the Leuwiliang Subdistrict-1 Leuwiliang State Middle School, 2 Junior High School, and Leuwiliang 3 Public Middle School-were enrolled in the study, which was carried out at the Leuwiliang Sub-District Middle School in Bogor Regency. Using random sampling techniques, 40 participants made up the 10% of the samples that were taken. In order to test hypotheses stating whether or not there is a relationship between independent variables (X1) and (X2) and dependent variables (Y), a descriptive method that is systematic, factual, accurate descriptive of facts and the relationship between the phenomena investigated is used. referring to the regression test's findings. The contextual learning approach has an impact on PAI in terms of helping students develop their character. Contextual learning techniques have an impact on pupils' character development and motivation to pray, according to Islamic education educators. Islamic education in schools is taught using a contextual method that imparts knowledge, appreciation, and encourages pupils to practice and relate it with daily life because they experience the benefits and wisdom in it.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. INTRODUCTION</head><p>Education is an effort to realize the potential that exists in each student to produce quality human beings, who have knowledge and morals based on the values of faith and piety <ref type="bibr">(Sulfemi 2024)</ref>. Education also functions to shape personality <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Susanti 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Arsyad and Sulfemi 2024)</ref>. The concept of education is also the formulation of national education goals as confirmed in the Republic of Indonesia Law. No. 20 of 2003 article 3 <ref type="bibr">(Sulfemi 2023b</ref>). The objectives of national education are implemented further through the objectives of Islamic Religious Education (PAI) in SMP/MTs, namely to: (1) develop faith through the provision, cultivation and development of knowledge, habituation, appreciation, practice, as well as students' practice of the Islamic religion so that they become Muslim humans who are devoted to Allah <ref type="bibr">SWT (Arifia et al. 2023)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(2)</ref> have the ability to worship guided by Islamic law. (3) realizing Indonesian people who are diverse and have noble character, namely people who are knowledgeable, intelligent, productive, honest, fair, diligent in worship, ethical, disciplined, tolerant (tasamuh), maintain personal and social harmony and develop Islamic culture in schools. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Sulfemi 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Pratiwi 2023)</ref>. PAI learning outcomes are not only seen from the cognitive and psychomotor domains, but also seen from the affective domain results (Syarifuddin, <ref type="bibr">Heryadi, and Sulfemi 2021)</ref>. These three domains are interconnected with each other and strengthen each other, so that the results will produce students who are obedient in worship with strong character as Muslims who obey Allah SWT <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Sulfemi and Yuliana 2019)</ref>.</p><p>Strengthening beliefs and character through PAI learning is a process of formation, transformation, transmission and development of students' potential to worship well, think well and behave well in accordance with the values of Islamic teachings <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Sulfemi, Arsyad, and Nurlelasari 2022)</ref>.</p><p>However, in its implementation, PAI learning in schools has not been able to lead to the substance of PAI learning objectives, namely learning outcomes that reflect integration between aspects of Islamic religious knowledge (cognitive aspects), and become a means of transforming moral norms and values to form attitudes and can play a role in controlling behavior <ref type="bibr">(Sulfemi 2019)</ref>. Based on a preliminary study conducted at State Junior High Schools in Leuwiliang District, Bogor Regency, the results of the recapitulation of PAI scores for eighth grade Leuwiliang State Middle School students averaged between 75-85. This means that the average score is in the complete category and includes good results. However, the results of PAI learning do not reflect the competency achievements that have been determined in the curriculum. This can be seen in students' worship, such as performing prayers at school, showing that the average number of students who perform midday prayers, both alone and in congregation at school, is around 70. %, there are around 30% of students who do not pray at school due to behavior or reasons such as, some deliberately delay praying, some play, chat with friends, and some even lie that they have prayed. This shows that students' motivation to perform prayers is still relatively low Apart from that, whether we admit it or not, there is currently a real and worrying moral crisis in society involving students <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Sulfemi and Muniroh 2019)</ref>. This moral crisis includes cases of students persecuting their friends, bullying habits at school, even daring to fight and challenge teachers to fights, not to mention the delinquent behavior of students which occurs in several places or schools and continues continuously and tends to be repeated over and over again, such as student brawls, promiscuity with the opposite sex, student motorcycle gangs, and beatings by seniors against juniors which often result in deaths. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Sulfemi, Heryadi, and Syarifuddin 2021)</ref>.</p><p>This problem arises, among other things, because the results of PAI learning in schools have not been able to provide understanding, habituation and awareness of the obligations and responsibilities to obey and comply with religious rules and norms, this is influenced by several factors: (1) the ability of students is heterogeneous, (2) time or hours for Islamic religious studies are still limited; (3) students' interest is greater in other subjects; (4) facilities, infrastructure and media to strengthen understanding and implementation of the Islamic religion are still limited; (5) assessment of PAI learning outcomes is only measured by how much learning material is memorized and written exams in class that students can demonstrate; and (6) approaches and methods in the PAI learning process in the classroom tend to emphasize more on memorization, and learning tends to be limited to text, and does not prepare students to respond and face real life <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Sulfemi, Fajartriani, and Handayani 2021)</ref>.</p><p>PAI learning outcomes will certainly be difficult to achieve if the targets, objectives, materials and learning methods, which are the most important instruments in the learning process, are not appropriate to the students' conditions. In connection with the PAI learning problem, it will have an impact on: first, students' low appreciation and practice of worship, such as motivation to perform prayers, because the PAI learning approach and method involves more memorizing material than appreciation and practice of worship in relation to daily life. -day. Second, the low morality of students is also due to a lack of appreciation and practice of the meaning and benefits of doing good to others, as contained in PAI lesson material.</p><p>For this reason, approaches and methods are needed in PAI learning that can instill habits by involving students in solving problems, but do not neglect their ability to think according to their level of intelligence. The approach and method in learning is the contextual learning method. In contextual learning, the teacher as a facilitator is responsible for providing stimulation and motivation, diagnosing and overcoming difficulties, and providing experiences to grow students' understanding. According to Arsyad, one of the problems regarding achieving learning outcomes is teachers. There are still many teachers who have not been able to develop and apply interesting learning methodologies that vary according to the field or topic and age of the students. For this reason, the teacher's teaching competence will have an impact on the quality aspects of the learning process activities, a teacher's mastery of the material is very influential in improving the quality of the learning process in the classroom.</p><p>Contextual learning can help teachers to link the material they teach with real world situations to encourage students to make connections between the knowledge they have and its application in everyday life <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Sulfemi and Mayasari 2019)</ref>. In PAI learning, a contextual approach is needed due to the fact that most students are not yet able to connect what they learn with its benefits in real life. This condition is based on the understanding that students gain is not yet fully necessary in their daily practice.</p><p>Sanjaya said that the contextual teaching and learning (CTL) learning method is a learning approach that emphasizes the involvement of students in finding the material being studied and connecting it with real life situations in everyday life <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Sulfemi and Yuliani 2019)</ref>.</p><p>From the description above, it is important to carry out research on this problem with the aim of gaining knowledge about the extent of the influence of the contextual learning approach in PAI lessons which can provide knowledge, understanding and practice of Islamic teaching values to students, so that they can have an influence on their lives. Based on this, the aim of this research is to find out: first, the influence of the contextual learning approach in PAI lessons on students' prayer motivation. Second, the influence of the contextual learning approach in PAI lessons on strengthening students' character. Third, the influence of the contextual learning approach in PAI lessons on prayer motivation and strengthening students' character. Leuwiliang with 4 study groups with 120 students, so the total population is 396 students. The number of samples taken was 10%, so the total sample was 40 students using a random sampling technique from the existing population, or simple random sampling. <ref type="bibr">(Sulfemi 2023a)</ref>.</p><p>The method used is the descriptive method, namely making systematic, factual and accurate descriptions of the facts and relationships between the phenomena being investigated, with the aim of testing the hypothesis which states whether there is a relationship or not between each variable, both independent (X1) and (X2) with the dependent variable (Y) <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Sulfemi and Yasita 2020)</ref>. The data analysis used is regression and correlation analysis. Regression analysis is to test whether or not there is an influence between the variables studied. Meanwhile, correlation analysis wants to know how big the level of influence is between variable Y and variable (Sulfemi 2020)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. FINDINGS AND DISCUSSION</head><p>The analysis of this research is to prove the hypothesis proposed: first, that from the results of regression and correlation analysis it is found that the contextual learning method in PAI (Y) has an effect on students' prayer motivation (X1) which is described by the equation = 0.622 + 0.332 X1. This regression equation can be used as a tool to explain and draw conclusions regarding contextual learning methods in PAI (Y) by strengthening students' prayer motivation (X1). This equation means that every increase in one unit of the contextual learning method in PAI will increase 0.322 of students' prayer motivation with a constant of 0.622. Furthermore, from the results of the t test analysis, tcount is 5.383 and ttable is 2.02, because tcount &gt; ttable, namely 5.383&gt;2.02, with a coefficient of determination of 0.4343 which explains that 43.43% of the variance in the student prayer motivation variable is determined by contextual method variables in PAI.</p><p>The conclusion of the proposed null hypothesis (H0) that there is an influence of contextual learning methods in PAI on strengthening students' prayer motivation is acceptable. This means that the contextual learning method has a positive influence on strengthening students' motivation to perform prayers. Second, from the results of regression and correlation analysis it was found that the contextual learning method in PAI (Y) had an effect on strengthening students' character (X2) which was described by the equation = -2.920 + 0.390X2. This regression equation can be used as a tool to explain and draw conclusions regarding the contextual method in PAI (Y) by strengthening students' character (X2). This equation means that every increase in one unit of the contextual learning method in PAI will increase 0.390 units of character strengthening of students with a constant of -2.920. This means that the contextual learning method in PAI (Y) has an effect on strengthening students' character (X2), because tcount &gt; ttable, namely 4.971 &gt; 2.02. The coefficient of determination of 0.3944 explains that 39.44% of the variance in strengthening students' character is determined by contextual method variables in PAI.</p><p>Thus, the null hypothesis H (Ho) proposed that there is an influence of contextual learning methods in PAI on strengthening students' character can be accepted. This means that the contextual method has a positive influence on strengthening students' character. Third, from the results of regression and correlation analysis it was found that the contextual learning method in PAI (Y) had an effect on strengthening students' prayer motivation and strengthening students' character (X2) which is described by the regression line equation Ŷ = -14.424 + 0.253X1 + 0.284X2, The calculation of the double correlation X1 and , this shows that there is an influence between the application of contextual methods in PAI and strengthening prayer motivation and students' character. The coefficient of determination (R2 is 0.786). This shows that 78.90% of the increase in strengthening students' prayer motivation and strengthening students' character is influenced by contextual learning methods in PAI together, through the regression equation Ŷ = -14.424 + 0.253X1 + 0.284X2.</p><p>The conclusion from the proposed null hypothesis H (Ho) is that the influence of contextual learning methods in PAI on strengthening prayer motivation and strengthening students' character is acceptable. This means that the contextual learning method has a positive influence on strengthening prayer motivation and strengthening the character of students.</p><p>Referring to the results of regression and correlation tests, this research can be interpreted as: first, there is a positive influence between the contextual learning method variables in PAI (Y) on strengthening students' prayer motivation (X1). Second, there is a positive influence between the contextual learning method variables in PAI (Y) on strengthening students' character (X2). Third, there is a positive influence between the contextual learning method variable in PAI (Y) on strengthening students' prayer motivation (X1) and strengthening students' character (X2). To achieve this goal well, several factors are needed. Among the most important factors in the learning process are the teacher and the learning methods used in the classroom. According to Arsyad and Salahudin, to obtain maximum learning results cannot be separated from two main factors, namely internal factors including students' motivation or interest in learning, and external factors of the school through teacher and family programs through parental guidance <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Inah and Sulfemi 2019)</ref>. Teacher involvement in providing teaching, guidance and role models encourages students to understand, know and practice what they see and feel in everyday life, such as encouragement to perform the five daily prayers and encouragement to behave well. For this reason, teachers must use the right approach so that PAI material is easily understood and understood by students, one of which is the contextual learning approach. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Arsyad and Sulfemi (2020)</ref> said that the implications of the pattern of Islamic character formation that had been carried out by Rasulullah SAW in non-formal education channels, namely: (1) functioning of mosques as centers of activities for non-formal education pathways; (2) the supervisors and implementers of the activities should be people whose character and hearts are connected to the mosque; (3) the orientation of activities should be towards issues of faith, morals, knowledge and charity; (4) forming associations, social organizations that are Islamic and spearheaded by young Muslims and synergize with character formation in the family and community <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Sulfemi, Saptarin, and Toni Heryad 2021)</ref> There is a need for a contextual approach in learning, especially in PAI subjects, because so far learning has not been based on the fact that most students are unable to connect what they learn with how it is used in real life, because the approach patterns and learning strategies are not appropriate. With a contextual approach, students are expected to have the ability to increase their faith, understanding, appreciation and practice of the Islamic religion, so that they become Muslim people who believe and are devoted to Allah SWT. as well as having noble morals in personal life and in society, reflected, among other things, in the motivation to perform the five daily prayers as an obligation of a mature Muslim and honest behavior, respectful and obedient behavior towards parents and teachers as well as empathetic behavior towards others in everyday life. This is in line with the results of <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Jamil (2019)</ref> research which explains that students who have good prayer discipline will always remember Allah who gives life and life. Remembering Allah will prevent all forms of laziness and lethargy, as well as feelings of unease and fear when making mistakes and negligence in carrying out obligations so that students can concentrate on learning. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Heryadi, Sulfemi, and Retnowati 2020)</ref> Thus, the contextual approach in learning PAI in schools provides knowledge, appreciation and encourages students to practice and relate it to everyday life, because they feel the wisdom and benefits in real life, this can be seen in increasing the implementation of prayers and honest behavior. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Sulfemi and Kamalia 2020)</ref> Respectful and obedient behavior towards parents and teachers as well as empathetic behavior towards others also seems to be getting better. This is in line with what Amril expressed, that Islamic education, both as an institution and as a subject or course, including research and development of Islamic sciences, especially those with an integrative-interconnective epistemological paradigm, is a strategic instrument for revealing ideal moral messages in Islam. then reach for it so that peace and advice are free from domination and repression as a real form of the Islamic character rahmatan lil al'alamin in the social reality of life becoming increasingly functional. <ref type="bibr">(Susanti n.d.)</ref> Thus, if learning is designed to develop complete competence between knowledge, skills and attitudes, students are not only expected to increase their knowledge and insight, but also increase their skills and abilities and their character and personality will become nobler.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Conclusions and Suggestions</head><p>Referring to the results of data analysis, this research can be interpreted as: first, there is an influence of contextual learning methods in PAI on strengthening students' prayer motivation. Thus, it can be concluded that the proposed null hypothesis H (H0) can be accepted. Second, there is the influence of contextual learning methods in PAI on strengthening students' character. Thus it can be concluded that the proposed null hypothesis H (Ho) can be accepted. Third, there is the influence of the contextual learning method in PAI on strengthening prayer motivation and strengthening the character of participants. Thus, it can be concluded that the proposed null Ha (Ho) hypothesis can be accepted. With a contextual approach in learning PAI in schools, it provides knowledge, appreciation and encourages students to practice and relate it to everyday life, because they feel the wisdom and benefits in real life, this can be seen in the increase in the implementation of prayers and honest behavior, respectful behavior and Obedience to parents and teachers and empathetic behavior towards others also appear to be getting better.</p><p>From the results of the research and discussion, there are several suggestions made, namely: first, that PAI learning in schools should not only be conveyed and measured in the cognitive aspect in the form of numerical assessments, but PAI learning must be conveyed and measured by instilling religious values. and the extent of its practice in everyday life. Second, strengthening students' prayer motivation and character through PAI is very relevant, for this reason, PAI teachers in schools should pay attention to methods and approaches that are suitable for PAI subject matter, especially methods that can foster understanding while being able to practice it in everyday life. Third, in implementing contextual learning methods in PAI, teachers should apply learning management with an approach; observing, asking, experimenting/exploring, association and communication, so that students are able to formulate the wisdom and benefits of prayer and good deeds in life, and can practice them every day, both at school, home and in the community.</p></div>
