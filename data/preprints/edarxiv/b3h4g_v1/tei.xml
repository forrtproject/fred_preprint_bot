<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>A frequently encountered security issue in writing tests is non-authentic text submission: test takers submit texts that are not of their own but are copies of texts prepared by someone else. In this paper, we propose AutoESD, a human-in-the-loop and automated system to detect non-authentic texts for a large-scale writing test, and report its performance on an operational data set. The AutoESD system utilizes multiple automated text similarity measures to identify suspect texts and provides an analytics-enhanced web application to help human expert to review the identied texts. To evaluate the performance of AutoESD, we obtained its similarity measures on TOEFL iBT writing responses collected from multiple remote administrations and examined their distributions. The results were highly encouraging in that the distributional characteristics of AutoESD similarity measures were eective in identifying suspect texts and that the measures could be computed quickly without aecting the operational score turnaround timeline at all.</p></div>
