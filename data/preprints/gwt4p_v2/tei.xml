<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>We present a non-invasive stimulation technique called Sonoception that utilizes synthetic auditory frequencies at 6Hz and 2Hz to modulate behavioral, physiological, and neural responses in healthy humans. In three studies, we investigated the effects of Sonoception on emotional processing and inhibitory control, cortical processing of cardiac signals, and brain activation patterns. In Study 1, participants completed a Go/No-go task with faces showing disgusted or neutral expressions to assess the influence of the auditory stimulation on inhibitory control in emotional contexts. The 6Hz stimulation decreased false alarms for neutral faces, whereas the 2Hz stimulation increased false alarms for disgusted faces. This suggested a facilitatory effect of the 6Hz frequency on inhibitory control and a disinhibitory effect of the 2Hz frequency that enhanced impulsive responses. In Study 2, we assessed the heartbeat-evoked potentials as an index of heart-brain interaction and observed increased amplitude following 6Hz stimulation, suggesting enhanced cortical processing of cardiac signals. In Study 3, passive listening fMRI showed that the 6Hz stimulation selectively activated the left insula compared to the 2Hz condition. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that Sonoception exerts distinct effects on behavioral, physiological, and neural functions, supporting the hypothesis that auditory frequency-specific stimulation can modulate cognitive-emotional functions, brain-body interactions and insular activation patterns.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Everyday experience is rooted in the continuous interaction between external and internal information. Every sensation, perception, and emotion that enriches our daily life arises from the dynamic interplay between external stimuli, bodily states, and higher-order cognitive processes.</p><p>In this context, the insular cortex, originally identified as the central hub of interoceptive processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Craig 2002</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">, Craig 2003)</ref>, is now recognized as a core element that serves the integration between the external and internal landscapes that constitute our sense of self <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Craig 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">, Namkung, Kim et al. 2017)</ref>. Recently, the insula has been described as "an interface between sensation, emotion and cognition" <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">(Zhang, Deng et al. 2024)</ref>, mediating high-order cognitive processes such as emotion awareness <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">(Singer, Critchley et al. 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">, Gu, Hof et al. 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">, Seth 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">, Seth and Friston 2016</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">, Frot, Mauguière et al. 2022</ref>) and emotion recognition, particularly for emotions such as disgust <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">(Wicker, Keysers et al. 2003</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">, Papagno, Pisoni et al. 2016)</ref>, inhibitory control mechanisms implicated in impulsivity and salience processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Ghahremani, Rastogi et al. 2015)</ref>, as well as multisensory integration of bodily perceptions such as heartbeat, respiration, pain, and others <ref type="bibr">(Gogolla 2017</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">, Hassanpour, Simmons et al. 2018</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">, Salomon, Ronchi et al. 2018</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">, Chouchou, Mauguière et al. 2019</ref><ref type="bibr">, Labrakakis 2023)</ref>.</p><p>Although the left and right insula are often coactive across a broad range of processes, certain specific domains show partial lateralization. Specifically, disgust processing appears to involve the left insula more selectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">(Wicker, Keysers et al. 2003</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">, Papagno, Pisoni et al. 2016)</ref>, while other emotions, such as anger, tend to be less lateralized <ref type="bibr">(Mazzola, Arciero et al. 2016, Seok and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Cheong 2019)</ref>. The insular cortex is also related to control inhibition and impulsivity, and to the processing of conflict and interference <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Ghahremani, Rastogi et al. 2015)</ref>. Evidence from Go/No-go (G/NG) tasks found consistent activation of the insular cortex during failures of behavioral inhibition <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Dambacher, Sack et al. 2015)</ref>, interference processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Menon, Adleman et al. 2001)</ref>, and inhibitory control <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Happer, Wagner et al. 2021</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">, Cortese, Vatrano et al. 2022)</ref>. Interestingly, a metaanalysis of 66 fMRI studies showed that only the left insula was consistently activated across all the inhibitory domains assessed via G/NG tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Hung, Gaillard et al. 2018</ref>).</p><p>The insula is also one of the main sources of the heartbeat-evoked potential (HEP), an eventrelated potential time-locked to the heartbeat that reflects cortical processing of cardiac signals <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Kern, Aertsen et al. 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">, Babo-Rebelo, Wolpert et al. 2016</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">, Babo-Rebelo, Buot et al. 2019)</ref>.</p><p>Numerous studies have established a link between the amplitude of the HEP and attention to cardiac sensations, accuracy in perceiving cardiac signals, and emotional arousal <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Luft and Bhattacharya 2015</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">, García-Cordero, Esteves et al. 2017</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">, Mai, Wong et al. 2018</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">, Petzschner, Weber et al. 2019)</ref>.</p><p>Notably, recent investigations have revealed alterations in HEP amplitude following exposure to sounds associated with disgust <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Kato, Takei et al. 2020)</ref>. This phenomenon was accompanied by heightened insular activity, consistent with prior research that underscores the intricate connection between the perception of disgust and activation of insular cortex <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">(Wicker, Keysers et al. 2003</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">, Wright, He et al. 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">, Vytal and Hamann 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">, Papagno, Pisoni et al. 2016)</ref>.</p><p>In his seminal works, Craig highlighted that the insular cortex was also capable of processing auditory stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Craig 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">, Craig 2010)</ref>, referring to an experimental study that reported asymmetric and bilateral insular activation in response to different synthetic auditory frequencies <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Ackermann, Riecker et al. 2001)</ref>. In their study, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Ackermann, Riecker et al. (2001)</ref> identified two separate frequencies that, in addition to other temporal and frontal areas, were selectively processed by either the left or the right insula. Specifically, a 6Hz synthetic sound frequency preferentially activated the left insula, whereas a 2Hz synthetic sound frequency preferentially activated the right one, with a partial overlapping activation of the left insula as well.</p><p>Their interpretation aligned with the hypothesis that the insula also contributes to spectrotemporal filtering of auditory signals in a lateralized manner, consistent with the "double filtering by frequency" model <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Bamiou, Musiek et al. 2003)</ref>. According to the theory, in support of language auditory perception, the left insula functions as a high-pass filter, selectively enhancing rapid acoustic transients such as consonants, whereas the right insula serves as a low-pass filter, preferentially processing slower temporal fluctuations such as prosody <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Ackermann, Riecker et al. 2001, Ackermann and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Riecker 2004)</ref>. In recent years, accumulating evidence from neuroimaging, lesion studies, and intracranial recordings converges to implicate the insula in processes ranging from low-level acoustic feature encoding <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">(Zhang, Zhou et al. 2019</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">, Berger, Kawasaki et al. 2025</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">, Christison-Lagay, Khalaf et al. 2025</ref>) to high-level salience attribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Blenkmann, Collavini et al. 2019)</ref>, language perception and comprehension <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(Remedios, Logothetis et al. 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">, Oh, Duerden et al. 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">, Protas 2018</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">, Nourski, Steinschneider et al. 2022</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b108">, Zhang, Zhou et al. 2022)</ref>, and multisensory audio-visual integration <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Herdener, Lehmann et al. 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">, Renier, Anurova et al. 2009</ref><ref type="bibr">, Gogolla 2017)</ref>. Surprisingly, the seminal findings demonstrating lateralized activation of the left and right insula in response to sounds have not been replicated to date, nor have the potential behavioral and physiological correlates of such lateralized stimulation been systematically investigated.</p><p>The present work aims at investigating whether non-invasive synthetic sound stimulation can influence processing not only in terms of insula activation, as originally reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Ackermann, Riecker et al. (2001)</ref>, but also in terms of measurable shifts at behavioral and cortical levels. We hypothesize that synthetic sound stimulation might elicit asymmetrical effects on different behavioral, physiological, and neural processes preferentially related to insular cortex, from emotional recognition and control inhibition to cortical processing of cardiac signals. We define this methodology as Sonoception <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Riva, Serino et al. 2017</ref>) and presents the concept of auditory Sonoceptive priming -namely using synthetic auditory stimulation to modulate the processing of subsequent stimuli presented after the stimulation.</p><p>We conducted three separate studies aimed at assessing the effects of the auditory stimulation in healthy participants on emotional processing and inhibitory control, cortical processing of cardiac signals, and insular cortex activation. In Study 1, we used an emotional G/NG task involving disgusted and neutral facial expressions to assess the effects of sonoceptive stimulation on emotion discrimination, response inhibition, conflict, and interference processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">(Tottenham, Hare et al. 2011)</ref>. We selected faces expressing disgust as the left insula preferentially processes this emotion <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Papagno, Pisoni et al. 2016)</ref>. In Study 2, we verified the ability of sonoceptive stimulation to alter the processing of cardiac information at the cortical level by assessing HEPs amplitude <ref type="bibr">(Park and</ref><ref type="bibr">Blanke 2019, Coll, Hobson et al. 2021)</ref>. In Study 3, we sought to replicate the results from <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Ackermann, Riecker et al. (2001)</ref> using passive listening fMRI to confirm that the sonoceptive stimulation activates the insular cortex. Firstly, we expected that the 6Hz auditory stimulation would promote inhibitory control, suppressing inadequate motor response during high-arousal interference contexts, possibly impairing emotion recognition processing for disgusted faces, as suggested by previous literature on left insula direct electrical stimulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Papagno, Pisoni et al. 2016)</ref>. Conversely, we predicted that the 2Hz stimulation would have an opposite effect, impairing motor inhibition control and fostering impulsive response for faces expressing disgust. Secondly, we expected an effect of the auditory stimulation on HEPs amplitude, yet we did not formulate specific predictions regarding the lateralization of the two synthetic frequency, as the existing findings on the relationship between the left and right insula and the HEP are inconsistent <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Park, Bernasconi et al. 2016</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">, Park, Bernasconi et al. 2018</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">, Babo-Rebelo, Buot et al. 2019)</ref>. Lastly, we expected to replicate previous fMRI results from <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Ackermann, Riecker et al. (2001)</ref>, confirming that the synthetic auditory frequencies can activate the insular cortices in a lateralized manner.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Overview</head><p>In Study 1, participants performed an emotional G/NG task with neutral and disgust emotions. The task was repeated three times, at baseline, after the sonoceptive 2Hz stimulation, and after the sonoceptive 6Hz stimulation. The order of the stimulation was counterbalanced, and autonomic (heart rate variability-HRV and galvanic skin response-GSR) data were collected throughout the baseline and the stimulation conditions to control that observed differences in behavioral task among conditions were not explained by changes in physiology.</p><p>Forty-four healthy volunteers with normal or corrected-to-normal vision and no hearing impairments (40 females; mean age = 21.54, SD = 4.87 years old, 40 right-handed) were recruited via the SONA system at Royal Holloway University of London. Inclusion criteria were: no personal/familiar history of neuro-psychiatric, cardiovascular, and/or respiratory disorders; not currently pregnant; no alcohol/drugs taken 24h prior to the experiment or coffee taken 2h prior the experiment. The sample size was estimated based on previous research employing G/NG paradigms <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">(Tottenham, Hare et al. 2011)</ref>. The research was approved by the University's Ethical Committee at Royal Holloway University of London. Eligible participants were given oral and written explanations about the study procedure. All participants gave written informed consent and received £5 as compensation for their time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Ackermann, Riecker et al. 2001)</ref>, a series of isochronous trains of synthetic clicks were created with Audacity® (audacityteam.org). Starting from a single synthetic generated click noise (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1B</ref>), the original sample was cloned in several train series. Each series was 6s long, each track included 15 trials per frequency in a counter-balanced order. The onset-to-onset intervals between activation and rest epochs randomly varied between 12s and 24s. The auditory stimuli were applied via headphones simultaneously to both ears, volume was then adjusted to a comfortable level and each participant gave oral confirmation of clearly hearing the stimulation.</p><p>Participants were instructed to passively listen to the acoustic stimuli and to refrain from any motor or cognitive responses such as finger lifting and silent or overt counting. Sonoception audio files are available at OSF material repository (https://osf.io/u5aw3/).  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Emotional Go/No-go task</head><p>The emotional G/NG task <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">(Tottenham, Hare et al. 2011</ref>) is a variation of the standard G/NG task.</p><p>The task assesses participants' ability to withhold prepotent behavioral responses (cognitive control) in the context of potentially interfering emotional information (emotion regulation).</p><p>Additionally, the task assesses the ability to discriminate the emotionally relevant stimuli with speed and accuracy (emotion discrimination), which serves both the cognitive control and the emotion regulation processes. For the task, 120 images of neutral and disgusted facial expressions from the FACES database (half males, half neutral) <ref type="bibr">(Ebner et al. 2010)</ref> were used. We selected faces expressing disgust due to a cortical asymmetry that indicates how the left insula preferentially processes disgust <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Papagno, Pisoni et al. 2016)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Behavioural paradigm</head><p>Participants sat comfortably in an armchair, received information regarding the study, and were invited to sign a consent form. Participants were then connected to a 3-lead ECG and 2-lead GSR recorder and invited to rest for 2 minutes before recording the physiological baseline for 5 minutes.</p><p>After the baseline, participants started the G/NG task. Stimuli were presented on a computer screen.</p><p>Participants were asked to press a keyboard as they saw a specific emotion indicated by the instructions. The experiment entailed three iterations of the G/NG task: baseline, post 6Hz stimulation, and post 2Hz stimulation. Each iteration of the task consisted of two conditions: in one condition, participants were instructed to respond as quickly as possible with a key-press only to neutral faces (Go stimuli) and ignore disgust faces (No-go stimuli); in the other one, participants had to respond to disgust faces (Go stimuli) and ignore the neutral faces (No-go stimuli). Each condition consisted of 40 trials (70% Go trials, to invoke a prepotent tendency for a Go response) Procedure (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>). The study always began with the baseline run of the task. Next, participants were invited to wear commercial-grade headphones and to adjust the audio volume to a comfortable level.</p><p>Participants then underwent auditory stimulation (either 2Hz or 6Hz) for 5 minutes followed by another run of the task. The procedure was repeated for the counterbalanced stimulation. The order of the task conditions (Go neutral and Go disgust) was counterbalanced between runs and participants. The order of the stimulation (2Hz or 6Hz) was also counterbalanced. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Physiological measures</head><p>Cardiac activity (ECG) and GSR were recorded throughout the study. To record participants' ECG, two electrodes were attached under the left and right clavicle and one on the left lower back, within the ribcage frame. The ECG signal was recorded using a Powerlab 8/35 box (Bio Amp 132, ADInstruments Pty Ltd, Bella Vista, New South Wales, Australia) and LabChart software (v8.1, https://www.adinstruments.com).

Pressing the key for disgusted faces will therefore result in a false alarm. False alarms are a measure of impulsive behavior. Specifically, false alarm scores for neutral No-go trials are a proxy of cognitive control -namely a reduced ability to inhibit a prepotent behavioral response in the context of neutral information.

Post-hoc analyses for the interaction between condition and emotion revealed that for the disgust emotion (i.e., motor inhibition during neutral faces, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>, left panel), the false alarms in the 6Hz condition (Mean = 0.878, SE = 0.187) were significantly lower than the baseline condition (Mean difference = 0.674, SE = 0.229, t(215) = 2.94, p = .011).

Post-hoc analyses for the main effect of condition showed that the difference between 6Hz and baseline and the difference between 2Hz and baseline were not significant. However, the difference between 6Hz and 2Hz was significant (t(224) = -3.80, p = .001). The plot for the main effect of condition is reported in the Supplementary material (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). Post-hoc analyses for the main effect of order indicated lower false alarm rate when 6Hz was presented first (Order 1, Mean = 1.08, SE = 0.123) than after 2Hz (Order 2, Mean = 1.44, SE = 0.112) (t(225) = -2.713, p = .007).

Specifically, the 6Hz stimulation enhanced cognitive inhibitory control, as evidenced by a reduced false alarm rate when participants were presented with neutral faces in the Go-disgust condition. This result aligns with existing literature proposing a key role of the left insula in inhibitory control <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Hung, Gaillard et al. 2018</ref>) and may be interpreted as an attenuation of the salience of stimuli in high-arousal contexts characterized by the interference of emotional stimuli.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Interim discussion</head><p>potentially due to an enhancement of the immediate arousal response and behavioral relevance of highly emotional stimuli that impaired emotion regulation. This may have led to a reduced ability to inhibit a prepotent behavioral response in the context of emotional information <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">(Tottenham, Hare et al. 2011)</ref>. The absence of significant effects in both the miss rate and GoRT among conditions suggests that the observed differences are not merely a reflection of attentional mechanisms or diminished accuracy in the discrimination of the emotional faces <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Frot, Mauguière et al. 2022</ref>).</p><p>Instead, it might indicate that the two stimulations might modulate the neural pathways associated with emotion regulation and control inhibition differently. The 2Hz stimulation could enhance the perceptual saliency of emotional stimuli (disgust), making participants more likely to fail motor response inhibition. On the other hand, the 6Hz stimulation might promote the opposite mechanism, enhancing inhibitory control by possibly reducing the priming effect of high saliency emotional stimuli aimed at interfering with the discrimination of neutral faces. In this regard, the sonoceptive stimulation seems to play a role in the balance between the salience of primed emotional cues and inhibitory control processes. When focusing on the main effect of the order of sonoceptive stimulation, results indicated that the 2Hz stimulation resulted in an overall higher false alarm rate across conditions when played before the 6Hz, suggesting a long-lasting carryover effect of the 2Hz stimulation that contrasted with the facilitating effect of the 6Hz stimulation in terms of inhibitory control.</p><p>On the physiological level, GSR revealed a significant reduction in sympathetic arousal following both the 2Hz and 6Hz stimulations compared to baseline but no differences between the two stimulation conditions. Similarly, several broad HRV indices, including SDNN, as well as HF and LF power, showed no significant effects of the stimulation. This lack of a widespread impact suggests that the sonoceptive stimulation's influence on behavior was not merely a byproduct of a generalized shift in autonomic tone, but rather suggests that the divergent behavioral outcomes, i.e., the enhancement of inhibitory control and the promotion of impulsivity might be attributable to more specific, higher-order modulation. Lastly, the significant interaction between stimulation condition and presentation order for both RMSSD, a marker of parasympathetic vagal tone, and HR itself, aligns with the carryover effects observed in the behavioral data and the main effect of order on the LF/HF ratio further substantiates this interpretation.</p><p>In conclusion, the findings from the G/NG task in Study 1 indicate that sonoceptive stimulation can specifically modulate higher-order functions like inhibitory control, possibly via a central modulation pathway. To further explore the possibility of central processing modulation and given the insula's central role in the processing of cardiac signals, an EEG study was conducted to further investigate the relationship between auditory stimulation and cortical processing of heart-brain interaction, as indexed by the HEP.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Linear mixed-effects models</head><p>To statistically evaluate the effects of condition order and duration on HEP amplitude, we entered single-trial HEP values into a linear mixed-effects model comprising 25,066 trials, clustered around 18 participants. Single-trial HEP activity was calculated by averaging the voltage of the significant channels and time-window of observed HEP effects. Values lying outside three standard deviations from the mean were labeled as outliers and consequently excluded. Models were implemented using the general analyses for the linear model (GAMLj) module in jamovi (v2.3.21; The jamovi project 2022), with the residual maximum likelihood method. We computed multiple models to predict HEP amplitude, starting with the simplest model and adding factors stepwise. The Akaike information criterion (AIC) was used to identify the best-fitting model. For each parameter in the best-fitting model, we reported the estimated coefficient (b), standard error (SE), t-statistic, and pvalue, with degrees of freedom estimated using Satterthwaite's method. Fixed factors included condition (baseline, post 2Hz and post 6Hz) and order (2Hz first and 6Hz first). To assess the role of task duration, we calculated the relative latency as a covariate, defined as the latency (in seconds) of each R-peak in relation to the beginning of each specific condition. In these models, we examined the interactions between condition × order and condition × latency. When a significant interaction was found, post-hoc analyses were conducted separately for each condition and corrected for multiple comparisons using the Tukey method.</p></div>

First, we performed a cluster-based permutation t-test comparing HEPs during the baseline condition with those after 2Hz auditory stimulation. This analysis revealed no significant differences in any cortical cluster for either the early (t(17) = -1.97, p = .57, d = -0.465) or late time windows (t(17) = 0.848, p = .232, d = 0.199) (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>). We then compared baseline HEPs with those obtained after 6Hz auditory stimulation. During a window from 66 to 309 ms post-R-peak (early time-window), HEP negativity was enhanced in the post 6Hz condition over a central-right cluster of electrodes (FCz, Cz, CPz, C4, C2, CP2, CP4, CP6, P2, and P4), with peaks at Cz, CPz, and C2 (t(17) = -3.743, p = .035, d = 0.882) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">4A,</ref><ref type="figure">B</ref>).

Source reconstruction with sLORETA indicated that HEP amplitude was significantly more negative in the post-6Hz condition than in baseline, particularly in postero-central cortical areas primarily involving the sensorimotor network (bilateral post-central, paracentral, and pre-central gyri) (t(17) = -3.103, p &lt; .005, d = -0.731) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">4C</ref>). No significant HEP differences were found between conditions in the late time window (t(17) = 0.821, p = .99, d = 0.194). We did not observe significant HEP amplitude changes when contrasting the post 6Hz with post 2Hz condition in either the early (t(17) = -2.312, p = .965, d = -0.545) or late (t(17) = 0.264, p = 1, d = 0.062) time windows. We also analyzed whether HEPs differed between baseline and each auditory stimulation period (stim 2Hz and stim 6Hz). As expected, we found no significant differences across comparisons (early time window: stim 6Hz vs. baseline (t( <ref type="formula">17</ref> and stim 6Hz vs. stim 2Hz (t(17) = -1.004, p = .351, d = -0.237); see Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3A,</ref><ref type="figure">B</ref>).</p><p>To determine whether changes in HEP activity were associated with peripheral changes in cardiac or respiratory physiology across conditions, we examined participants' cardiorespiratory features (breathing rate, HR, SDNN, RMSSD, HRV, HF, LF, and LF/HF) using repeated-measures ANOVAs. No significant differences emerged across conditions (see Supplementary materials, Supplementary Table <ref type="table">3</ref>). To assess changes in cardiac physiology, we conducted two-tailed paired t-tests on the average ECG amplitude at each time-point within the significant HEP window (66-309 ms), followed by FDR correction. No significant differences in ECG amplitude were observed between conditions (baseline vs. post 6Hz: t(19) = 1.94, p = .102, d = 0.435) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">4D</ref>). In sum, these analyses suggest that the observed differences in HEP activity between conditions are not attributable to cardiorespiratory physiological changes, but rather to changes in cardiac interoception at the cortical level. To further assess the role of auditory stimulation duration (i.e., relative latency) and order on HEP amplitude, we performed additional analyses using linear mixed-effects models. The best fitting model was:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">𝐻𝐸𝑃 ∼ 1 + 𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 + 𝑜𝑟𝑑𝑒𝑟 + 𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛: 𝑜𝑟𝑑𝑒𝑟 + (1|𝐼𝐷)</formula><p>The model reported a significant effect of the intercept (b = -0.08, SE = 0.037, t = -2.195, p = .043) and of condition (not reported), which was trivial considering that HEPs were averaged over the previously significant cluster. Importantly, the model also showed a significant interaction between order and condition (post 2Hz vs. baseline: b = -0.091, SE = 0.033, t = -2.765, p = .006; post 6Hz vs. baseline: b = -0.07, SE = 0.033, t = -2.125, p = .034). No significant effects were found for relative latency, nor for its interactions with condition. Post-hoc analyses revealed a significant increase in negativity for the post 6Hz vs. baseline (z = 4.578, p &lt; .001) and post 2Hz vs. baseline comparisons (z = 4.332, p &lt; .001), but only when the 6Hz condition was presented first. A trend toward increased HEP negativity was observed for the post 6Hz vs. baseline comparison when the 2Hz condition was presented first. However, this did not survive correction for multiple comparisons (z = 2.12, p = .277). No other post-hoc comparisons were significant (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">4E</ref>).

Control analyses confirmed that differences in HEP activity between conditions cannot be attributed to shifts in cardiorespiratory physiology, but they appear to be linked to cortical processing of cardiac interoceptive signals. This suggests that 6Hz sonoceptive stimulation may enhance heart-brain interactions. Conversely, auditory stimulation at 2Hz did not induce significant increases in HEP negativity. As expected, no significant effect was observed when comparing the auditory stimulation phases (stim 6Hz and stim 2Hz) with the baseline, suggesting that the effects of the stimulation emerge gradually over time. Notably, single-trial mixed-effects model analysis revealed that, as in Study 1, the order of presentation of the auditory stimulations strongly influenced differences in HEP amplitude among post 2Hz, post 6Hz, and baseline conditions.

In contrast, 6Hz stimulation is robust enough to sustain high HEP negativity even after subsequent 2Hz stimulation, with 2Hz stimulation being associated to higher HEP negativity compared to baseline only when following 6Hz stimulation. This suggests a sustained carryover effect of both stimulations (facilitatory in the case of 6Hz and suppressive for 2Hz) on cardiac interoception. It is noteworthy that the insular cortex has been previously implicated in HEP generation <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Canales-Johnson, Silva et al. 2015</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">, Babo-Rebelo, Wolpert et al. 2016</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">, Babo-Rebelo, Buot et al. 2019</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">, Park and Blanke 2019)</ref>. Given the association of 6Hz auditory stimulation with left insular activation <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Ackermann, Riecker et al. 2001)</ref>, our findings suggest that synthetic auditory stimulation with 6Hz sounds may amplify HEP activity via left insular engagement. This interpretation is partially supported by intracranial EEG evidence in the literature: electrodes implanted in the left insular cortex demonstrated differential HEP modulation between two experimental conditions in a full-body illusion paradigm, where the synchronous stroking condition elicited greater HEP modulation in the left insula compared to the asynchronous condition <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Park, Bernasconi et al. 2018</ref>). However, literature on the contributions of the left versus right insula to the HEP remains inconsistent. In this regard, the lack of significant HEP response to the 2Hz auditory stimulation may suggest that cortical processing of cardiac information under conditions of low arousal (i.e., passive listening) could be more closely associated with left insular processing. Due to the spatial limitations inherent in EEG, an additional fMRI study was conducted to validate the direct relationship auditory stimulation and insular activity.</p><p>Sonoceptive stimulation was performed as in Studies 1 and 2.</p><p>In the MRI scanner, a 6-min resting-state scan (run 1) took place first, during which participants were instructed to rest with their eyes open (without thinking of anything in particular) and not to fall asleep. During the resting-state scan, a white fixation cross was presented in the center of a homogenous gray background. Subsequently, a structural scan was obtained. Next, participants completed two rounds of scans (6 minutes each) while passively listening to sounds (runs 2 and 3; auditory stimulation at 6Hz and 2Hz, in counterbalanced order). Auditory stimuli were applied via headphones simultaneously to both ears and were well discernible at a comfortable loudness level against the background of scanner noise, as confirmed by each participant. Each auditory stimulation run comprised 15 click trains of sounds. Participants were instructed to passively listen to the acoustic stimuli with their eyes open and fixed on the fixation cross and to strictly refrain from any motor or cognitive responses. The onset-to-onset intervals between the click trains varied randomly between 12 and 24 s (jittered interspersed gaps) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Ackermann et al., 2001)</ref>. The single click trains lasted for approximately 6s. The total time spent in the scanner by each participant did not exceed 60 min.</p></div>

There were two different analyses: (1) simple main effect of each auditory stimulation condition and (2) a difference between conditions (6Hz vs. 2Hz). For the main effects analysis, the one-sample t-test was performed to identify activations evoked by sounds (vs. implicit baseline). To identify brain regions differentially recruited between 6Hz and 2Hz auditory stimulation conditions, a secondlevel (group level) whole brain voxel-wise GLM was conducted across participants. As we had a strong hypothesis regarding between-auditory stimulation differences within the insula, we conducted a separate region of interest (ROI) analysis, were we used bilateral insula mask as defined in the Harvard-Oxford cortical probabilistic atlas <ref type="bibr">(Desikan et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr">Frazier et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr">Makris et al., 2006)</ref> thresholded at 95%.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MRI auditory stimulation</head><p>For the main effect of the auditory stimulation vs. baseline, both frequencies (6Hz and 2Hz), evoked bilateral (posterior) insular activations, alongside robust activations in temporal regions Auditory stimulation data analysis (bilateral planum temporale, primary and secondary auditory cortices, middle and superior temporal gyri), frontal areas (bilateral inferior frontal gyri, frontal pole, frontal operculum), and cerebellar cortices. The 6Hz auditory stimulation also evoked activations within subcortical areas (caudate, putamen, pallidum), while the 2Hz stimulation also activated the right precentral gyrus and brain stem (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">5A,</ref><ref type="figure">B</ref>).These results largely replicate previous findings showing that passive listening to click trains (2Hz and 6Hz) elicits hemodynamic activation in several structures outside the central-auditory pathways including the insular cortices <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Ackermann, Riecker et al. 2001)</ref>. The contrast between auditory stimulation conditions (6Hz vs. 2Hz) revealed that the 6Hz frequency evoked greater activation in the bilateral Herschl's gyrus (encompassing primary and secondary somatosensory cortices). However, the changes did not extend into insular cortex (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">5C</ref>).

There were no suprathreshold differences for the reversed contrast.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General discussion</head><p>In the present study, we tested a non-invasive technique called Sonoception that utilizes synthetic auditory stimulation to modulate behavioral, physiological, and neural responses in healthy participants.</p><p>Following preliminary fMRI evidence from of <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Ackermann, Riecker et al. (2001)</ref>, we designed two sequencies of artificial train click noises, at prespecified frequencies. These auditory stimulations were previously shown to be able to activate the insular cortex asymmetrically, where a 6Hz synthetic audio stimulation was able to preferentially active the left insula, while a 2Hz synthetic audio stimulation was able to preferentially activate the right insula. We therefore sought to understand if this synthetic auditory stimulation could also modulate various levels of human processing related in literature to the insula activity such as emotion discrimination, inhibitory control, impulsivity, and cardiac heart-brain interaction. Specifically, we expected 6Hz stimulation to enhance inhibitory control of emotionally salient stimuli, and 2Hz to impair motor inhibition and increase impulsivity. Additionally, we explored whether auditory stimulation modulated cortical processing of heart-brain interactions, as indexed by HEP amplitude, though no frequencyspecific predictions were made due to inconsistent findings on insular lateralization in cardiac interoception. Lastly, we sought to replicate previous fMRI results from <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Ackermann, Riecker et al. (2001)</ref> demonstrating frequency-specific insular activations.</p><p>Study 1 confirmed that Sonoception modulates inhibitory control in emotionally salient contexts. The 6Hz stimulation enhanced response inhibition, reflected by reduced false alarms to neutral faces. Conversely, 2Hz stimulation increased false alarms to disgusted faces. These results align with the literature supporting a dominant role of the left insula in inhibitory control at cognitive, motor, and emotional level <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Hung, Gaillard et al. 2018)</ref>, and it is suggestive that the 6Hz auditory stimulation was able to diminish the salience in contexts characterized by the interference of high-arousal emotional stimuli. Conversely, the 2Hz stimulation, was able to inhibit a prepotent behavioral response in the context of emotional information <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">(Tottenham, Hare et al. 2011)</ref>, enhancing impulsive responses. This finding, on the other hand, might be interpreted as a failure of inhibitory control <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Dambacher, Sack et al. 2015)</ref> due to an enhancement of the immediate arousal value and behavioral relevance of highly emotional stimuli. Interestingly, the absence of significant differences in both the missing number and Go response times suggests that the observed effects did not reflect changes in attentional or emotional discrimination processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Frot, Mauguière et al. 2022)</ref>. Moreover, the results on physiological measures indicated that the observed effects could not be attributed to increased autonomic or physiological arousal that might have confounded inhibitory control responses. Notably, despite counterbalancing, we observed a robust carryover effect: 2Hz auditory stimulation preceding 6Hz led to an overall increase in false alarms, indicating a disruptive effect on inhibitory control. This suggests that 2Hz not only elicits impulsivity but may interfere with the facilitatory effects of subsequent 6Hz stimulation.</p><p>Study 2 extended these findings to heart-brain dynamics. The 6Hz stimulation enhanced HEP negativity over central-right electrodes immediately post-stimulation, independently of changes in cardiorespiratory physiology, suggesting that passive exposure to 6Hz sound stimulation has the potential to enhance the cortical processing of cardiac signals. In contrast, 2Hz</p><p>stimulation not only failed to increase HEP amplitude when presented first but also showed a suppressive carryover effect to subsequent 6Hz stimulation. These results mirror the behavioural findings from Study 1, confirming the effects of stimulation frequency on heart-brain interaction.</p><p>Given the established link between insular activity and HEP generation <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Canales-Johnson, Silva et al. 2015</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">, Babo-Rebelo, Wolpert et al. 2016</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">, Babo-Rebelo, Buot et al. 2019</ref>) and the association of 6Hz stimulation with left insular activation <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Ackermann, Riecker et al. 2001)</ref> we propose that the modulation of HEP amplitude is likely mediated by left insular engagement. However, the precise lateralization of insular contributions to cardiac cortical processing remains to be determined.</p><p>Study 3 partially replicated the fMRI findings of <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Ackermann, Riecker et al. (2001)</ref>. While our paradigm did not employ a parametric design, passive listening to 2Hz and 6Hz click trains elicited hemodynamic responses in both central auditory pathways and the insular cortices. ROI analyses showed significantly greater activation in the left posterior insula during 6Hz relative to 2Hz stimulation, corroborating the behavioural and HEP findings. On the contrary, we did not observe greater right insular activation relative to the left in response to 2Hz stimulation, casting doubt on the efficacy of 2Hz as a right-lateralized insular modulator.</p><p>Taken together, these findings add to accumulating evidence positioning the insular cortex as a key hub for auditory perception. The posterior insula is known to be involved in early auditory processing, with activation patterns resembling those of primary auditory areas <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Berger, Kawasaki et al. 2025</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">, Christison-Lagay, Khalaf et al. 2025)</ref>, likely via direct projections from the medial geniculate body and auditory cortices <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Mesulam and Mufson 1982</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">, Augustine 1996</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">, Cauda, D'agata et al. 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">, Takemoto, Hasegawa et al. 2014)</ref>. Nonetheless and more crucially, our findings demonstrate that Sonoception can not only activate the insula but also modulate higher-order functions that related in the literature to this specific area. The 6Hz stimulation emerged as the most effective protocol for enhancing inhibitory control and cardiac interoception. By contrast, 2Hz stimulation increased impulsivity and reduced heart-brain connectivity by exerting suppressive carryover effects on subsequent 6Hz stimulation. Collectively, these results suggest that 6Hz stimulation is a candidate for future interventions targeting self-regulation and interoceptive awareness.</p><p>The stronger involvement of the 6Hz auditory stimulation may also be related to the recruitment of additional neurophysiological pathways, particularly those mediated by the vestibular system. Vestibular-evoked myogenic potentials (VEMPs) reflect vestibular afferent activation and are preferentially elicited using 6Hz tone bursts <ref type="bibr">(Todd, Paillard et al. 2014, Jurado and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Marquardt 2020)</ref>. It is plausible that 6Hz Sonoception stimuli engaged vestibular pathways via this mechanism. Notably, the vestibular system maintains both structural and functional connections to the insular cortex, in particular at the level of the parieto-insular vestibular cortex (PIVC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Kirsch, Keeser et al. 2016)</ref>. In primates, the PIVC is a core node for vestibular processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Lopez and Blanke 2011)</ref>, and converging vestibular afferents from otolith organs and semicircular canals project to the retroinsular cortex, parietal operculum, and posterior insula <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Lopez, Blanke et al. 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Although preliminary, these converging lines of evidence suggest that both auditory and vestibular-insular pathways may contribute to the effects of 6Hz Sonoception. Future research is needed to delineate the relative contributions of these pathways and clarify the underlying mechanisms.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Overview</head><p>In Study 3, to verify that the sonoceptive stimulation was able to modulate insular activation, participants underwent passive listening fMRI scans. The scans were performed with three runs; baseline (resting-state), sonoceptive 2Hz stimulation, and sonoceptive 6Hz stimulation. The baseline condition was always performed first, while the order of presentation of the auditory stimulation conditions was counterbalanced across participants.</p><p>Thirty right-handed healthy volunteers with normal or corrected-to-normal vision and no hearing impairments (25 females; mean age = 21.9, SD = 3.52 years old) were recruited for the study. </p></div>			</div>
