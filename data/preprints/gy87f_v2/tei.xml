<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Organizations continually redraw their reporting lines, not only in large-scale reorganizations, but also in the everyday course of adapting to shifting work demands and changes in personnel. Each such adjustment raises a fundamental question: Where are managers needed? Implicit in this question is the assumption that formal supervision can, in some cases, be substituted for by other organizational features. Identifying the conditions under which managerial oversight is needed is central to understanding the evolution of formal structure in organizations.</p><p>In organizational theory, the search for where managerial capacity is needed has been enmeshed in the broader study of how formal structure evolves. Tracing back to the arrival of open-systems and contingency perspectives <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">(Thompson 1967;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Lawrence and Lorsch 1967)</ref>, research has focused on how different structural configurations address the uncertainties and constraints imposed by an organization's external environment. This stream of work highlights the influence of external factors such as market competition <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Hannan and Freeman 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Guadalupe and Wulf 2010)</ref>, resource munificence <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Aldrich 1979)</ref>, technological change <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(Mohr 1971)</ref>, and isomorphic pressures <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(DiMaggio and Powell 1983)</ref>. It conceptualizes formal structure as an organization-level characteristic, measuring its evolution in different environments through variables such as decision-making centralization <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(Mohr 1971;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Raveendran 2020)</ref>, spans of control <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Guadalupe and Wulf 2010)</ref>, and the complexity of grouping and linking structures <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Mintzberg 1989</ref>).</p><p>More recent work has challenged two assumptions in this line of work. First, some studies have argued and shown that formal structure can be shaped by internal factors independent of external ones <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(Nickerson and Zenger 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Gulati and Puranam 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Raveendran 2020</ref>).</p><p>This work focuses on how the efficacy of formal structure is influenced by elements of the "informal" organization-the emergent pattern of interactions and understandings among organizational members <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(McEvily et al. 2014)</ref>. Second, recent theory has adopted a "microstructural" lens that conceptualizes formal structure not only as an organization-level characteristic but also as instantiated through a variety of micro-level processes within or-ganizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">(Puranam 2018</ref>)-for example, how unit and team boundaries are set <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Clement and Puranam 2018)</ref>, how local coordination procedures are defined <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">(Stan and Puranam 2017)</ref>, and how pairs of individuals are brought together structurally through a shared formal reporting relationship <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">(Soda and Zaheer 2012)</ref>. Together, these conceptual developments open the door to understanding changes in formal structure through a more granular and time-varying lens and to more fully embracing the reality that structure does not only evolve through discontinuous and all-encompassing "reorganizations" between archetypal forms <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(Nickerson and Zenger 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Gulati and Puranam 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b113">Srivastava 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Raveendran 2020</ref>) but also through myriad, continuous shifts in local structure.</p><p>Building on this shift, we focus on how one of the most emergent and fluid properties of an organization's internal workings-the degree of cultural alignment that develops between a given pair of colleagues as they interact with each other and with others around thempredicts micro-level choices made by organizational designers about where to add or remove formal structure in the form of a shared supervisor between the two colleagues. Cultural alignment encompasses a variety of dimensions-for example, shared values, beliefs, and assumptions or even similar ways of dressing-that can be difficult to observe. Following past literature, we focus on one of its most tangible, observable, and consequential manifestations: the degree of linguistic alignment in employees' everyday communications (e.g., internal emails, Slack, text messages, and videoconferencing chats) <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Goldberg et al. 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b115">Srivastava et al. 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Kovacs and Kleinbaum 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Lu et al. 2023</ref>).</p><p>We begin with the premise that organizational designers, the set of managers whoperhaps in consultation with human resources staff and external advisors-make ongoing choices about who should report to whom as they respond to evolving task demands, employee arrivals and departures, and shifts in employee skills and working styles. Although such decisions also get made in the context of a large-scale restructuring, our focus is on the everyday evolution of the reporting structure. We assume that, although organizational designers' choices about the reporting structure can be influenced by political factors, they are primarily driven by a desire to improve operating performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Albert 2018)</ref>. Thus, we anticipate that organizational designers will tend to separate two colleagues from a common supervisor when the interpersonal linguistic alignment between them can effectively substitute for the supervisor's functions. Conversely, they will tend to insert a shared supervisor between colleagues when linguistic alignment is unlikely to substitute for, or might even complement, a shared supervisor's functions. 1   Prior research points to competing expectations about whether interpersonal linguistic alignment will substitute for or instead complement formal supervision. The prevailing perspective suggests that they are substitutes: Because shared values, beliefs, and norms enable people to better coordinate with one another <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">(Sørensen 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b124">Weber and Camerer 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b122">Van den Steen 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Koçak and Puranam 2022)</ref>, two linguistically aligned individualswhose alignment stems in part from values, beliefs, and norms they have in common-can coordinate efficiently even without the help of a common supervisor. But some prior work also suggests that culture, including that which manifests in the form of language, and structure can function as complements. For example, while linguistic alignment may allow two individuals to coordinate efficiently, their ability to successfully do so may depend on their ability to resolve potential ambiguities and competing interpretations about their required tasks and handoffs. Formal structure in the form of a supervisor who can adjudicate such differences and manage interfaces with external actors whose inputs are needed for task completion could then prove to be critical in unlocking the potential of linguistic alignment <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Lounamaa and March 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Knudsen and Srikanth 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Lix et al. 2022)</ref>.</p><p>We reconcile this tension by considering the role of coordinative complexity-a dyad-level construct that encapsulates the degree to which the tasks of two employees are interdependent with those of other employees. We focus on dyad-level coordinative complexity because it corresponds to micro-level choices about where to erect or dismantle formal structure in the form of a shared supervisor. When coordinative complexity is low, we argue that interpersonal linguistic alignment can effectively substitute for a shared supervisor. When coor-1 In our data, we are unable to observe the extent to which linguistic alignment actually functions as an effective complement to or substitute for formal supervision. Our theoretical argument focuses on the perceptions and beliefs of organizational designers and how they might influence their choices of where to add or remove supervisors in the reporting structure.</p><p>dinative complexity is high, however, linguistic alignment functions more as a complement:</p><p>Although linguistically aligned colleagues can coordinate effectively with each other, such alignment does little to resolve bottlenecks or conflicts involving third parties. In these cases, a supervisor plays a critical role in mitigating cross-cutting demands. Moreover, alignment between subordinates can enhance the value of supervision by freeing managers to devote attention to higher-order tasks-for example, prioritization and boundary spanning-that become especially salient as interdependencies become more complex. Building on this reasoning, we predict that the likelihood of linguistically aligned colleagues being placed under a shared supervisor increases with the coordinative complexity of their tasks.</p><p>We evaluate our theory using archival data on the evolving reporting structure and intraorganizational employee communications of a design firm. These data reveal considerable flux in reporting relationships: We observe 6,229 instances of change (i.e., formation or dissolution) in supervisory units over the six years of our observation period. The past several years have seen an explosion of research that uses language as a window into culture and how it evolves over time <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Askin and Mauskapf 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Garg et al. 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Bail et al. 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Lix et al. 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Burt and Reagans 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Gouvard et al. 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Banerjee et al. 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Aceves and Evans 2024)</ref>. Building on this burgeoning literature, we adapt the Interactional Language Use Model <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Goldberg et al. 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b115">Srivastava et al. 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Lu et al. 2023</ref>)-which has been used in prior research to assess individual-level cultural fit-to measure the degree of linguistic alignment at the dyadic level. We report results from models that predict which pairs of colleagues will be brought together under, versus pulled apart from, a shared supervisor based on the subordinates' degree of linguistic alignment and the coordinative complexity of the tasks they are engaged in. Although we cannot observe whether these shifts in supervisory capacity are actually performance enhancing or diluting, our results are consistent with our theorized mechanisms. Supplemental analyses show that the joint effects of coordinative complexity and interpersonal linguistic alignment are especially predictive of the evolution of reporting relationships when two colleagues are highly visible to the senior managers who are most likely to make these specific organizational redesign choices. We discuss the im-plications of our findings for research on organizational design, organizational culture, and the interrelationships between the two.</p></div>

Some of the most influential work on organizational design, which investigates the antecedents and consequences of formal structure, emerged from the open-systems perspective <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">(Thompson 1967;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Lawrence and Lorsch 1967)</ref> and structural contingency theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Galbraith 1973;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Drazin and Van de Ven 1985)</ref>.

Given this emphasis on organization-environment fit, the prevailing conception of formal structure in this literature is as an organizational-level construct that can be characterized along such dimensions as size, degree of formalization, and centralization <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Miles and Snow 1978)</ref>. This approach can help explain heterogeneity and change in many of an organization's most readily observed structural features-for example, whether it is organized by function or instead by division <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Mintzberg 1989)</ref>.</p><p>More recent years have seen the development of a complementary "microstructural" approach that focuses attention on the less visible features of an organization. With intellectual roots in the behavioral theory of the firm <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">(Simon 1947;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Cyert and March 1963)</ref> and complex adaptive systems (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Herbert et al. 1962;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Miller and Page 2009)</ref>, this alternative approach is based on the principle of disaggregation and reaggregation <ref type="bibr">(Puranam 2018, 3</ref>): It conceptualizes large, complex organizations as collections of smaller entities such as dyads or subgroups that have simple recurring patterns, which are both affected by and shape organization-level phenomena. The emphasis is less on how formal structure helps organizations adapt to external pressures and more on its role in facilitating an effective division of labor and integration of effort inside organizations (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Puranam et al. 2012)</ref>. This line of work covers the spectrum from studies of organizational redesign to punctuated, large-scale "reorganizations" <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">(Raveendran 2020)</ref> to analyses of more frequent, local design changes that affect an organization's functioning without upending its overall design architecture <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Alexy et al. 2021)</ref>.</p><p>Research in the "microstructural" tradition encompasses both qualitative and quantitative studies. Examples of the former include ethnographic accounts of the interplay between technology and structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Barley 1986</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Barley , 1990;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Galunic and Eisenhardt 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Brown and Eisenhardt 1997)</ref> and the design of teams and multi-team systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Okhuysen and Bechky 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b121">Valentine and Edmondson 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Retelny et al. 2014)</ref>.

Thus, just as social relationships can be mapped between any pair of individuals, so can their connections to each other within formal structure-for example, through common incentives <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">(Puranam et al. 2012)</ref>, co-location <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Lee 2019)</ref>, or, as in our conceptualization, by having a common supervisor <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">(Soda and Zaheer 2012)</ref>.</p><p>In all of these disparate research traditions, a fundamental imperative for organizational design is to facilitate the coordination of tasks between individuals.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Coordination Through Structure and Culture</head><p>Embracing this microstructural view, we investigate how a micro-level aspect of informal organization-the degree of cultural alignment between two individuals-affects the evolution of an elemental manifestation of formal structure-the placement of two individuals under the supervision of a common superior. These two disparate constructs have some common features: They are both micro-level constructs that prior research has shown to be related to higher-level organizational processes and outcomes. For example, prior research has linked interpersonal cultural alignment, as it manifests in language, to such individuallevel outcomes as promotion, retention, and performance rewards <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Goldberg et al. 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b115">Srivastava et al. 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Lu et al. 2023)</ref>. Meanwhile, reporting relationships are the basis for most representations of hierarchical decision-making inside organizations and underlie much of their ability to help resolve conflicts and facilitate coordination <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">(Puranam 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Albert 2024</ref>).</p><p>Our argument is rooted in the notion that organizational designers, the set of managers who-perhaps in consultation with human resources professionals or other advisors-are responsible for determining who should report to whom, do so with the goal of facilitating effective interpersonal coordination <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Ethiraj and Levinthal 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Clement and Puranam 2018)</ref>. The factors that lead organizational designers to rewire reporting relationships include proactive planning (e.g., putting two individuals under the same supervisor based on the expectation that it will facilitate coordination) and trial-and-error learning (e.g., removing two individuals from common supervision after one or both receives negative performance feedback). Although planning and learning processes are often imperfect, we assume that-on average and holding constant extraneous factors 2 -these processes allow 2 Choices about formal structure are sometimes made for non-economic reasons such as individual status enhancement or the management of personality conflicts. Nevertheless, we assume that organizational designers are generally aiming to improve organizational effectiveness and will tend to do so either through forward-looking planning or through trial-and-error learning.</p><p>designers to progressively discover new ways of deploying formal supervision that benefit their organization.</p><p>In other words, we assume that, all else equal, organizational designers will assign a common supervisor to culturally aligned individuals when doing so will improve their ability to coordinate with each other. Yet prior research provides conflicting expectations as to whether organizations will benefit from placing culturally similar members under a shared supervisor. To identify the conditions under which the benefits will tend to outweigh the costs, we first describe the various mechanisms through which supervisors affect the coordination of their subordinates, then discuss how cultural similarity may substitute for some but not all of these roles, and then derive a hypothesis about how coordinative complexity moderates the effect of interpersonal cultural similarity on the likelihood that organizational designers will place two colleagues under a shared supervisor.</p><p>Although supervisors engage in a variety of coordinating activities <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Galbraith 1973)</ref>, these activities broadly fall into three categories. First, supervisors support interpersonal coordination between their subordinates by facilitating information sharing. This enables subordinates to better anticipate and predict each other's task requirements and actions <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Mintzberg 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Edmondson et al. 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b120">Valentine 2018)</ref>. It also reduces the impact of interpersonal conflicts, which can be better anticipated before they occur or more quickly resolved when they do erupt <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">(Puranam and Swamy 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Keum and See 2017)</ref>. Second, supervisors help prioritize and sequence the work of their subordinates, thereby helping individuals focus their effort on where it will be most valuable <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">(Raveendran et al. 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Ketkar and Workiewicz 2022)</ref>. Third, supervisors help subordinates align their goals and activities with those of stakeholders elsewhere in the organization or outside the organization by serving as a bridge between the internal unit and external actors <ref type="bibr" target="#b127">(Zhang 2023)</ref>.</p><p>Whether or not two individuals are connected via a shared supervisor, their likelihood of collaborating effectively with one another also depends on the extent to which they are culturally aligned. By culture, we mean the taken-for-granted, shared understandings that exist among organizational members-including their deeply rooted beliefs and assumptions about the world, as well as the norms that guide their behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">(Pettigrew 1979;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">DiMaggio 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Schein 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Patterson 2014)</ref>. Culture manifests at multiple levels in organizationsfor example, one can characterize the values, beliefs, and norms that prevail in the organization as a whole or across departments and geographies <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Chatman and O'Reilly 2016</ref>). Here we focus on a more elemental form of culture-that which emerges between individuals as they interact with one another or others around them. Consistent with our microfoundational lens on formal structure, we similarly focus on cultural alignment at the interpersonal level. Two colleagues are culturally aligned insofar as there have significant overlap in such assumptions, beliefs, and norms. Although interpersonal cultural alignment might be influenced by the strength of the overall organizational culture or its various subunits, prior work suggests that it can nevertheless vary substantially between individuals, dyads, and teams <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Lix et al. 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Lu et al. 2023)</ref>.</p><p>Across multiple disciplinary perspectives, organizational theorists have theorized and empirically demonstrated that interpersonal cultural alignment can facilitate coordination through such mechanisms as heightened motivation and shared commitment to joint goals <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">(O'Reilly III et al. 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Schein 2010</ref>; Van den Steen 2010), compatible linguistic "codes" that limit the risk of misunderstanding and confusion <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Lazear 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b124">Weber and Camerer 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Goldberg et al. 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Koçak and Puranam 2022)</ref>, and the ability to tacitly agree on and commit to the appropriate course of action in the face of uncertain contingencies <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Kreps 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Camerer and Vepsalainen 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Gibbons and Henderson 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Gibbons et al. 2021)</ref>. Whereas earlier work in this tradition implicitly assumed that cultural alignment is a relatively stable property, more recent work has shown that it can vary considerably over time given that people have to not only accurately decipher subtle shifts in norms and linguistic codes but also invest the effort to stay aligned with these changes <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">(Srivastava et al. 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Lu et al. 2023)</ref>. As a consequence, the degree of cultural alignment between individuals can be expected to vary significantly not only across dyads but also within the same dyads over time.</p></div>

For example, <ref type="bibr">Camerer and Vespalainen (1988)</ref>, as well as <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Kreps (1990)</ref>, propose that culture operates as an alternative to a written contract, thereby allowing employees to anticipate unknown contingencies and making their interactions more efficient by reducing the need for oversight. More recent work in organizational economics has formalized this notion as "relational contracts," informal agreements and unwritten codes of conduct that exist within and between firms and facilitate interpersonal coordination <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Baker et al. 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Gibbons and Henderson 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Gibbons et al. 2021)</ref>.</p><p>Separately, strategy researchers have proposed that "informal organization," which includes various facets of organizational culture, can effectively stand in for formal structure given that the former is characterized by inertia and the latter can only be episodically adjusted to meet changing environmental demands <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(Nickerson and Zenger 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Gulati and Puranam 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Puranam 2018</ref>).</p><p>These general arguments about the substitutability of structure and culture apply similarly at the micro-level with respect to the relationship between cultural similarity and formal supervision. For example, the first role of supervisors-the resolution of coordination problems and interpersonal dyadic conflict-is required to a much lesser extent when subordinates can rely on cultural similarity to better understand each other and share common values, reducing the likelihood of conflict and coordination failures in the first place <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Marchetti and Puranam 2023)</ref>. Moreover, supervisors are a scarce resource that organizational designers must allocate across the many individuals whose work must be coordinated. Supervisory capacity is in part constrained because of cognitive constraints that limit managerial spans of control, or the number of subordinates who can be effectively managed by a single supervisor <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Mintzberg 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Gittell 2001)</ref>. It is also limited by the time supervisors must allocate to activities other than facilitating information-processing among subordinates.</p><p>Given these natural limits on supervisory capacity in an organization, we posit that organizational designers will be apt to withhold this capacity from interfaces at which individuals can simply mutually adjust to one other by virtue of their cultural compatibility. For example, consider one dimension along which people may be culturally similar or dissimilar: their tendency to be task-and results-oriented versus relationship-and process-oriented when collaborating with peers. Two individuals with the same orientation (i.e., both are task-and results-oriented) are less likely to experience conflict when they have to coordinate their activities, thereby obviating the need for a supervisor. At such interfaces, culture will therefore substitute for formal structure.</p><p>Interpersonal Cultural Alignment and Formal Supervision as Complements.</p><p>Whereas the arguments about culture and structure functioning as substitutes have been explicitly made in prior studies, the ones suggesting that they are complements have been hinted at in two distinct literatures but mostly left implicit. First, some studies suggest that shared understandings among individuals can generate more value when a supervisor helps them direct their efforts towards clear goals or priorities (and vice versa). For example, theoretical work by <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Knudsen and Srikanth (2014)</ref> highlight two interrelated challenges that arise when specialist searchers have to coordinate their choices: mutual confusion and joint myopia. Sharing knowledge can reduce mutual confusion by creating greater cultural alignment between individuals but comes at the cost of joint myopia, as they get channeled into a narrower search space. The authors suggest that hierarchy may resolve this tension by sequencing actions or assigning people with different skills to different facets of the problem.</p><p>Recent empirical studies report evidence that is consistent with this intuition. Based on observational data on the electronic communications of software development teams, <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Lix et al. (2022)</ref> find that effective teams are ones with the capacity to modulate their levels of discursive diversity-that is, the degree to which the meanings expressed by team members diverge from each other in a given period-to match shifting task requirements.</p><p>They highlight the role of team leaders, who play a pivotal role in guiding the team to make such adjustments. Similarly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Clement (2023)</ref> empirically demonstrates that supervisors are especially valuable in promoting collective adaptation in situations likely to be interpreted similarly by all their members. The coordinating power of cultural similarity is most likely to deliver value if it is deployed coherently toward a common goal; conversely, a coherent plan is especially valuable when it is implemented efficiently by members who can efficiently arrive at a common understanding of it <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Lee and Puranam 2016)</ref>. Together, these studies suggest that, when work prioritization and sequencing are especially important, cultural alignment and formal supervision may function as complements.</p><p>A related research stream further suggests that cultural similarity is especially valuable among individuals working on the recombination of outputs from a variety of sources. For example, although they focus on informal, rather than formal, structure, <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Goldberg et al. (2016)</ref> find that the benefits of cultural similarity between an individual and her peer group are amplified for individuals whose networks reach across unconnected parts of a network. This suggests that access to external interfaces-which hierarchical superiors can unlock through referrals <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Galunic et al. 2012</ref>)-may be especially beneficial to individuals who are culturally similar to their contacts. One reason for this may be that, while advantaged network positions provide access to a variety of contacts, individuals need to be able to effectively process the information they receive from these contacts in order to make the most of it <ref type="bibr" target="#b119">(Tortoriello et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Clement et al. 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Although the aforementioned studies focus on the role of informal, rather than formal, structure in providing network access, their results are nevertheless relevant to our theory.</p><p>Providing access to interfaces and referrals to stakeholders outside of the units is, as noted above, a core supervisory function. A supervisor's referrals to other units are especially likely to yield value if their subordinates can build on a common understanding to help them integrate the inputs from different units. Conversely, culturally similar individuals may be especially successfully at recombining outputs from external sources when they can rely on a supervisor to facilitate access to such sources. This, again, suggests that another role of formal supervisors-coordinating outside their unit-generates complementarity rather than substitution between cultural alignment and formal supervision.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Moderating Role of Coordinative Complexity</head><p>The arguments above suggest that, at a given interface, cultural alignment and formal supervision may sometimes be redundant and, in other cases, may instead be synergistic.</p><p>Overall, their relationship likely depends on a host of supply-side factors-for example, how many supervisors exist or can be hired at a given hierarchical level and the span of control they can effectively manage, as well as demand-side variables such as how much time must be allocated to coordinating externally, prioritizing and sequencing the department's tasks, and coordinating internally. Yet, holding such factors constant, the arguments above suggest that this relationship should be driven by the relative importance of supervisors' three main roles at a given interface. Cultural similarity between employees should substitute for formal supervision in preventing or resolving conflicts and coordination failures. At the same time, cultural similarity should complement, rather than substitute for, a formal supervisor's role in prioritizing subordinates' work and coordinating with stakeholders outside their unit.</p><p>We argue that coordinative complexity affects the relative importance of these supervisory roles, thereby shaping whether cultural similarity complements or substitutes for formal supervision on the whole. We define coordinative complexity as the degree to which two individuals must interact with a wide variety of colleagues to accomplish their individual or joint tasks. Our conceptualization is at the dyad-level because this is the relevant unit of analysis for micro-level choices about where to erect or dismantle a supervisory unit between pairs of colleagues. When supervising employees engage in tasks that are high in coordinative complexity, supervisors must shift their activities in three key ways. First, the more interdependent a task is, the harder it is to determine the optimal manner in which its component parts should be tackled. Indeed, the interdependencies characterizing these tasks give rise to "local peaks:" different approaches to fulfilling requirements that can lead workers to either converge toward a suboptimal solution too quickly or explore too many possible solutions <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">(Rivkin and Siggelkow 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Fang et al. 2010)</ref>. Supervisors can address this problem by either prioritizing some aspects of a task at the expense of others or by better dividing the labor among subordinates based on their own knowledge of a task <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Levinthal and Warglien 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Ethiraj and Levinthal 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Keum and See 2017)</ref>. Neither of these roles is likely to be filled by cultural similarity alone.</p><p>Second, highly interdependent tasks demand inputs from actors in various parts of an organization, which may in turn require supervisors to play a bridging role even when their subordinates are highly skilled and culturally compatible <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">(Shi et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Galunic et al. 2012)</ref>. As coordinative complexity increases, there is often a concomitant expansion in the requirements for such external coordination. In such cases, a shared supervisor can then become essential to realizing the value of interpersonal cultural alignment. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">3</ref>Finally, tasks that depend on a multiplicity of actors and factors to be completed create more opportunities for misinterpretation and misunderstanding among the individuals carrying them out. This may trigger conflicts and coordination failures at a higher rate than even culturally similar individuals can solve them, requiring the involvement of a supervisor to resolve them. Overall, these arguments suggest that, when working on highly interdependent tasks, culturally aligned peers will benefit more from being placed into a supervisory unit than will culturally misaligned colleagues. All else equal, we therefore expect organizational designers to adjust formal structure in a way that takes this value into account. Focusing on cultural alignment that manifests in the language employees use when communicating with each other, we propose:</p><p>Main Hypothesis: The likelihood that linguistically aligned colleagues will become connected to each other in a supervisory unit increases with coordinative complexity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>METHOD Empirical Settings and Data</head><p>We conducted our analysis using data from a design services firm. The firm provides creative and technical design services, with both functional and location-based departments (e.g., design, operations, warehouse, sales, installation, marketing). Employees span a wide range of job titles, from client-facing roles (e.g., account managers) to creative (e.g., designers) and operational staff (e.g., installers, warehouse specialists). Work combines ongoing functional responsibilities with project-based collaboration, and formal reporting relationships often cut across departments and roles. We obtained a corpus of email messages exchanged among all full-time employees from 2013 to 2018 and monthly personnel records that matched the period of the communication data and included the following information for each individual: employee ID, demographic characteristics such as gender and race / ethnicity, start and exit date, department affiliation, job title, and-crucial for our purposes-supervisor ID. Importantly, all identifying information, as well as raw message content, were hashed (i.e., converted into an unrecognizable code) or otherwise transformed (e.g., into linguistic categories) before they were shared with us to protect employee privacy and company confidentiality. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> provides descriptive statistics about the organization.</p><p>- <ref type="figure">-----------</ref>Insert Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> about here ------------</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dependent Variable</head><p>Presence of Formal Tie. We began by transforming the individual-level personnal records into a dyad-level data set. Given that our personnel records included a field for supervisor ID in every month, we defined an indicator variable, Presence of Formal Tie, which was set to 1 in every month that two individuals had the same supervisor. From this information, we could derive the changing hierarchical structure of the organization over time. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">1</ref> depicts the hierarchical tree structure of the organization during the middle month in our observation period. Although there there are many shifts in reporting relationships, the overall hierarchical structure remains relatively stable in our observation window and typically includes eight levels. Our sample includes all possible employee pairs-including those who share a supervisor and those who do not-at the same hierarchical level. There if the organization either adds or removes a hierarchical level such that they experience a change in supervisor assignment. In supplemental analyses reported below, we disentangle these pathways by focusing on the subset of dyads who remain at the same hierarchical level throughout the observation period.</p><p>------------Insert Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">1</ref> about here ------------</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Independent Variables</head><p>Interpersonal Linguistic Alignment. Culture and cultural alignment are multifaceted constructs that have been defined somewhat differently across across disciplines and research traditions. These different conceptions broadly fit into two categories: cognitive and behavioral <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">(Pinker 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Schein 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Chatman and O'Reilly 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Mobasseri et al. 2019</ref>).</p><p>The former focuses on beliefs, assumptions, and values. Two individuals are cognitively culturally aligned insofar as they have overlapping beliefs, assumptions, and values. Yet individuals rarely have direct access to each other's inner thoughts and feelings. Rather, they draw (sometimes noisy) inferences about others' cognition by observing their behavior.</p><p>For example, noticing that a colleague reliably arrives to a meeting room a few minutes before the scheduled start time might lead one to conclude that this colleague values the principle of punctuality and may harshly judge those who are perennial late arrivals. Two individuals are behaviorally culturally aligned insofar as they act in accordance to the same set of behavioral norms-for example, both tending to arrive on time for meetings.</p><p>Cultural alignment can manifest across a wide range of behaviors, ranging from how people dress, how orderly or cluttered their workspaces are, or how intensely they work. Here we focus on one facet of behavioral cultural alignment: that which emerges in the natural language of employee-to-employee communications. Two individuals are linguistically culturally aligned insofar as they exhibit similar styles when communicating with each other.</p><p>Note that this is not about using the same words, which could simply indicate that two colleagues are working on the same project or assignment. Rather, organizations typically have strong norms about appropriate styles of communicating-for example, whether it is okay to swear in a workplace setting or the degree of formality or politeness or directness one should maintain when communicating with colleagues. Linguistic alignment has, in turn, been tied to various indicators of individual and group success <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Goldberg et al. 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b115">Srivastava et al. 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Lu et al. 2023)</ref>.</p><p>Drawing upon this intuition, we adapt the Interactional Language Use Model, which has been used in prior research to assess cultural alignment based on the similarity of linguistic styles exhibited by individuals or groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Goldberg et al. 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b115">Srivastava et al. 2018)</ref>. As these prior studies have done, we focus on linguistic styles as defined by the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) lexicon <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">(Pennebaker et al. 2007)</ref>. LIWC maps words into 64 higher-order categories of language-for example, positive emotion, negative emotion, time, and money. Prior work on linguistic cultural alignment has compared the distribution of a focal actor's language use across these categories to the distribution of language use by all her interlocutors in a given period. The less the divergence between these two distributions, the more the individual fits in linguistically with her peer group.</p><p>Departing from prior work in this vein, which focuses on individual-level cultural fit, we instead adapt the technique to develop a dyad-level measure. Specifically, we first obtain the distribution of all outgoing email messages by a given individual in a given month over the LIWC categories. For each dyad-month, we then define Linguistic Alignment as the negative log of the Jensen-Shannon divergence statistic between these distributions <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Lin 1991)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Moderators</head><p>Coordinative Complexity. Our measure of coordinative complexity is based on the range of peers that individuals coordinate with to accomplish their work. For each member of a dyad, we first measure how concentrated-based on the Herfindahl index-her outgoing communication is across the different job titles that exist in the organization. An individual exhibits greater coordinative complexity insofar as her communications are dispersed across a broad range of job titles rather than concentrated in just a few. We define the variable as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">D ut = 1 -Cut i∈Cut p 2 iut</formula><p>where C ut denotes the set of job title categories of the focal individual u's email contacts in month t, and p iut is the proportion of emails sent to each job title category i for the focal individual u in each month t.</p><p>Because our analyses are at the dyadic level, we define this measure for each dyad by taking the mean of the two members' values. Higher values indicate that the pair's communications are, on average, spread out across a wider range of job titles.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Control Variables</head><p>Because the likelihood of tie presence might be influenced by hierarchical levels, we include a control variable, Hierarchy, which varies from one to eight <ref type="bibr" target="#b128">(Zhou 2013)</ref>. Higher values represent more senior hierarchical ranks. Given that the likelihood of a tie forming or dissolving between two individuals, as well as their linguistic alignment or misalignment, could in principle be influenced by the volume of their communication exchange, we include Communication Intensity-measured by the percentage of monthly message exchanges between each dyadic pair in the total number of messages sent by that specific pair-as a control variable in our analyses. Because the likelihood of a formal tie may be affected by the supervisory capacity of the managers to whom dyad members report, we also control for Span of Control -measured by the average number of subordinates managed by the two supervisors of the dyad members. We separately estimated models that focus on between-versus within-dyad comparisons by excluding or including dyad fixed effects in our specifications.</p><p>In models without dyad fixed effects, we include the following indicator variables that are otherwise subsumed by dyad fixed effects: Same Gender, Same Ethnicity, Same Department, and Same Location. To account for possibly confounding and unobserved external events, all models include Month fixed effects.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Additional Variable for Mechanism Analysis</head><p>In supplemental analyses described below, we sought to test a core mechanism underpinning our theory: that organization designers will make changes to reporting relationships based in part on their understanding of the degree of interpersonal alignment between colleagues and the coordinative complexity of their work. This argument rests on the assumption that the degree of cultural alignment between colleagues and their coordinative complexity can be observed by organizational designers. To test this idea, we developed a measure of Visibility to organizational designers: the logarithm of the total number of email messages sent by a focal individual to her direct supervisor and skip-level supervisors along the hierarchical chain in a focal month, averaged between the two members of a dyad.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analytical Strategy</head><p>We estimated ordinary least squares (OLS) models of Presence of Formal Tie on the independent and control variables described above for the between-dyad sample (models without dyad fixed effects) 4 and conditional logit models for the within-dyad sample (models with dyad fixed effects). The use of dyad fixed effects addresses unobserved heterogeneity at both the individual level-for example, personality traits or prior educational background and work experiences that might influence the kind of supervisor a person is assigned to-and the dyad level-for example, whether two people are of the same gender or have similar personality traits. Unlike linear fixed-effects models, conditional logit models retain only dyads that exhibit variation in the dependent variable, dropping those with no change over time. This feature of the model avoids the bias toward zero in coefficient estimates, which can arise in linear fixed effect models <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Beck 2020)</ref>. All independent variables are lagged by one month to account for temporal ordering of their relationship to our dependent variable.</p><p>To account for the non-independence of observations in dyad-level data, we use two-way clustered standard errors <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Kleinbaum et al. 2013)</ref>. For ease of interpretation, the variables used in our regression analyses and marginal effects in the main results plots are based on standardized variables.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Suggestive Evidence of Mechanisms</head><p>Our results thus far provide micro-level evidence of how linguistic alignment and formal supervision co-evolve in our sample. Our theory assumes that organizational designers take into account linguistic alignment among the set of individuals whose work they oversee or could potentially oversee as they shift reporting relationships over time. These choices can arise either through proactive planning (i.e., observing linguistic alignment and taking it into account when assigning employees to supervisors) or trial-and-error learning (i.e., redesigning formal structure as a response to performance feedback).</p><p>To design formal structure in a way that conforms with their expectations about the value of placing culturally aligned individuals under the same supervisor, organizational designers must be able to observe whether two individuals are culturally aligned and whether their work entails complex coordination. Yet these factors-especially the degree of cultural alignment between two people-can be difficult to observe by others in the absence of direct interaction. Hence, if our theory is correct, one may expect our effect of interest to be especially strong for dyads whose cultural alignment can be observed by organizational designers. Our data allow us to provide evidence of this in two ways.</p><p>First, subordinates often vary significantly in the extent to which they interact with superiors <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">(Sparrowe and Liden 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Galunic et al. 2012)</ref>. This may affect both whether superiors are able to assess cultural alignment between specific subordinates and how much attention they allocate to them in the first place <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">(Rhee and Leonardi 2024)</ref>. Hence, we investigate whether the combined effect of cultural alignment and coordinative complexity on the design of formal structure is especially strong for dyads of individuals who have many interactions with their supervisors. Our data include all emails sent between members of the organizations and hence allow us to measure the extent to which each person communicates with the individuals susceptible of influencing their assignment to a new formal supervisor. Measuring these interactions requires us to formally operationalize the set of possible organizational designers who may affect the placement of each specific dyad in the formal structure. We define it as the set of hierarchical superiors to whom each member of a dyad is reporting either directly or indirectly, consistent with the notion that unit assignment decisions can be influenced by top managers, middle managers, or a combination of the two <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Ethiraj and Levinthal 2004)</ref>. Hence, Visibility measures to what extent a dyad is visible to the set of relevant organizational designers.</p><p>Models 4 and 8 in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> show a triple interaction between this variable and our two main variables of interest; we plot the results in Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">3</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">4</ref> for the between-dyad and within-dyad samples, respectively. Consistent with our reasoning, the positive moderating effect of coordinative complexity on the relationship between linguistic alignment and formal tie presence is stronger for dyads with a higher level of visibility to their hierarchical superiors.</p><p>------------Insert Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">3</ref> about here ------------------------Insert Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">4</ref> about here ------------Second, cultural alignment within a dyad is much easier for superiors to observe after the dyad has been assigned a common supervisor. This suggests that our effects of interest may be driven by trial-and-error learning (i.e., removing common supervisorship from dyads that do not seem to need it, including for reasons consistent with our theory) more than by proactive planning (i.e., assigning dyads to supervisors based on superiors' a priori expectations about the complementarity or substitution between cultural alignment and formal supervision). This suggests that the interaction between cultural alignment and coordinative complexity should predict the dissolution of common supervisorship ties more than their formation.</p><p>While our main analyses predict the presence of a common supervisorhip tie and hence do not separate tie formation from tie dissolution, our data allow us to do so. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref> shows our regression results when predicting separately the formation and dissolution of common supervisorship. For these analyses, we shift to Cox proportional hazard models <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Cox 1972</ref>) that separately considered: (a) dyads that do not have a shared supervisor at the start of the observation period; and (b) dyads that have a shared supervisor at the start of the observation period. In the former case, we estimate time to the establishment of a supervisory tie, and in the latter we estimate time to the ending of it.<ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">5</ref> Models of tie formation take the following form:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">R dt = H t • exp α + β 1 • LinguisticAlignment dt + β 2 • CoordinativeComplexity dt + γ 1 • LinguisticAlignment dt • CoordinativeComplexity dt + δX d + ϵ</formula><p>where R dt is the rate of formal tie formation for dyad d and at time t and H t is an unspecified function of time between the formations. X d are control variables. Models of formal tie dissolution take a comparable form, with the coefficients of the variables of interest interpreted in the opposite direction.</p><p>Models 3 and 7 in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref> show that the moderating effect of coordinative complexity is strong for both tie formation and dissolution. Models 4 and 8 further show that the triple interaction between visibility and our two main variables of interest is more pronounced in the formal tie dissolution sample; we plot these results in Figures A1 and A2 in the Appendix. These figures suggest that high visibility makes forward planning possible and substantially enhances the effectiveness of trial-error-learning. Taken together, these findings provide suggestive evidence that the interplay between linguistic alignment and coordinative complexity influences supervisory decisions about both bringing individuals together and separating them within the formal structure, with visibility playing a particularly critical role in facilitating trial-and-error learning relative to proactive planning.</p><p>------------Insert Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref> about here ------------</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Additional Analyses and Robustness Checks</head><p>We also conducted a portfolio of robustness checks, the details of which are provided in the Appendix, to address potential alternative explanations for our findings. Here we summarize these analyses and their conclusions. First, to account for the possibility that our observed effects merely reflect known or anticipated transitions-for example, a person becoming more culturally aligned with a peer in anticipation of moving into the same department-we estimated models with longer lags of the independent variables. The pattern of results is similar, although some of the coefficients of interest become marginally significant due to the drop in number of observations as we increase the lag period. These analyses and results are presented in the Appendix, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">A1</ref>.</p><p>In the Appendix, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">A2</ref>, we seek to unpack whether the effects we theorize might differ for horizontal moves-that is, two peers either come into the same supervisory unit or move to different ones while both remaining at the same hierarchical level-versus for vertical moves-that is, two peers experience a change in shared supervisory status by virtue of one getting promoted or, much less commonly, demoted. The pattern of results remains mostly consistent when we restrict the sample to dyads that remain at the same horizontal level throughout the observation period.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p>Building on research that uncovers the microfoundations of organizational structure and how it evolves over time, we advance a theory that can explain where in an organization one of the most elemental forms of structure-the assignment of two employees to a common supervisor-is likely to emerge or dissolve. In doing so, we engage with and help to reconcile a theoretical tension in the literature: Some prior studies have proposed that culture functions as a substitute for formal structure, while others have implied that the two are instead complements. Highlighting the role of coordinative complexity in shaping the dynamic interplay between culture and structure, we advance a simple and generalizable proposition: The tendency for linguistic similarity to complement, rather than substitute for, formal structure increases with coordinative complexity.</p><p>Using granular administrative records on routine shifts in supervisory reporting relationships, as well as a language-based measure of cultural similarity derived from employees' email communications, we first demonstrate that culture (in the form of language) and structure can indeed operate as substitutes in some setting and as complements in others. The positive main effect of linguistic similarity on the likelihood of subsequent formal tie presence suggests that culture and structure operate, on average, as complements in this setting. We also find, consistent with our theory, a positive interaction between linguistic similarity and coordinative complexity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Contributions</head><p>Findings from this study contribute to research on when and how organizations experience shifts in formal structure, which has been a topic of major interest in the literature on strategy and organizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Hannan and Freeman 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Osterman 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Nickerson and Zenger 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Balogun and Johnson 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Lin et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Gulati and Puranam 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Guadalupe and Wulf 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Raveendran 2020)</ref>. The picture that emerges from much of this literature is that of formal structure being a fairly stable organization-level characteristic, with periods of punctuated, large-scale change that occurs in response to shifts in technology, competitive pressures, and internal leadership transitions. Culture, insofar as it appears in these accounts, has generally also been treated as an organization-level property (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Nickerson and Zenger 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Gulati and Puranam 2009)</ref>. Meanwhile, the studies that have examined the microfoundations of formal structure and how it can endogenously change by virtue of factors internal to the organization have generally overlooked the role of culture and mostly derived insights using agent-based simulations (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">Siggelkow and Rivkin 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Clement and Puranam 2018)</ref>. We add to these lines of work by demonstrating how endogenous change in formal structure can also arise through ongoing shifts in small-scale culture <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Eliasoph and Lichterman 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b114">Srivastava and Banaji 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Fine 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Lu et al. 2023</ref>)-the degree of linguistic alignment between individuals-as well as the complexity of the tasks they are engaged in. Moreover, our results reinforce the external validity of microfoundational research through empirical evidence from the administrative records and electronic communications of organizations.</p><p>Next, this study contributes to cross-disciplinary research that examines the efficiency benefits of corporate culture <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Camerer and Vepsalainen 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Kreps 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b124">Weber and Camerer 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b122">Van den Steen 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Chatman et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Corritore et al. 2020)</ref>. Across the fields of economics, finance, sociology, strategy, and organizational behavior, the dominant assumption has been that cultural alignment eases interpersonal coordination such that it can effectively substitute for formal structure. In contrast, we develop the novel argument that culture can instead complement formal structure, and we highlight the conditions-based on the degree of coordinative complexity of the work peers are engaged in-under which this is likely to be the case. In doing so, we also contribute to the broader sociological project of understanding how structure and culture are mutually constitutive <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">(Sewell 1992</ref> Finally, the study makes several methodological contributions to research on structure and culture in organizations. First, whereas prior work on the microfoundations of formal structure has considered whether one actor is another's supervisor or subordinate (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">Siggelkow 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b109">Soda and Zaheer 2012)</ref>, we expand the conceptualization and measurement of a supervisory unit from the individual to the dyadic level-that is, whether two individuals are connected to each other in formal structure by virtue of having the same boss. We believe this broader conceptualization and our associated measurement strategy are better suited to understanding how coordination occurs within organizations than are individual-level approaches. In similar fashion, we redefine the construct of "cultural fit," which has heretofore been conceptualized and operationalized as the extent to which a focal individual is cognitively and behaviorally aligned with such reference groups as the individual's current interlocutors, her department, and the organization as a whole <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">(O'Reilly III et al. 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Rivera 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Doyle et al. 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Mobasseri et al. 2019)</ref>, such that it operates, and is measured, at the level of dyads rather than individuals. Finally, we introduce a novel measure of coordinative complexity, which is based on emergent patterns of communication between focal dyads and the job titles of their peers in the organization.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations and Future Directions</head><p>We acknowledge that the study has certain limitations, which also point to avenues for future research. First, although we estimate models with lagged independent variables to establish the temporal ordering of effects, our research design does not yield causal estimates. Our additional analyses provide suggestive evidence of mechanisms that are consistent with our theory, and our robustness checks should help to address concerns that we are merely picking up on known transitions from one job role to the next. That said, there are a host of unobserved factors-for example, individual-level shifts in knowledge or expertise-that could simultaneously influence cultural similarity between peers and their likelihood of being placed within the same supervisory unit, and we cannot fully exclude the possibility that such factors are driving our results. Future studies would benefit from identifying exogenous shifts in cultural similarity-for example, a downsizing or large-scale reorganization that does not affect a focal pair of individuals but, by virtue of compositional shifts in their respective peer groups, changes the degree of cultural similarity between them. Similarly, it may be possible to find exogenous sources of variation in coordinative complexity-for example, based on the adoption of a new technology that changes the nature of interpersonal coordination. Another limitation of our data is that we do not directly observe the nature of the tasks that pairs of employees are engaged in at a given point in time. Task interdependence, which is partly shaped by an organization's choice of technology and division of labor, has long been tied to choices about formal structure (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">Thompson 1967)</ref>. Prior studies have sought to assess the nature of these interdependencies by examining documented workflows and administering surveys <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Gokpinar et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b109">Soda and Zaheer 2012)</ref>. In contrast, our models include an admittedly imperfect proxy for shifting task interdependence: the intensity of communication between each pair of employees in the prior period. Relative to typical survey-based measures of task interdependence, this measure has the advantage of picking up on subtle shifts in task interdependence that may occur over time. Yet it also conflates task-related communication with social and other types of exchange. Hence, while our analytical strategy was to identify the effect of culture on formal structure net of changes in task interdependence among employees, it may have done so imperfectly. Future studies could address this limitation by including data from organizations that use online project management platforms that include records of specific activities assigned to individuals and the interdependencies among them.</p><p>Finally, our measure of cultural similarity is based on a single form of expression, email messages, which are transformed into the relatively simple LIWC lexicon. Yet cultural expression in organizations occurs in multiple ways that are not reflected in our data-for example, how people speak in face-to-face or virtual meetings, how they dress, and how they represent shared beliefs in the form of artifacts <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">(Schein 2010)</ref>. The growing availability of data sources that go beyond text-for example, audio and video recordings from virtual meetings-and computational methods for processing such data open the door to the development of more sophisticated measures of interpersonal cultural alignment (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">Williams et al. 2020)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>Organizational theorists have long recognized that structure and culture are two of the most powerful forces that facilitate interpersonal coordination and thereby enable organizations to function effectively. Yet the interrelationships between them are obscured when we examine organizations at a macro scale. To understand when and how they are redundant or instead synergistic, it is necessary to delve into the elemental level of workplace interaction. In deciding where managers are needed, our study points to a simple heuristic: Focus supervisory capacity on interfaces with high levels of interpersonal linguistic alignment and coordinative complexity, while potentially removing it from interfaces that do not have these attributes.          </p></div>

Panels (a) and (b) show the interaction effects of coordinative complexity in the within-and between-dyad samples. In both settings, linguistically aligned individuals are more likely to work under the same supervisor when these individuals work on tasks involving complex coordination, and this moderation effect is quite substantial. The baseline predicted probability of a supervisory tie existing between dyads at the mean level of linguistic alignment and the mean level of coordinative complexity is 0.283 in the within-dyad sample. A one standard deviation increase in linguistic alignment is associated with a 0.022 change in the predicted probability of a supervisory tie existing in the next period for dyads with low coordinative complexity but a 0.052 change for dyads with high coordinative complexity in the within-dyads sample.</figDesc></figure>

It would be useful in future research to survey organizational designers about the logic underpinning their supervisor allocation choices and to measure the performance consequences of the shifts in supervisory capacity they make.</figDesc></figure>

			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="3" xml:id="foot_0"><p>Note that our arguments center on colleagues who are culturally aligned. When two individuals are culturally misaligned, it is conceptually ambiguous whether organizational designers would place them under a common supervisor or instead rely on various control systems to ensure that they coordinate effectively. On one hand, bringing them together under a shared supervisor might be beneficial if the supervisor can force them to align in their ways of working together-for example, by requiring one to adopt the working style of the other or negotiating a compromise between the two styles. On the other, such an investment is costly and may require the supervisor's ongoing attention and involvement to adjudicate what might be deeply rooted differences in their preferences. Moreover, any conflicts that arise between these individuals have the potential to spillover to others in the supervisory unit. In such cases, it may be better to leave them structurally separated and instead rely on rules, standard operating procedures, output standards, and so on to align their respective activities<ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Daft and Lengel 1986)</ref>.</p></note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="4" xml:id="foot_1"><p>We use OLS as a linear probability model for binary outcomes, a widely used approach in applied research, because its coefficients are directly interpretable as changes in probability and the model accommodates clustered standard errors<ref type="bibr" target="#b126">(Wooldridge 2010)</ref>. While OLS can in principle produce predictions outside the [0,1] range, our predicted probabilities fall within reasonable bounds (2-20%). Results are also robust to logit specifications.</p></note>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Appendix: Supplemental Analysis and Robustness Checks</head><p>We first sought to rule out an alternative explanation for our findings: that our observed effects are an artifact of anticipated role transitions. In other words, they reflect shifts in linguistic alignment that occur when people find out that they will be moving to a different supervisory unit, even if the actual move occurs a few weeks after they learn of the impending change. Recall that our main models already include independent variables that are lagged by one month relative to our dependent variable. That said, we estimated models with longer lag periods. Table <ref type="table">A1</ref> reports results based on two-month lags. The pattern of results looks comparable to our main models; however, Linguistic Alignment # Coordinative Complexity in Table <ref type="table">A1</ref>, Model 6 becomes marginally significant given that the number of observations also decreases as we move from a one-month to a two-month lag. Overall, this pattern of results helps to rule out anticipated role transitions as an alternative explanation for our findings.</p><p>- <ref type="figure">-----------</ref>Insert Table <ref type="table">A1</ref> about here ------------Next we sought to unpack whether our hypothesized effects differ for horizontal moves-that is, two peers either come into the same supervisory unit or move to different ones while both remaining at the same hierarchical level-relative to for vertical moves-that is, two peers experience a change in shared supervisory status by virtue of one getting promoted or, much less commonly, demoted. As reported in Table <ref type="table">A2</ref>, the results remain fairly consistent when we restrict the sample to dyads that remain at the same horizontal level throughout the observation period. We find that Linguistic Alignment # Coordinative Complexity is significant and of the expected sign (Table <ref type="table">A2</ref>, Models 3 and 6). Overall, this pattern of results suggests that the dynamics of linguistic alignment and coordinative complexity are not fundamentally different when we consider shifts in formal structure that are driven by horizontal versus vertical movement.</p><p>------------Insert Table <ref type="table">A2</ref> about here ------------------------Insert Figure <ref type="figure">A1</ref> about here ------------------------Insert Figure <ref type="figure">A2</ref> about here ------------</p></div>			</div>
