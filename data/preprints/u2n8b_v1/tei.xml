<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Background: Underpinning invasion and ongoing colonisation of the lands now known as Australia, scientific racism in colonial research delivered flawed results and indelible negative stereotypes by building Indigenous inferiority into methodology to produce dehumanising conclusions of First Nations Peoples. Scientific racism facilitated exclusion of First Nations Peoples from the design, implementation, and evaluation of systems such as healthcare; foregrounding ways exclusive and enforced colonial health systems cause First Nations health and wellbeing inequality. Inequities in foot health contribute to this inequality, yet as mainstream foot health researchers, non-Indigenous people do not privilege First Nations leadership in research to empower First Nations self-determined ways of keeping feet strong. This work describes and documents a process of First Nations-led authentic co-design for foot health research. This study represents ways and means to develop culturally responsive foot health research as judged by First Nations Peoples which will translate into improved and more responsive ways of delivering foot care. Previous First Nations-led research describes increased Community engagement with podiatry services when culturally responsive aspects feature. Methods: Non-Indigenous and First Nations Peoples sought authentic First Nations-led co-design process in foot health research methods which redistributed power in ways of working to local First Nations Peoples, a First Nations Advisory Group, and broader First Nations governance and ethics approvals. Time was taken long before work began to talk about Community-identified needs and ways of working in foot health research that would make research spaces culturally responsive, and bring benefits to First Nations individuals and families, all as judged by First Nations Peoples. Building long-term, ongoing, mutually beneficial relationships included non-Indigenous development of deeper listening skills to hear truth-telling about mistrust in colonial healthcare research and racism in colonial healthcare services. Indigenous methodology, data sovereignty, and redistribution of power were imperative in ways of working. First Nations-led co-design developed culturally responsive semi-structured interviews to collect data. Talking with ten registered health practitioners who work closely with lower limb and foot health represented the right mix of participants and enough data to convey a more complicated mosaic of multi-faceted stories. First Nations expertise informed analytic induction and the use of inductive reasoning and constant comparison to identify common and overarching themes, and to perform thematic analysis. Results: Authentic First Nations-led ways of working in cross-sectional qualitative study design are documented. Results of data analysis following these ways of working will be published subsequently.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion:</head><p>Decolonising foot health research is a means to improving First Nations health outcomes. This work provides insights into working right ways in research which will underpin good foot health services with and for First Nations Peoples. The paper highlights ways of working that empowers First Nations Peoples in authentic co-design. First Nations-led foot health research changes ways of working to counter inequities in foot health caused and maintained by ongoing colonisation and systemic racism. This study provides qualified voiced lived experience which foot health researchers must listen to and receive learning and direction from.</p></div>

In the context of the lands now known as Australia, scientific racism provided platform for invasion and ongoing colonisation <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref>. Scientific racism in colonial research established flawed belief in a biological and genetically inherent racial hierarchy <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22)</ref> which dehumanised First Nations Peoples. When dehumanised, ongoing invasion focused on extermination of First Nations Peoples, with exploitation an embedded by-product <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref>. Scientific racism's flawed method and racist ideology <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref> underpinned social, biological, and anthropological research in fields including Phrenology and Eugenics <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24)</ref>. Devoid of consent, scientifically racist colonial research methods were imposed upon First Nations Peoples, being done on and to, rather than with and for <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26)</ref>. Overtly racist work oversaw immoral, unethical research conducted upon bodies and bones <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17)</ref> of First Nations Peoples positioned as specimens, less than, and othered <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27)</ref>. Endorsed by academics, First Nations oppression and trauma <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28)</ref> was consolidated by published scientific racism across the land now known as Australia which ascribed primitive theology, poorly evolved family structures, and most primitive form of human to First Nations Peoples, whilst comparing to European man as a standard of perfection <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref>. Scientific racism delivered erroneous results and indelible negative stereotypes through means of building Indigenous inferiority into methodology <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref> to produce inferiorising conclusions of First Nations Peoples <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref>. Colonial research facilitated colonisation of Australia with established power differentials <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30)</ref> justifying displacement from Country, genocidal interventions, and destruction of means of First Nations knowledge creation, dissemination, and preservation. Scientific racism in colonial research predicated exclusion of First Nations Peoples from political, economic, education, legal, and health system design, implementation, evaluation, and research <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref>. 'Eurocentric constructions of the racialised Other, the construction of whiteness, and its subsequent embodiment, enabled the establishment of this far-flung outpost of British imperialism' <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref>. As a tool of colonisation, scientific racism in colonial research set precedent for intellectual terra nullius <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(31)</ref>, destroying Indigenous knowledge systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25)</ref>, and normalising superiority of White people and culture <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32)</ref>. Truth-telling about the history of research violence used in colonising the lands now known as Australia includes 'salvaging data on a dying race for science' <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(33)</ref>, prioritising data collection over providing healthcare, which associates research and researchers with active participation in genocide. Research methods used today are a legacy of ongoing colonisation, skewed social viewpoints, and biased datasets from past scientifically racist studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref>. Globally, mainstream research methods are driven by a Western scientific model that is informed by past scientific racism as well a Western value set for research; the ways research is valued, and the ways evidence is conceptualised. In a domestic context, research methods privileging Eurocentric value sets and means of knowledge development facilitate learnings and frameworks that drive and support Western knowledge systems, silencing First Nations ways of knowing, being, and doing <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18)</ref>. This perpetuates ongoing harms to First Nations Peoples. The United Nations Declaration of the Rights of Indigenous Peoples is contravened where First Nations Peoples lose control of maintaining knowledges systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref>, so as mainstream foot health researchers we need to understand and respect this. Mainstream foot health research needs to broaden intellectual investments in First Nations health, address power imbalances causing health inequities, and see First Nations Peoples as architects of health advancement <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34)</ref>. Eurocentric healthcare systems founded and developed by mainstream research across the lands now known as Australia impose an 8-9 year less life expectancy for First Nations Peoples <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36)</ref>, as well as a poorer quality of life, with the burden of disease experienced by First Nations Peoples 2.3 times the rate of non-Indigenous Australians and diabetes burden 6 times as high <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(37)</ref>. Systemic inequities in foot health research, aggregated epidemiological foot health statistics, teaching and learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(38)</ref>, and service delivery contribute to this inequality <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40)</ref>. As foot health researchers, meaningfully working to support self-determined First Nations ways of working is a means of redistributing power in First Nations-led co-design of foot health research, education, and health systems that centre culture in health and healing <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(41)</ref> and work for First Nations Peoples as judged by First Nations Peoples. Research discourse shaped by white hegemony presents problems experienced by First Nations populations as a product of First Nations incapacity <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(42)</ref>. To revert from such victim-blaming, non-Indigenous capacity in anti-racist research and service delivery needs development <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(43)</ref>; ongoing non-Indigenous ignorance of, and inaction to, will only serve to maintain oppression whilst preventing unlearning of whose attitudes and ways of working need addressing to achieve First Nations equality <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(42)</ref>. Ways of working in foot health research to bring about epistemological, ontological, and axiological change need to privilege First Nations methodologies. Aboriginal Participatory Action Research (PAR) is an Indigenous Research Methodology informed by Indigenous Standpoint Theory developed by First Nations researchers, scientists, Elders, and Communities <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(44)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(45)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(46)</ref>. Aboriginal PAR aligns with First Nations empowerment and selfdetermination, and with First Nations cultural recognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(46)</ref>. Methodology recognises First Nations sovereign knowledge and restores First Nations knowledge systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47)</ref>. In authentic co-design of foot health research, power is redistributed to First Nations Peoples to lead work in which Indigenous methodologies are privileged and in which non-Indigenous peoples are positioned as supportive learners. Research may then be relational to the physical and spiritual <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(48)</ref>, constructing foot health knowledge aligned with First Nations value sets, ethics, and guidelines <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(46)</ref>. Authentic First Nations-led co-design needs to be applied within foot health research processes to create culturally responsive research projects that are safe for First Nations participants, and which prioritise needs and outcomes as determined by First Nations Communities. This empowers First Nations direction of design, implementation, and evaluation of foot health systems outputs, and informs governance. The primary aim of this work therefore is to follow Aboriginal PAR methodology <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(46)</ref> to document First Nations determined ways of working with and for First Nations Peoples in foot health research. This privileges First Nations ways of working in science and research which have been practised on the continent now known as Australia since time immemorial <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(49)</ref> to provide learning in decolonisation of the foot health research space. Aware that a majority of First Nations Peoples live in regional and urban areas, but also that rural areas are locations of poorer health outcomes for all Australians, including First Nations Peoples (50, 51), the secondary aim of this work is to utilise First Nations ways of working in research in investigating what foot health means to First Nations and non-Indigenous health practitioners working in rural foot health, as well as their perspectives of the needs for and service barriers to providing good foot care with and for First Nations Peoples. Results of analysing data collected following ways of working described in this paper will be published in subsequent work. Accumulatively, this research with and for First Nations Peoples delivers transformative learning so that non-Indigenous foot and lower limb health workforce and mainstream healthcare improve cultural responsiveness skills and ways of doing that work to eliminate racism from foot health, stop systems killing and traumatising First Nations Peoples, and improve upon the little non-Indigenous providers know about authentic podiatry services with and for First Nations Peoples <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(40)</ref>. This study is part of work supporting First Nations-led, culturally informed, Community-driven solutions to foot disease. To this end, may future service delivery for First Nations individuals, families, and Communities be led in design, implementation, and evaluation by First Nations individuals, families, and Communities, and be supported by non-Indigenous people.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ways of working</head><p>This research was led by Indigenous research methodology; Aboriginal PAR <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(46)</ref> underpinned by selfdetermination and First Nations Advisory Group. PAR is a transformative paradigm promoting social justice <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(52)</ref>. Aboriginal PAR integrates Indigenous epistemology, ontology, axiology (the equivalent language for Indigenous ways of knowing, being and doing) in Western knowledge systems and the dominant culture in the land now known as Australia <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">53,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">54)</ref>. This study used Aboriginal PAR to privilege First Nations research priorities and to engage and privilege First Nations Peoples in research processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(55)</ref> and culturally valid and meaningful knowledge development <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(55)</ref>. Privileging Indigenous research methodology is to meaningfully contribute to reclamation, rebuilding, and reinstatement of self-determined First Nations knowledge systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref>. Aboriginal PAR leading this research seeks change from decades of historical and ongoing systemic racism perpetuating power imbalance and resultant health inequities and inequality <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(43)</ref>. This work seeks appraisal as a true, correct, and beneficial result of a participatory process of First Nations empowered and led co-design by First Nations Peoples.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Relationships</head><p>Not to be understated, this work was planned with and for Darkinyung and Wiradjuri families, Elders, and Communities with whom there were, and still are, long-established, mutually beneficial, trusting relationships. These relationships existed well before plans of undertaking research work together evolved and were founded upon years of individual, family, and Community engagement, familiarity, and humility. Method privileged these relationships in leading the work, in decolonising research <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref>, and in rebutting 'Historical White Institutions' (HWI) <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(56)</ref> 'misappropriating Aboriginal Knowledge Systems by allowing non-Indigenous people to lead and act as 'Mission Managers' over Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander ways of knowing, being and doing' <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(56)</ref>. Ways of working included non-Indigenous researchers developing understanding of Aboriginal PAR and decentring whiteness as an epistemological norm and resultant hegemony <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">57)</ref>. Positioning one's non-Indigenous self as a learner, un-learner, and re-learner in relationships, with understanding that learning, un-learning, and re-learning is ongoing, underpinned non-Indigenous support of First Nations-led research ways of working.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Local First Nations leaders</head><p>Local First Nations leaders invited non-Indigenous researchers with whom there were existing, long-standing, trusting relationships onto Country and into Community to do work. This research responded to the need for equity in delivery, and equality in outcome, of foot care services as determined by Darkinyung and Wiradjuri individuals, families, and Communities, and more broadly, diverse First Nations Peoples across Country. The study was positioned with First Nations governance established in the Darkinjung and Wiradjuri research "Footprints for Life" <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(58)</ref> which this research extends upon. This study had First Nations leadership, being part of a PhD project with four First Nations people with expertise in First Nations health and research leading design, development, and implementation as research supervisors. These First Nations members of the research supervisory team formed a separate governance mechanism for this qualitative study, a selfdetermined First Nations Advisory Group. Local First Nations leaders and First Nations Advisory Group leadership established what non-Indigenous researchers needed to be thinking about, privileging, learning, unlearning, and relearning across all levels of work. Embedding NHMRC core values, AH&amp;MRC holds research accountable to five key principles in meaningful, ethical, and culturally responsive work <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(65)</ref>. Privileging First Nations leadership in local ethics prioritises net benefits for Aboriginal Communities, Aboriginal Community control of research, cultural responsiveness, reimbursement of costs, and enhancing Aboriginal capacity <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(65)</ref>. Fundamentally, ways of working described by both local and overarching First Nations leadership included non-Indigenous members of the research team working to redistribute power and to de-centre the dominant Western academy; providing platform for First Nations voices to be listened to in the foot health research space.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ways of working in foot health</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Non-linear lens</head><p>First Nations leadership embedded relational ways of working in this foot health research. From the outset, research was considered in terms of how it may be appraised by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander quality appraisal tool (66) once the work was completed. This First Nations-led tool was specifically developed to appraise health research with and for First Nations Peoples <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(66)</ref>. Positioning the tool as directive had non-Indigenous researchers clearly thinking about authentic First Nations Community consultation and priorities, empowered First Nations leadership, First Nations cultural protocols relative to place, and Indigenous methodology in their ways of working. Consulting the appraisal tool before and then during work made it continually relational to ways of working. This guided ways of working that were not consistently linear progressive, but rather ways which paused, went back to the past, moved sideways for consideration and support, which considered transformative journeys of people involved, and which considered research practices and outcomes in the context of time passed since 1788. Continually re-evaluating ways of working was not sequential nor straightforward, but revolved around ongoing relearning which centred guidelines, appraisal tools, local First Nations leaders, and what Community are saying. This non-linear lens consolidated a place of 2-way learning and an undertaking of strengths-based approaches which acknowledged and moved beyond practices that have that have contributed to genocide of First Nations Peoples <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(67)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study design</head><p>Ways of working privileged Aboriginal PAR <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(46)</ref> in cross-sectional qualitative study design. Inclusive research development and consultation led by Darkinyung and Wiradjuri Elders, First Nations Advisory Group, and broader First Nations Community members regarding all levels and constructs of work chose semi-structured interviewing, a frequently used technique of interviewing within qualitative healthcare research <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(68,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">69)</ref>, for this study. Semi-structured interviewing following a constructivist phenomenological approach to generate data was well suited to the setting and research objectives <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(52,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(70)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(71)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(72)</ref>. Such design facilitates rich open-ended data inclusive of thoughts, feelings, beliefs and lived experiences and can explore more personal and sensitive issues relating to health services <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(68)</ref>. In this research, First Nations leadership of semi-structured interview guides developed talking points about what foot health means to First Nations and non-Indigenous health practitioners, as well as their perspectives regarding needs for, challenges in accessing, and barriers to providing good foot health care with and for First Nations Peoples. Study design was planned and adapted as creating a more culturally responsive space that First Nations people are more likely to judge and experience as safe, and to translate study findings into sustainable changes in policy and practice that bring benefits to First Nations individuals, families, and Communities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study participants and selection procedures</head><p>With ways of working grounded in Aboriginal PAR, First Nations Advisory group leadership and non-Indigenous researchers developed strength-based, culturally responsive research email communication, Participant Information Statement, Consent Form, and Withdrawal of Consent Form to create a research space that, from first interaction with the project, would be more likely to be deemed safe to approach and use by First Nations participants. Most importantly, this way of working clearly positioned First Nations leadership in research and decolonised the language used. This way of working minimised the risk of selection bias in this study where First Nations Peoples could hesitate to participate because of judged lack of safety in work and/or triggering of historical mistrust in research underpinned by scientific racism <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">73)</ref>. Potentially eligible participants were identified through professional clinical, Community, and research groups. Participants were sent initial emails inviting participation in the research. Semi-structured interview sample size was n = 10. In mainstream research, qualitative sample sizes are commonly determined by reaching thematic saturation <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(68)</ref>, deemed to have occurred when interviews fail to produce new information <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(74,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">75)</ref>. Mainstream literature reports that highly meaningful healthcare research utilising semi-structured interviewing may be completed with as few as 8-12 participants <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(68,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(76)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(77)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(78)</ref>, but does raise that in qualitative health research, sample size insufficiency is seen to threaten the validity and generalisability of studies' results; often in general scientific terms <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(79)</ref>. Mainstream method additionally advises involving sample size considerate of homogeneity of the sample <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(68,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">78)</ref> and of epistemological and methodological influences <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(79,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">80)</ref>. This work considers sample size in the context of Indigenous methodologies, where thematic saturation has no parallel, where there is an expectation that researcher/participant relationships found the work, and where these respectful, mutually beneficial, foundational relationships are ongoing <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(81,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">82)</ref>. Within the land now known as Australia, recent qualitative health research involving First Nations and non-Indigenous researchers, First Nations participants, local First Nations-led research sub-committee endorsement for ethics approval, and semi-structured interviewing rested on sample size being a result of the right mix of participants and enough data to convey a more complicated mosaic of multi-faceted stories <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(83)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(84)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(85)</ref>. Ways of working guiding selection procedures in this work replicate this. Sample size is considerate of the diversity of First Nations Peoples. Ways of working do not homogenise working with and for over 240 First Language groups, cultures, lore, and ways of conducting science and research. Ways of working aim to deliver some overarching results, some points to be clearly considering, and some reproducible ways of working which may be used relative to place. Ways of working regarding selection procedures highlight ongoing relationships are of prioritised importance in working right ways in First Nations foot health research and that saturation of data judging finality and all there is to know on a topic, combined with homogenising generalisability to diverse populations, deems competence in another culture, positions it as less than, and reinforces epistemological power imbalance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participant recruitment</head><p>Sampling that was purposive and seeking large variation was used to recruit health practitioners providing foot care with and for First Nations Peoples that was representative of the clinician population (based on the cultural aspects of identity and experience, and based on workplace setting). Health practitioners delivering services relating to foot care with and for First Nations Peoples were recruited to participate in semistructured interviews. Healthcare workforce eligible to participate in this aspect of the research needed to hold current registration with their discipline's professional registration board. The details of the study (Participant Information Statement, Consent Form, and Withdrawal of Consent Form) were issued well before interview dates, with informed written consent being obtained prior to conducting any interview. Ways of working directed that time be taken to allow participants to discuss participation with family, friends, Community, and workplace. Consent forms in this work were developed with First Nations Advisory Group leadership and contained the question 'Are you Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander?' This question was prefaced with introduction to providing a subsequent culturally responsive interview space, to being able to report ethnicity in data, and to privileging First Nations voices and worldviews in the results of the work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data collection</head><p>With First Nations Advisory Group leadership, the research team developed two series of open-ended questions informed by Aboriginal PAR, First Nations Advisory Group expertise, and recent literature, which were used as guides during interviews. Responses to the question 'Are you Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander?' determined which set of semi-structured interview questions would be used during interviewing; questions for First Nations participants or questions for non-Indigenous participants. Although similar, the difference in phrasing and positionality in sets of interview questions foregrounded Aboriginal PAR ways of working and cultural responsiveness in conducting interviews. Research interviews primarily followed a line of pre-determined questioning, with allowance for follow-up unrehearsed questions based upon participant responses during interviews. Because of this, and as part of culturally responsive ways of working in research, First Nations participants were also offered a First Nations member of the research team be present during data collection. This method aimed to empower First Nations Peoples' self-determined participation in the work, aimed to address power imbalance in interviewing, and aimed to rebut the stigma of historical scientific racism. Interview questions developed with First Nations Advisory Group leadership embedded avoiding critiquing care provision and, in the case of non-Indigenous participation, avoiding speaking for First Nations Peoples. Interview questions developed with the First Nations Advisory Group were pilot tested with a First Nations research team member who was blinded to the interview guide before any data collection interviews were conducted. Data collection was conducted online with semi-structured interviews all completed via Zoom Video Communications teleconference software at a time and place convenient to consenting participants. Participants consented to interviews being audio recorded using Zoom software and backed up with Dictaphone recordings, whilst additionally having field notes taken to inform later data analysis. All participants were given the opportunity to verify their data afterwards and were additionally given the opportunity to read final manuscript drafting prior to any submission for publication. This presented First Nations participants the opportunity to check that their data was accurate and had not been misconstrued or taken out of context during research process. It provided chance for First Nations participants to check that they were not misrepresented by the work and to build trust in culturally responsive ways of working in foot health research.</p></div>

Ways of working in this study negotiated rights to access First Nations existing cultural and intellectual property from the outset, with full disclosure and transparency including describing proposed ways of disseminating results. Founded in scientific racism, data on and about, not with and for First Nations Peoples has been weaponised against First Nations Peoples (87, 88), negatively stereotyping First Nations Peoples as a different, dysfunctional, and disadvantaged problem needing to be fixed <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(88,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">89)</ref>. BADDR data are data which are Blaming, Aggregate, Decontextualised, Deficit focused data of Restricted access <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">(89)</ref>.

As in this study, foot health research needs to align with Maiam nayri Wingara principles of Indigenous Data Sovereignty and Governance. Foot health research with and for First Nations Peoples must have data being controlled by and accessible to First Nations Peoples, and data must be relevant to, and respect First Nations self-determined interests and governance <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(86,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">87,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">93)</ref>. Facilitating this, non-Indigenous researchers need to yield space in research, develop cultural humility and anti-racist skill sets, and support First Nations leadership to tell First Nations stories utilising First Nations ways of working in data management <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(86)</ref>. Foot health research with and for First Nations Peoples can then deliver outcomes meeting the needs, values, and aspirations of First Nations Peoples as evaluated by First Nations Peoples.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data analysis</head><p>First Nations-led ways of working in data analysis included all transcripts being anonymised, (identifiable only by participant number and First Nations/non-Indigenous voice) and transcribed verbatim by researchers manually. This better immersed researchers in data, improved their understanding and comprehension of phrasing and meanings of words used across many diverse First Nations, and removed impacts of software erroneously analysing data specific to First Nations languages, places, and foot care. For rigour and trustworthiness, ways of working included peer debriefing in code recording, 2-way learning, being reflexive, and having themes cross-checked by a First Nations researcher to identify areas of potential bias and to determine the reliability of the data interpretation <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(58,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">94)</ref>. Transcriptions and field notes were read, categorised, and inductively coded by a non-Indigenous researcher (JG) and were then reviewed by a First Nations researcher to minimise bias and cross-cultural misinterpretation. Ways of working placed a non-Indigenous researcher with existing relationships with First Nations leadership and a more developed culturally responsive and anti-racist skillset (as judged by First Nations Peoples) in this role. The non-Indigenous researcher (JG) additionally had experience in both mainstream and First Nations foot health services and research, as well as experience working on Wiradjuri and Darkinjung Country. Aboriginal PAR made it clearly understood that transcribing work is not a task that an inexperienced, unfamiliar non-Indigenous researcher can just walk into. It is also noted that multiple raters improve consistency between raw data and researcher interpretation in a phenomenological study <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">(95,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">96)</ref>. Preliminary analysis commenced with contextualisation of data by open coding <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(71,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">72,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">97)</ref>, generating an initial broad coding framework. With agreement upon the framework from the research team, coding then progressed iteratively with new coded material being discussed at regular intervals and regrouped and/or condensed into categories as new data were gathered. Analytic induction utilised inductive reasoning and constant comparison method to identify common and overarching themes and perform thematic analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(75,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">(98)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">(99)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">(100)</ref>. All authors agreed upon the final themes and thematic analysis included identifying similarities and differences within and between the interviews and extraction of relevant quotes. Demographic data was managed using Microsoft Excel. Having multiple researchers involved in teaching, learning, and implementing ways of working, and being transparent in analytical processes, produced more robust and trusted research outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(71,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">101,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">102)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ethics approval</head><p>Ethical approval was granted by The Aboriginal Health and Medical Research Council (1376/18) and the University of Newcastle Human Research Ethics Committee (approval No. H-2018 0035).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>The primary aim of this study was to document the development and implementation of First Nations-led, culturally responsive ways of working in foot health research in a cross-sectional qualitative study. This discussion is reflective of the process undertaken when privileging Aboriginal PAR and empowering First Nations leadership and ways of working in foot health research to create third spaces of combined knowledges <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">(103)</ref>. As a guiding paper, this discussion names First Nations leadership of work across all levels as the key requirement in redistributing power to create an authentic First Nations-led co-designed research space. Empowered First Nations leadership may inform ways of working in foot health research which directs both teaching and practice, whilst rebutting Western hegemony and scientific racism and leading the way for change. First Nations-led co-design is a tool for social justice <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">(104,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">105)</ref> and in healthcare can reduce racism and improve access through its decolonising methods and strategically anti-racist approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43)</ref>. There are specific requirements for such research process and there are very clear take home messages for foot health researchers from this work. Ways of being for non-Indigenous foot health researchers need to come from a place of cultural humility <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">(106)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b105">(107)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b106">(108)</ref>. As culturally humble, supportive non-Indigenous researchers may better reposition power, prioritise First Nations-led ways of knowing, being, and doing, and position one's non-Indigenous self to begin learning, unlearning, and relearning. Time needs to be taken by non-Indigenous researchers for work on self, where humility is fundamentally about recognising one's own non-Indigenous systemic privilege and power, the harm and trauma it can cause, and the need to relinquish it so that it may be repositioned power prioritising First Nations-led ways. Non-Indigenous researchers need to take time to become comfortable sitting with discomfort, for being prepared to be self-critical and uncomfortable through the learning, unlearning, and relearning, and to position any discomfort as negligible to that felt by First Nations Peoples impacted by scientific racism since 1788. Time also needs to be taken by non-Indigenous researchers to build trusting, mutually beneficial, two-way learning relationships with Communities, who then lead and advise them during process <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">(109)</ref>. As required for this work, time needs to be prioritised for learning from and with Communities on how to interact in culturally responsive ways. This needs to occur whilst being respectful of First Nations Peoples' time and competing priorities <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b108">110)</ref> and without increasing colonial load <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">(111)</ref> placed upon First Nations Peoples. Non-Indigenous foot health researchers need to work to restore trust in process that aspires equity in foot health research contributing to equality in overall health outcomes across all First Nations. Such ways of working need to be considerate of the impacts of history <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b110">112)</ref>. To assume that gradual inclusion of First Nations epistemology, ontology, and axiology <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46)</ref> on Western academic terms and under Western academic control will change systems which discriminate against First Nations Peoples is futile hope; whilst being complacent is being complicit. Citing the ongoing 'racial violence within the Australian health system' <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">(113)</ref> and cycle of 'Closing the Gap' policy failures, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b111">113,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b112">114)</ref> it will take real non-Indigenous accomplices and change makers <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">(115)</ref> in places of foot health research to develop skills in ways of working which will rewrite design, implementation, and evaluation of foot health systems. Intellectual terra nullius <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(31)</ref> powered by scientific racism has removed First Nations science, research, and ways of knowing, being, and doing from foot health systems and colonising scientific racism in the foot health space is ongoing. Internationally, the thrifty gene hypothesis, formally rejected in 2011, is an example of ongoing failed scientific racism which proposed Indigenous Peoples were genetically predisposed to Type 2 diabetes <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">(116,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b115">117)</ref>. With implications of manifesting flawed conceptualisation locally, such victim-blaming scientific racism ignores impacts of colonisation being bad for your health <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30)</ref>, ignores racism impacting overall health and wellbeing <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b116">118)</ref>, and ignores displacement from Country and its successful ongoing health paradigm as causes of poorer Indigenous health outcomes; including diabetes-related foot disease. Such erroneous work, and its subsequent dissemination by Western academia, contributes to deflection of root cause of health inequities away from systemic racism, and to ongoing exploitation and harm in ways of doing foot health research. Decolonisation <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(46)</ref> relational to the way we value research, methods, and outcomes, and in addition, to the ways we work in foot health is required. First Nations-led research takes back self-determined ways of working, empowers, heals, and centres culture in action and process, as well as in outcomes of work <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46)</ref>. Western hierarchy of evidence ranks cross-sectional qualitative study design relatively low <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">(119)</ref>. However, this work raises contention that the voices, results, and discussion here and those amplified, presented, and discussed using Indigenous methodologies in foot health research led by First Nations experts, may be more impactful and meaningful than mainstream Randomised Control Trial reporting. This work questions; Is non-Indigenous, mainstream value set for research working? Therefore, First Nations-led co-design of foot health research becomes foundational to informing non-Indigenous researchers in particular, across many mainstream study designs, how to do it properly, how to work right ways, and how to work different ways, to achieve different outcomes; good foot health services providing good foot health outcomes with and for First Nations Peoples. The simple explainer here is that this is hard work. Hard work is required from non-Indigenous researchers in undertaking ongoing cultural responsiveness learning, unlearning, and relearning, and part of this education is understanding that it is hard work for First Nations Peoples to teach and guide without process contributing to excessive colonial load. Colonial load unfairly burdens First Nations Peoples with having to justify First Nations ways in colonised processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">(111)</ref> and is compounded by time spent, emotional energy expended, triggering content, and non-Indigenous ignorance <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(43)</ref>. This discussion therefore is explicit in positioning non-Indigenous researchers as the people needing to take on the hard work. This study informs readers to better understand process and the relationships behind it, as well as nuances. Readers may rethink accepted process, and how they interpret, use, and place value on results. Without centring First Nations voices and worldviews, without self-reflection of positioning to colonial power, and without understanding the biased conditions of ongoing colonisation <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">(120)</ref>, foot health research and its methods will maintain Western hegemony, inequities in health systems, and unequal health outcomes for First Nations Peoples. Non-Indigenous foot health researchers can be part of the solution or can be part of the problem.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Strengths and Limitations</head><p>Strengths are that this research benefited the participants and First Nations Communities by privileging their voices and ways of working in research with and for. The research demonstrates capacity strengthening for both First Nations and non-Indigenous individuals from involvement in the work, developing implementation of Aboriginal PAR, and empowering authentic co-design in the research space. Non-Indigenous researchers improving skills in taking time, deep listening, supporting First Nations leadership, challenging the norms of systemic research inequities, and developing decolonising ways of doing research which redistribute power are further strengths of this work. Importantly, everyone involved in the research had opportunities to learn from each other, to experience First Nations ways of working, to display cultural humility <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">(106,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b105">107)</ref> and selfreflexivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b119">(121)</ref>, and to develop skills towards creating a culturally responsive research space <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">55)</ref> where First Nations Peoples are welcomed, believed, supported, and do not experience racism in any form <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b120">122,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b121">123)</ref>. A strength of this research was its negotiated rights to access First Nations existing cultural and intellectual property, but a major limitation exists in the need for improved measures and mechanisms protecting First Nations ownership of data research created and seeing to First Nations Peoples having control over the collection and management of research materials <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(66)</ref>. Ways of Western university dominance of a PhD project, of which this work is a part, need to be addressed to demonstrate true power redistribution facilitating First Nations self-determined decision making regarding caring for, accessing, storing, protecting, and controlling the use of data for the entirety of its lifecycle <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">(124)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>This work documents First Nations-led ways of working in foot health research and brings First Nations-led ways of working in cross-sectional qualitative study design to published literature. This study provides qualified voiced lived experience which foot health research must listen to and receive direction and learning from. Since invasion, foot health research has been socialised into dominant colonial research paradigms conjuring positionality of First Nations Peoples as a problem, rather than working with and for First Nations Peoples. Authentic First Nations-led co-design of research delivers ways of working to change systems of oppression. Anti-racist and cultural capability skill sets of those working in mainstream foot health research can develop to build culturally responsive spaces for First Nations Peoples to approach, use, and lead in, and which inform of culturally safer solutions to foot dis-ease as judged by First Nations Peoples. Culturally safer services need to be founded on decolonised research evidence led by First Nations Peoples. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples' access to healthcare is reduced by lack of culturally safe service <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b123">125)</ref>. In Communities where provision of healthcare, including foot care is culturally safe, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples access services more frequently and have better health outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b124">126)</ref>.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>research is guided by Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies (AIATSIS) leadership in First Nations ethics and research mandated by the AIATSIS Act (1989) (59). The AIATSIS Code of Ethics for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Research (60) foregrounds principles of Indigenous self-determination, Indigenous leadership, impact and value, and sustainability and accountability in ways of doing First Nations research (60). The AIATSIS Code of Ethics for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Research is informed by the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (61) and underpins National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) ethical guidelines for research with First Nations Peoples. Two NHMRC guidelines; 'Ethical conduct in research with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and communities: Guidelines for researchers and stakeholders 2018' (62) and 'Keeping research on track II 2018' (63) were developed including The Lowitja Institute, AIATSIS, and NHMRC Indigenous Research Ethics Guidelines (IREG) Review Working Committee (64). These two guidelines further inform ways of doing research with and for First Nations Peoples. They describe a central core value of Spirit and integrity surrounded by core values of what researchers need to learn and then foreground in all work: Cultural continuity, Equity, Reciprocity, Respect, and Responsibility (62, 63). With research led by, and being with and for Darkinyung and Wiradjuri Peoples, ethics approval for work which centred place was sought from the Aboriginal Health and Medical Research Council of NSW (AH&amp;MRC) Human Research Ethics Committee.</figDesc></figure>

First Nations Peoples were leaving healthy footprints on Darkinjung Country and Wiradjuri Country, were researching foot health, and were surviving Western hegemony long before this study eventuated. VC worked with and for Dr Matthew West (Wiradjuri), individuals, families, and Communities on Darkinjung Country and Wiradjuri Country for years before this work began, building trusting relationships and demonstrating reciprocity. More recently JG was invited into this place-based process of learning, unlearning, and relearning. Darkinyung Community, Wiradjuri Community, First Nations Advisory Group, and VC conceived the study. SG and JG each contributed to the study design and developed the interview guide.
