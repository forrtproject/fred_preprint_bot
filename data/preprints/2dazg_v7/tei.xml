We that the risk-free rate reflects the expected inflation effect, and that the inflation risk reflects the unexpected inflation effect or the investment opportunity cost. To simplify the formulas, we also examine if the two returns can be computed independently. We employ two factors to model the risk-free rate, which the market expects the current monetary policy to bring towards the neutral level over a certain period. The 4-factor models include a risk constant over maturity to capture the depreciation cost of inter-bank short-term lending. We thus use different models to split T-bill returns into the risk and the risk-free rate with repeated trials to minimize the prediction errors, thereby solving the model factors.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>We argue that a payment's risk approaches zero as maturity approaches zero,<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> and that the central bank's short-term rate best captures the risk-free rate. Intuitively, the more distant a payment, the less informed the risk, thus the riskier the payment. This appears to be the most plausible explanation of the literature evidence that a treasury bond's yield is positively associated with maturity (see, e.g., Mishkin, p. 124, 2016). This also challenges conventional "risk-free" rate, as captured by T-bill yield that actually decreases over time. Therefore, conventional "risk-free" rate cannot be risk-free, because the competing argument is obviously doubtful-a bill's risk increases, or remains the same, whereas the "risk-free" rate declines, over maturity. An increase in the central bank's short-term rate, for instance, reduces a T-bill's value. Since the risk approaches zero at maturity, the return immediately prior to maturity is the most risk-free. The difference between the rate at the start and that at maturity, therefore, represents the difference between the risks of the two points of T-bill maturity. The short-term rate of central bank, where maturity is as short as one day, therefore, best reflects the risk-free rate of various assets. The riskfree rate can be seemingly higher than T-bill yield when the market expects the interest rate to decrease soon. Obviously, a T-bill holding can lose thousands of times more than inter-bank shortterm lending in case of an interest rate increase, which casts serious doubt on conventional riskfree rate.</p><p>We treat a country's T-bill risk as the macrorisk that largely reflects the inflation risk in the country. To find the microrisk of a corporate asset, we have to compute the risk-free rate and the macrorisk of T-bills in the country. We calibrate the T-bill risk as a one-year payment's risk to be comparable across assets, modeling the linear changes in risk and risk-free rate. A corporate payment with a face value carries the T-bill risk that may cause noise in the payment's micro-risk (i.e., default risk or firm risk). <ref type="bibr">2</ref> This study delineates the risk and risk-free rate of US and Canada T-bills, accounting for the future changes as expected by the market. For instance, US and Canada treasury bonds with long maturity in May 2024 yield significantly lower than the risk-free rate because the market expects the central banks to start rate decreases in the second half of the year.</p><p>We also examine if we can assume that the risk and the risk-free returns are independent of each other, which significantly simplify, thereby instrumenting, the formulas. To solve the model factors, we use repeated trials to minimize the mean absolute value (MAV) of prediction errors. In addition, our continuously compounding return of a constant rate 𝑟(𝑡) is given by: 3 𝑌 ̂𝑇(𝑟) = ∫ (𝑒 𝑟(𝑡) -1)𝑑𝑡 = 𝑇(𝑒 𝑟 -1) 𝑇 0</p><p>.</p><p>(</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">)<label>1</label></formula><p>where T is maturity, and r is the return rate.</p><p>Our rates are different from conventional continuously compounding return of a constant rate:</p><p>𝑌 ̂𝑇(𝑟) = ∫ 𝑟𝑒 𝑟𝑡 𝑑𝑡 = 𝑒 𝑟𝑇 𝑇 0</p><p>.</p><p>(2)</p><p>As a result, annual rate in this study is also different from conventional annual rate. A constant rate estimated in this study should be slightly higher than a conventional annual rate, as our continuous compounding rate appear to be a simple rate that never compounding. Readers may suggest that we transform our rates into conventional ones. Unfortunately, our evidence indicates that conventional rates probably mix the risk with the risk-free rate since a partially continuously compounding (henceforth, PCC) strategy reduces the models' power in predicting T-bill returns.</p><p>As the fundamentals of our asset risk theory, this study argues that a payment's risk approaches zero as maturity approaches zero, and that the central bank's rate best reflects the riskfree rate, thereby addressing a conventional misconception about the risk-free rate. The results strongly support our modeling of the risk and the risk-free rate. Our first round of trials yields an MAV above 15%, in contrast to a mean MAV 0.7% from the 4-factor independence model (see, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>), which suggests that the model on average explains 99.3% of the T-bill returns. Thus, the model represents the gateway to asset risk analyses. We strongly believe that mean MAV can drop below 0.3% with advanced software developed.</p><p>The remainder of this study is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the 4-factor and 3factor models. Section 3 describes the computation methodology. Section 4 presents the results from examining the yield of recent US and Canada T-bills. Section 5 concludes.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">The linearly moving risk-free rate</head><p>For US and Canada T-bills in early 2024, we observe that a T-bill's yield is negatively (positively) related to maturity when maturity is shorter (longer) than 5 years. The yield pattern suggests that the market expects the monetary policy to bring the current interest rate 𝑟 𝑓0 to the neutral level 𝑟 𝑓𝑛 . Also, we expect that the market cannot predict the direction of the next monetary policy. Therefore, the linearly moving risk-free rate can be specified as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">𝑟𝑓(𝑡) = { 𝑟 𝑓0 + (𝑟 𝑓𝑛 -𝑟 𝑓0 )𝑡 𝑇 𝑚 𝑟 𝑓𝑛 , (𝑡 &gt; 𝑇 𝑚 ) .

In particular, focus first on changing the other model factors to minimize MAV when examining these points. For more advanced analysis, one can similarly test each of the other model factors over the possible range of the factor.</p><p>importantly, the model similarly explains 99.1% of the returns on including on the 13 dates of US T-bills reported in Nie (2023). The Canada data we extracted from ycharts.com yield a mean MAV of 1.4%, which appear to be noisier than the US data we obtained from the US Fed website. In particular, we observe that the results from the 4-factor (in)dependence model have a mean MAV of (1.1%)1.2%, supporting that on average the 4-factor independence model have stronger power in predicting T-bill yields than the 4-factor dependence model. We also find that the 3-factor (in)dependence model yields a mean MAV of (2.0%)1.3%. will move the effective rate of 5.33% on 3 May 2024 to the neutral rate of (3.40%)3.92% in (2.7)1.9 years, and move the rate of 4.33% on 11 Feb 2025 to the neutral of (3.63%)4.09% in (1.9)1.1 years. The 4-factor (in)dependence model also predicts that Bank of Canada will bring the effective rate of 5.02% on 3 May 2024 to the neutral rate of (2.90%)3.23% in (2.4)1.9 years, and move the effective rate of 3.02% on 11 Feb 2025 to the neutral rate of (2.57%)2.64% in (2.0)0.86 years. The T-bill risk, the interbank lending depreciation rate, and the neutral rate predicted by the 4-factor independence and dependence models are qualitatively similar in this study. The results in Nie (2023) probably support that the independence model performs better than the dependence model, as 13 dates represents a more comprehensive analysis. As expected, the results suggest that the 3-factor models have weaker power in explaining T-bill returns.

This important finding indicates that conventional rates probably entangle the risk with the risk-free rates. For four reasons, we do not report the results from the 4-factor dependence model. First, we do not expect that the dependence model can possibly outperform the independence model. Second, as the dependence model is more difficult to handle, the manual computation process can easily involve hidden mistakes. Third, the 4-factor dependence model generally yields higher MAV with the PCC. Fourth, the results may inconclusive as the model examines T-bills on only 4 days.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>[Please insert Tables 2 to 4 about here]</head><p>The return independence can significantly simplify the formulas in our future asset risk analyses. The results support that the 4-factor independence model explains 99.3% of US bill returns after removing the PCC. Including the PCC, the model only predicts 98.6% of Canada Tbill returns and 99.1% of US T-bill returns initially reported in this paper and 13 days' data in Nie (2023). To sum up, the evidence strongly supports our argument that a country's T-bill risk approaches zero as maturity approaches zero. As illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>, we find that a T-bill's risk approaches zero as maturity approaches zero, and that the risk-free rate linearly moves toward the neutral level rfn in Tm years. A T-bill's risk reflects the return in excess of the central bank's rate after accounting for the baseline cost of inter-bank lending, although a T-bill's yield can be lower than the current effective rate when the market expects the latter to significantly decline in the near future.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusion</head><p>This study proposes that the central bank's short-term interest rate best captures the riskfree rate of various assets, and that a payment's risk approaches zero as maturity approaches zero.</p><p>We measure the risk as a one-year payment's risk to be comparable across assets. The results strongly support our argument that the central bank's short-term rate best reflects the risk-free rate of the country's various assets. The T-bill risk reflects the inflation risk or the macrorisk for assets with a face value denominated by the depreciating currency, acting as inflation premium for assets without a face value. We argue that a payment's risk approaches zero as maturity approaches zero. The delineation of the risk and the risk-free rate in this study represents the gateway to the risk of various assets. Since T-bill risk captures a country's inflation risk, a corporate bond's risk in excess of the T-bill risk is a firm's default risk, which also approaches zero as maturity approaches zero.</p><p>We expect that the risk-free rate captures the expected inflation effect while the risk reflects the unexpected inflation effect or the investment opportunity cost, supporting that asset value accounting for the risk-free return, which includes interbank short-term rate and the constant risk or the depreciation cost of the interbank lending rate, represents nondepreciating asset value over time. According to our knowledge, our models and the computation methodology have never been used in any mathematical or financial literatures. Without developing the 4-factor independence model into software, we cannot examine the noise of the risk and the risk-free rate, which follows a blended normal distribution as proposed in Nie (2023).</p></div>

The 4-factor model additionally includes a depreciation cost constant over maturity to capture the cost of inter-bank lending. The 4-factor independence model examines how the return independence assumption impacts the model's power in predicting T-bill returns. Thus, the 3-and 4-factor models separate US and Canada T-bill yield into the risk and the risk-free rate. We use US and Canada T-bill yield on 3 May 2024 and 11 Feb 2025 to solve the model factors. In particular, we minimize the prediction errors with repeated trials. The 4-factor independence model excluding the PCC explain 99.3% ofUS T-bill yield on average. We also observe that the depreciation cost constant over bond maturity significantly reduces the prediction errors for both dependence and independence models. The models can predict the differently number of years for the central bank to move the current effective rate to the neutral level, they generally predict inflation risk and neutral rate similarly.</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>To this end, we use repeated trials to minimize the mean errors to solve the model factors 𝑇 𝑚 , 𝑟 𝑓 , 𝑟 𝑓𝑛 , and, if applicable, 𝑟 𝑠 . To be a solution candidate, we require that any change in any one of the factors cannot reduce the MAV by 10 -8 (which we can set to 10 -9 or 10 -10 with software developed. An experimenter may miss some potential candidates, manually computing experimenter is more likely to miss some candidates when shortcuts are critical to the process. To analyze the impact of such failure, our experiments are focused on the 4-factor independence model with US T-bill data on 2 Aug 2024 when the model generally reveals high MAVs. To analyze the impact of such failure, Table1reports the candidates that our 4-factor independence model produces.7  We observe that the T-bill risk 𝑟 𝑓 , the most important factor of our estimation, mostly remains unchanged although 𝑇 𝑚 and/or MAV show different values. However, the T-bill risk decreases by about 20% for the highest MAV, which provides an important clue for prospect software developers. 8 Therefore, we can safely use a solution that even fails to obtain the lowest MAV. A rule of thumb is that the mean MAV is below 2.0% for 9 T-bills for instance. For US T-bills with the 4-factor independence model using formula (12) rather than (10), as reported in Table4, the mean MAV from our manual computation is 0.78%, which can drop below 0.3% with advanced software developed. According to our experience, a reasonable 𝑇 𝑚 is between 0.5 to 2.5 years. To locate a solution efficiently, for example for US and Canada Tbills, we set the start point as: 𝑇 𝑚 = 0.5 years, rf = 25 bp, 𝑟 𝑓𝑛 = 2.5%, and 𝑟 𝑠 = 4 bp. Or alternatively, we can use the previous solution as the start point of the current experiment.</figDesc><table><row><cell>𝜕 2 𝑀𝐴𝑉</cell></row><row><cell>𝜕𝑇 𝑚</cell></row></table><note><p><p><p><p>thereby missing the candidate that has the lowest MAV.

Generally, a candidate's MAV monotonically increases if any one of the factors moves away from the point.</p>However, this may not the case for 𝑇 𝑚 as MAV can decrease over some periods of T.
