<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This study examines how rising income inequality has been impacting individuals' belief in merit-based success, using three decades of survey data from 39 advanced capitalist democracies. Challenging the seminal finding of a "paradox of inequality," we find no evidence of a positive effect of inequality on meritocratic beliefs across countries. Instead, we identify a substantively moderate but robustly negative effect of inequality on perceptions of meritocracy from within-country changes over time: as inequality rises, citizens' belief in meritocracy declines. We further uncover that inequality does not merely induce a mean shift, but affects the shape of the distribution of meritocracy beliefs insofar as we find the proportion of sceptical perceptions of meritocratic realities to be increasing with higher levels of inequality. Our findings thus suggest that growing inequality undermines citizens' trust in procedural fairness and contributes to an increased polarisation of attitudes and beliefs at the heart of open societies.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Meritocracythe idea that citizens can attain social status through their own merit and achievementsis understood as a constitutive cornerstone of liberal, open societies <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Popper, 1945;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Parsons, 1971)</ref>. When meritocratic principles are guiding individual attainment, a liberal social order offers a promise of procedural fairness that individual talent, skill and effort will be rewarded without undue interference of heritage, tradition or social origin. However, the steep rise in economic inequality many of these liberal societies witnessed over the past decades <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Stiglitz, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Piketty, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Atkinson, 2015)</ref> poses a fundamental challenge to this normative ideal, as it may distort the pathways through which merit is recognized and rewarded. When growing inequality is contributing to structural barriers that advantage the already privileged, the notion of meritocracy is put in jeopardy. To take educational attainment as an example: as inequality rises, family resources are getting more unequally distributed, thus equipping better-off families with additional resources which they can invest in their offspring's education. In contrast, lowincome children are increasingly attending segregated, underfunded public schools and lack opportunities for advancement <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Mayer, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Reardon, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Putnam, 2016)</ref>, which ultimately restricts the level of social mobility.</p><p>Against this backdrop, the seminal study of Jonathan <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Mijs (2021)</ref> has garnered significant scholarly attention as it identified a "paradoxical" relationship between economic inequality and individuals' belief in meritocracy. Going against sociological folk wisdom, <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Mijs (2021)</ref> found that inequality and belief in meritocracy empirically go "hand in hand," so that citizens tend to more strongly believe in meritocracy in more economically unequal societies. To explain his findings, Mijs advanced the argument that inequality would tend to socially insulate individuals along economic lines, thus limiting citizens' everyday interactions with people from different socioeconomic backgrounds and preventing them from fully grasping the extent of inequality in society. As a result, Mijs argued that people would be more likely to interpret societal success and unequal outcomes as meritocratically deserved, thereby reinforcing their belief in meritocracy.</p><p>However, the "paradox of inequality" has not gone uncontested. On a theoretical level, the very same segregation mechanism that <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Mijs (2021)</ref> invokes to explain his findings has been at the heart of classical sociological conflict theoryexcept, as we also discuss below, that increasing social insulation is assumed to foster structuralist beliefs about attainment in that perspective. In addition, recent comparative evidence has also <ref type="bibr">challenged Mijs' (2021)</ref> finding on an empirical level by showing that cross-country differences in inequality do not influence individuals' belief in meritocracy. Moreover, recent single-country studies have also found limited support for the supposed "paradox of inequality" at either the regional or local level <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Morris et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Oetke et al., 2023)</ref>, even as the segregation mechanism should most evidently be playing out there.</p><p>In view of this conflicting evidence, the present study revisits the substantive question of whether or not economic inequality is shaping citizens' belief in meritocracy. We adopt a comprehensive cross-country design by drawing on survey data from three internationally comparable survey programmes. We significantly expand on Mijs' seminal work by incorporating an additional wave of ISSP data and by integrating closely related data from the European and World Value Surveys (EVS/WVS), which ultimately allows us to leverage data from some 175,000 respondents surveyed over an observation window that extends over more than three decades  in 39 advanced capitalist democracies. We analyse this data with a set of hybrid multilevel linear regression models in order to assess whether and how economic inequality is affecting citizens' perceptions of meritocracy.</p><p>Furthermore, we contend that current research may fall short in understanding fully how inequality impacts citizens' beliefs by relying on overall (average) effects of inequality. Drawing on competing theoretical perspectives, we rather anticipate that inequality exerts a heterogeneous effect, i.e. affecting citizens' belief in meritocracy to varying degrees and in varying directions. Employing recently developed hybrid multilevel multiscale ordered logit models, we examine to what extent inequality alters the distribution of beliefs and thus advance the scope of the current debate.</p><p>Challenging the "paradox of inequality" <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Mijs, 2021)</ref>, our findings provide robust evidence that rising inequality does erode citizens' faith in meritocracy, thus confirming standard conflict theory as well as aligning with and further corroborating the recent empirical findings provided by <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bartram (2023)</ref>. Like <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bartram (2023)</ref>, we find that changes in inequality over time are associated with decreasing belief in meritocratic allocation, but unlike Bartram, who used a separate item on the perceived legitimacy of wage differentials that is available in the ESS, we observe this "non-paradoxical" relationship between inequality and meritocratic beliefs right for the standard measures of respondents' perception of meritocracy that had also been used in Mijs' original research.</p><p>Beyond the general, yet moderate decline in belief in meritocracy, novel modelling techniques allow us to further uncover that inequality significantly alters the shape of the distribution of citizens' meritocratic beliefs. Specifically, we find that inequality is exerting a polarising effect on citizens' beliefs in meritocracy, whereby the spread of the belief distribution increases because the proportion of intensely sceptical attitudes is growing with rising inequality, whereas there is hardly any systematic effect of inequality in the upper (i.e. meritocracy-supportive) parts of the distribution. This polarisation of meritocratic beliefs is partly reflected in a cross-level interaction between inequality and respondents' social class, yet class or other measures of respondent socioeconomic status are clearly insufficient to fully tap the sources of the polarisation of meritocratic beliefs that we observe in the data. Before we discuss these results more fully, we first provide the theoretical background to our study and then explain our statistical approach and research methodology.</p></div>

Empirical studies have demonstrated how inequality is affecting social mobility <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Andrews and Leigh, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Corak, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bloome, 2015)</ref>, social cohesion <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Uslaner and Brown, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Lancee and Van de Werfhorst, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Schröder and Neumayr, 2023)</ref>, and democratic orientations <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Christmann, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Goubin and Hooghe, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bienstman et al., 2024)</ref>, yet relative to the social science evidence, popular concern remains astonishingly subdued <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Kenworthy and McCall, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Trump, 2018)</ref>. One key explanation put forward in the literature is that people perceive inequality as fair and legitimate if outcomes follow a function of meritocratic allocation <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Kluegel and Smith, 1981;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Reynolds and Xian, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Larsen, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Trump, 2020)</ref>.</p><p>While a growing strand of research has indeed documented that meritocratic beliefs serve as a vital legitimization of inequality, Jonathan Mijs' (2021) seminal finding of a "paradox of inequality"whereby inequality fuels rather than depresses beliefs in meritocracyhas recently added a novel twist to the literature. To explain why inequality would paradoxically be generating "the social conditions for its legitimization" <ref type="bibr">(Mijs, 2021, p. 12)</ref>, Mijs has been referring to <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Allport's (1954)</ref> classical intergroup contact theory to argue that economic inequality is socially insulating people along economic fault lines. Then, increasing segregation is leaving people surrounded by people of similar socio-economic backgrounds and is creating an informational feedback loop "where more inequality paradoxically leads them to experience less of it" <ref type="bibr">(Mijs, 2021, p. 31)</ref>.</p><p>The evidence in favour of a "paradox of inequality" has been coming from an analysis of three waves of 1987-2009 ISSP data from 23 countries, where <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Mijs (2021)</ref> finds that people in more unequal societies also believe more strongly in meritocracy, while within-country changes of inequality over time do not show any effect on meritocratic beliefs. This lack of a within-relationship between inequality and meritocratic beliefs may have been a first reason to question the reality of the "paradox of inequality", yet the paradox of inequality has not gone uncontested on other grounds as well. A recent study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bartram (2023)</ref>, for example, failed to validate Mijs' (2021) findings. Attempting to replicate Mijs' original analysis, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bartram (2023)</ref> finds that original results appear highly sensitive to the selection of countries in the ISSP data, as once the case of Polandas an extreme outlier with respect to changes in inequalitywas dropped from the analysis the results did not hold anymore. Furthermore, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bartram (2023)</ref> also failed to replicate the "paradox of inequality" with the European Social Survey (ESS) data, where he found that higher levels of economic inequality within countries over time actually depress the perceived legitimacy of wage differentials.</p><p>Likewise, single country studies that recently investigated the role of economic inequality on meritocratic beliefs at the local and regional level also lend limited support to the paradox of inequality at best. In direct contrast to the "paradox of inequality", <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Oetke et al. (2023)</ref> identify a negative relationship between district-level segregation and meritocratic beliefs using data from the German Socio-Economic Panel. Moreover, <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Oetke et al. (2023)</ref> found that individuals in districts where highstatus households are isolated place less importance on hard work as a means of advancement, so that -in contrast to Mijs' (2021) segregation perspectivethe most privileged individuals those in exclusive, high-status environments do seem aware, at least implicitly, that their advantages are not solely the result of their hard work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Relative power theory</head><p>An alternative theoretical perspective that better fits with observations like those of <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Oetke et al. (2023)</ref> is relative power theory. This perspective posits that rising inequality is enhancing the power of the wealthy and those in economically powerful positions to shape public discourse and to spread ideological beliefs that are beneficial to them <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Goodin and Dryzek, 1980)</ref>. The disadvantaged in society, in turn, tend to internalize these beliefsnot only to justify the system, but also to self-justify their own position, providing them with the prospect of eventually escaping the feelings of powerlessness <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Solt et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Morris et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">McCoy et al., 2013)</ref>. Meritocratic convictions may be particularly strong during periods of economic growth, as proposed in the 'tunnel effect' by <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Hirschman and Rothschild (1973)</ref>, when rising inequality is tolerated and trust in meritocratic processes is sustained by the prospect of future personal economic advancement. This process ultimately also leads to a stronger societal endorsement of meritocratic principles under conditions of high inequality, yet here the effect results because the meritocratic beliefs of less privileged citizens are converging to those of their more privileged compatriots.</p><p>Evidence in favour of relative power theory comes from <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Solt et al. (2016)</ref>, for example, who use the US Religious Landscape Survey to demonstrate that higher levels of county-level inequality are associated with stronger beliefs in meritocracy, and that this association is observed among low-to middle-income respondents only. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Morris et al. (2022)</ref> report comparable findings for the UK: Using data from the British Household Panel Study, they show that low-income individuals in more unequal localities are more inclined to be embrace meritocracy, reaching endorsement levels similar to those of high-income individuals.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Conflict perspectives</head><p>Relative to Mijs' segregation perspective and to relative power theory that both imply the expectation that higher levels of inequality will be accompanied by more meritocratic beliefs in the citizenry, sociological conflict perspectives have traditionally implied the opposite relationship. From a conflict perspective, inequality exposes less resourceful citizens to structural barrierssuch as limited access to education or resourceful neighbourhoodsthat prevent them from climbing up the social ladder despite their best efforts. As their lived experiences increasingly contradict the idea of meritocracy, they are likely to grow sceptical of the belief that success is based solely on individual effort and talent, and instead consider structural factors more important, such as coming from a wealthy family <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(McCall et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Zhu et al., 2022)</ref>. Consequently, studies like <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Kang and Park (2024)</ref> show that individuals who are living in more unequal districts tend to be more pessimistic about their prospects for advancing their socioeconomic status through hard work, and that this association is especially strong among economically disadvantaged individuals. With a view towards social psychological processes, social identity theories have also argued that lack of socioeconomic success is posing a threat to individuals' self-esteem, so that citizens at the lower end of the income distribution would be psychologically predisposed to use structuralist attributions to shield themselves from self-stigmatization (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Roex et al., 2019)</ref>.</p><p>However, scholars in the conflict tradition not only highlight these personal contradictions, but also argue that rising inequality is making economic disparities more salient, and may thus be triggering higher levels of class consciousness (in the Marxian sense of 'class for itself') <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Newman et al., 2015)</ref>. As a result, people become more aware of their own position within society and evaluate their position more critically in relation to the positions of others. Inequality, therefore, may lead disadvantaged individuals to rationalize their own position by attributing it to factors outside of their control, and to lose faith in meritocracy ('activated disillusionment', <ref type="bibr">Newman et al., 2015, p. 329)</ref>. Conversely, well-off individuals are expected to be more inclined to embrace the concept of meritocracy, as they may use it to justify and preserve their privileged position and to reduce cognitive dissonance caused by the high levels of inequality and poverty they encounter in their everyday lives ('activated loyalty') <ref type="bibr">(Newman et al., 2015, p. 330)</ref>. In line with these arguments, <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Newman et al. (2015)</ref> find that meritocratic beliefs are significantly stratified by income among U.S. respondents residing in unequal counties, compared to those in more egalitarian counties, with low-income individuals being more inclined to reject and high-income individuals more likely to endorse meritocracy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Hypotheses</head><p>At the risk of some oversimplification, we believe that it is possible to distil three characteristic predictions to summarize the main theoretical argument about the relationship between economic inequality and citizens' perceptions of meritocracy from each of the foregoing perspectives. Conceptually and empirically, we distinguish between main effects and dispersion effects. The former refer to shifts in the overall belief distribution, while the latter imply changes in the shape of the belief distribution.</p><p>The segregation mechanism put forward by Mijs (2021, also see Mijs &amp; Usmani 2024) predicts an overall positive effect of rising inequality on meritocratic beliefs. This effect arises because individuals lack social interaction with those from different socio-economic backgrounds, leading them into experiential feedback loops that make them more inclined to legitimize unequal outcomes as meritocratically deserved, rather than question their structural causes. Theoretically, the mechanism could operate either symmetrically or asymmetrically. On the one hand, the original study argues that individuals at both ends of the income distribution fail to grasp "the structural forces that make for inequality because they are increasingly unable to see it from their (isolated) position" <ref type="bibr">(Mijs, 2021, p. 12)</ref> and thus tend to seek individualist explanations for socio-economic achievement (and see Mijs &amp; Usmani 2024 for a formal model of the respective inferential processes). This claim finds some support by research on social capital that identifies a U-shaped relationship between class position and network homogeneity, indicating that individuals at both the lowest and highest social strata tend to have the most closed social networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Otero et al., 2021)</ref>. Such a symmetric effect would imply the absence of a dispersion effect of inequality and only result in an upward shift of the mean.</p><p>On the other hand, it seems at least equally plausible that segregation disproportionately narrows the perspective and awareness of privileged individuals, who become increasingly insulated from the harsh realities in the lower rungs of society. Those at the top may thus become less sensitive to structural forces of inequality and overly overoptimistic about the role of merit and personal agency in achieving societal success <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Edmiston, 2018)</ref>. Those at the bottom, however, despite similarly closed and homogeneous networks, are still on an everyday basis exposed to the different lifestyles and living circumstances of the privileged members of societywhether it is through direct social interactions in workplace or educational settings, healthcare institutions or indirectly via representations in the media. This form of asymmetric effect in our reading implies the presence of a polarizing dispersion effect of inequality, that is mainly driven by citizens at the top of the social hierarchy. The positive overall association would then mainly come about because inequality is making privileged citizens overly optimistic about meritocratic realities.</p><p>Relative power theory likewise predicts a positive association between inequality and beliefs in meritocracy, but sees the main mechanism being the internalisation of meritocratic beliefs among the disadvantaged, i.e. is offering the argument that the less privileged members of society are converging towards the views held by the more privileged strata under conditions of high inequality (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Goodin and Dryzek, 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Solt et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Morris et al., 2022)</ref>. Sociological conflict perspectives instead generally predict that high levels of inequality will depress citizens' belief in meritocracy, and they primarily see increasingly structuralist attributions in the lower strata as the main culprit (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Newman et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">McCall et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Zhu et al., 2022)</ref>.</p><p>We summarize these distinctive theoretical expectations in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>, and we now use these contrasting perspectives to guide our subsequent empirical analysis.</p><p>[INSERT TABLE <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1 HERE]</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Methodology and research design</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Data</head><p>To assess these theoretical expectations empirically, we draw on individuallevel survey data from three well-established cross-national survey programmes: the International Social Survey Programme (ISSP), the European Values Study (EVS), and the World Values Survey (WVS). From these data sources, we construct a harmonized database, consisting of four waves of <ref type="bibr">ISSP (1989</ref><ref type="bibr">ISSP ( , 1992</ref><ref type="bibr">ISSP ( , 2009</ref><ref type="bibr">ISSP ( , 2019) )</ref> (ISSP Research Group, 2024), one wave of the EVS (1990) (EVS, 2022), and five waves of the <ref type="bibr">WVS (1989</ref><ref type="bibr">WVS ( -1993</ref><ref type="bibr">WVS ( , 1994</ref><ref type="bibr">WVS ( -1998</ref><ref type="bibr">WVS ( , 2005</ref><ref type="bibr">WVS ( -2009</ref><ref type="bibr">WVS ( , 2010</ref><ref type="bibr">WVS ( -2014</ref><ref type="bibr">WVS ( , 2017</ref><ref type="bibr">WVS ( -2022</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Haerpfer et al., 2024)</ref>. We complement this data with country-level information on macroeconomic conditions obtained from the Standardized World Income Inequality Database <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Solt, 2020)</ref> and the World Development Indicators <ref type="bibr">(The World Bank, 2024)</ref>. Since our study focuses on advanced capitalist democracies, our country sample is comprised of 39 OECD and OECD candidate countries.<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> In total, our data encompasses over 175,000 individuals across 39 advanced capitalist democracies, spanning an observation window of more than three decades .</p><p>In the endeavour to identify the effect of economic inequality on meritocratic beliefs over appropriately expansive observation periods, our harmonization effort prioritized preserving as many historical data points across countries as possible, while maintaining consistent data quality. Although this harmonization approach naturally required certain compromises in the operationalization of variables over time across three surveys, we are confident that our final dataset offers the most comprehensive data basis to adequately evaluate the impact of economic inequality on meritocratic beliefs available to date, allowing us to leverage both significant cross-national and cross-temporal variation within countries over time. Given that we intend to primarily rely on over-time variation in inequality and meritocracy beliefs and on estimating multilevel regression models that incorporate country fixed effects, we restrict our analyses to those countries that have at least participated in two rounds of the ISSP or EVS/WVS surveys.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Variables</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dependent variable: Belief in meritocracy</head><p>Meritocratic beliefs are measured with two different variables coming from the ISSP and the EVS/WVS. The first variable is derived from three items from the ISSP's item battery "Getting ahead". Respondents were asked to rank the importance of several factors to get ahead in life from "Essential" to "Not important at all". For the belief in meritocracy, an index was calculated that captures respondents' importance of "hard work" to get ahead, ranging from 0 (not important at all) to 100 (essential), following the approach used in previous literature (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Larsen, 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Likewise, for the belief in structural inequalities, an index was constructed that grasps the importance respondents attributed to "coming from a wealthy family" and "knowing the right people," ranging from 0 to 100 as well. Acknowledging the ongoing debate about the multidimensionality of meritocratic beliefs <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Mijs, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Castillo et al., 2023)</ref>, our final analyses rely on an measure of overall belief in meritocracy as suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Reynolds and Xian (2014)</ref>. This composite measure calculates the difference between the two constructed indices, resulting in a range from 0 (low belief in meritocratic and high belief in non-meritocratic elements) to 100 (high belief in meritocratic and low belief in non-meritocratic elements).</p><p>Substantively, we argue that a strong or 'pure' belief in meritocracy involves, at least to a certain extent, rejecting the primary importance of non-meritocratic factors to determine success in life. By incorporating the relative weight respondents assign to both hard work and structural factors, the composite measure provides a more analytically rich scalein particular, when examining how changing structural conditions shape individuals' beliefs about success in society. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">2</ref>The second variable to measure meritocratic beliefs is derived from the EVS/WVS item. Our measure is based on a question asking respondents to position themselves on a 10-point scale, with opposing statements at each end. One end has "In the long run, hard work usually brings a better life" (1), and the other end states "Hard work doesn't generally bring success -it's more a matter of luck and connections" (10). We reversed the scale so that higher values indicate a stronger belief in meritocracy. While the ISSP-and EVS/WVS-based rating scales differ from each other, we do not aim to harmonize both measures, but will instead rely on a newly developed modelling technique to account for these differences in rating scale formats (for further elaborations, see below).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Analytical strategy</head><p>Leveraging the time series cross-sectional structure of our data, we implement a three-step strategy to infer the association between economic inequality and citizens' belief in meritocracy. First, we apply the random-effects within-between multilevel (REWB) estimator <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Fairbrother, 2014)</ref> separately to the ISSP and EVS/WVS samples. This approach allows us to differentiate the effects of betweencountry differences in inequality levels on meritocratic beliefs from the impact of within-country inequality dynamics over time. By isolating these within-country changes from between-country differences in inequality, by primarily basing our inferences on the former, and by additionally incorporating period fixed effects (FEs) to account for any secular changes in meritocracy beliefs that may have occurred in all countries, we aim to minimize the risk of omitted variable bias, which otherwise complicates causal inference in cross-sectional analyses <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Gangl, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Morgan and Winship, 2014)</ref>. Taking the concern about omitted variable bias one step further, we then estimate hybrid multilevel regression models with country fixed effects and fixed slopes (cFES) <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Giesselmann and Schmidt-Catran, 2019</ref>), whereby we eliminate all time-invariant country-specific characteristics that might confound the relationship between inequality and beliefs in meritocracy, and whereby we ultimately rely on the longitudinal component of our data only.</p><p>After having estimated the REWB and cFES multilevel models separately for both original data sources, we apply a recently developed modelling technique that allows to pool our data across the ISSP and EVS/WVS sources despite differences in the response format of our dependent variable.</p><p>The so-called multiscale ordered logit model <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Gangl, 2025)</ref> extends the standard ordered logit model by including multiple sets of scale location points and by thus allowing to estimate response format-specific cut-off points and a common substantive regression model for the pooled survey data. As such, the multiscale ordered logit (mscologit) model is particularly suitable for studying the impact of inequality on meritocratic beliefs in the present context, as pooling the survey data allows us to significantly extend our analytical leverage by maximizing the geographical and historical scope of our database. In the course of pooling ISSP and EVS/WVS data together, we adjusted the hierarchical multilevel structure so that country-years that are represented in both surveys will be treated as independent samples from the same historical context. This approach was adopted in order to account for country-survey-year peculiarities, e.g. related to survey question or sampling specificities.</p><p>Finally, as third step of our approach, we take full advantage of the statistical flexibility of the mscologit model. As a generalised ordered logit model, the mscologit model permits to relax the parallel regression assumption and thus to assess whether model parameters are constant over the entire outcome distribution or whether individuals from one part of the outcome distribution are differently affected by a covariate than individuals from other parts of the distribution. A conceptually different but formally equivalent perspective is that evidence of effect heterogeneity provides an indication that some particular covariate is generating not just an upward or downward shift in the outcome variable, but is altering the spread and overall shape of the distribution of meritocracy beliefs among citizens. In our heterogeneity analysis, we will specifically examine variation in regression parameters between the lowest quartile, the second quartile and the upper half of the distribution of meritocracy beliefs. The separation of the outcome distribution into three distinctive parts corresponds to the maximum level of heterogeneity that is currently allowed for in the mscologit Stata ado that we utilised to estimate the model, and we used a range of explorative analyses to determine the concrete cutoff points that best reflect the empirical patterns of effect heterogeneity among the two macro covariates of inequality and prosperity under this constraint.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Does economic inequality erode meritocratic beliefs?</head><p>We present the main results from our multilevel models in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1 (</ref>and<ref type="table" target="#tab_7">see   Tables A2</ref> and<ref type="table" target="#tab_8">A3</ref> for full results). Models M1 (ISSP data) and M4 (EVS/WVS data)</p><p>show the baseline estimates for the effect of inequality, depending on the data source used. The first notable finding is the lack of support for the well-known "paradox of inequality". Unlike Mijs (2021), we do not observe a positive betweeneffect of inequality in either the ISSP or the EVS/WVS data, which is striking given that Mijs himself identified this effect using ISSP data from 1989 to 2009. Instead of a between-effect, however, we find a negative within-effect of inequality over time.</p><p>According to our estimates, each one-point increase in the Gini coefficient is associated with a decrease in respondents' belief in meritocracy by a modest -0.344 points (p&lt;0.1) on the 100-point scale of the ISSP data, and by -0.055 points (p&lt;0.05) on the 10-point scale of the EVS/WVS.</p><p>In Models M2 and M5, we then control for economic prosperity to account for potential confounding effects on the relationship between inequality and meritocratic beliefs. These models also account for compositional differences by including individual-level socio-economic and socio-demographic controls. The estimates for the between-country differences in inequality and the within-country differences of inequality over time are hardly affected, all else being equal, not the least because GDP per capita is hardly showing any robust association with respondents' meritocratic beliefs in our data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>[INSERT TABLE 2 HERE]</head><p>In the final model specification (Models M3 and M6), we eliminate all observed or unobserved time-invariant country differences by introducing country fixed effects.</p><p>To obtain a genuine within estimator of inequality, these models furthermore account for country-specific effects heterogeneity of socio-economic factors (i.e. social class and education), also known as country fixed effects and slopes (cFES) model <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Giesselmann and Schmidt-Catran, 2019)</ref>. Nevertheless, our within estimates remain robustand, if anything, become even stronger -after applying the most rigorous model specification with the available data. Rising inequality decreases individuals' belief in meritocracy by -0.443 points (p&lt;0.001) on 100-point scale using the ISSP and by -0.053 points (p&lt;0.05) on a 10-point scale using the EVS/WVS data, respectively. While these effects are certainly rather moderate in magnitude, one should take into account that we are describing a sociotropic effect of changing income distribution on the average individuals' belief in meritocracy and holding constant individual socioeconomic status. When predicting the change in meritocratic beliefs across the range of changes in the Gini coefficient as seen in many countries over the past three and a half decades (where a change of +5 points corresponds to experiences of Sweden and the US, for example), Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> illustrates that the implications are substantively relevant after all.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Beyond the mean: Heterogeneous responses to rising inequality</head><p>This main result is also confirmed when we pool the ISSP and EVS/WVS data and use the mscologit model to estimate a common regression model to predict respondents' meritocratic beliefs, even when the raw data has been collected in different rating question formats. Like in the separate models of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>, the estimates from the multiscale ordered logit model confirm that rising economic inequality is exerting a moderately negative effect on meritocracy beliefs (see Model M1 in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref>), except that we are now able to leverage the full potential of our survey data from 39 countries, 183 country-survey-rounds, and more than 175,000 respondents. As with any logit model, the parameter estimate of β=-0.035 (p&lt;0.05) expresses the logarithmic odds of respondents crossing any of the rating scale thresholds when characterising their belief in meritocracy and thus indicates that respondents become increasingly less likely to provide positive answers when inequality is rising within any country in the sample. We will also visualize the implied magnitude of the effect estimate when discussing the evidence from an mscologit model with heterogeneous effects in the next step, but it is worth mentioning that the parameter estimates that we report here and below all result from cFES model specifications, i.e. all continue the setup of models M3 and M6 in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> and thus account for country-and period FEs as well as country-specific effects of respondents' SES on meritocratic beliefs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>[INSERT TABLE 3 HERE]</head><p>In addition to a standard regression model that is representing the association between covariates and outcome variables in form of a mean shift in the location of the outcome distribution, we can utilize the mscologit model to address whether the effect of inequality is affecting the shape of the outcome distribution and whether citizens in different parts of the distribution of meritocracy beliefs are responding in different ways to rising inequality. Model M2 of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> provides the corresponding estimates from a cFES mscologit model that allows for separate effect parameters in the lower quartile, the second quartile, and in the upper half of the outcome distribution, respectively. Empirically, we observe that the negative effect of inequality on meritocracy beliefs in meritocracy is most pronounced in the lower half of the distribution, i.e. among citizens who are already predisposed to view social success as determined by structural inequalities or luck. Notably, the effect of inequality is clearly negative in the lower half of the distribution (with β=-0.055, p&lt;0.001 in the lowest quartile, β=-0.043, p&lt;0.01 in the second quartile, and the difference in parameter estimates not being statistically significant between the first two quartiles), but not statistically significantly different from zero in the upper half of the outcome distribution (with β=-0.016, p&gt;0.1, and the parameter difference of ∆β=-0.028 between the second quartile and the upper half being statistically significant at p&lt;0.01). As a result, rising inequality is contributing to a polarisation of meritocratic beliefs because inequality is specifically increasing the proportion of structuralist attitudes in the citizenry. From a theoretical point of view, this type of dispersion effect effectively corresponds to the expectations of sociological conflict perspectives that rising inequality is primarily affecting the lower half of the belief distribution, and is inciting (more) doubts about meritocratic realities. In contrast, this evidence challenges theoretical expectations of both segregation theory and relative power theory which predict either patterns of polarization driven form the top or patterns of convergence driven from the bottom.</p><p>Interestingly, although it is beyond the scope of our present paper to provide any deeper discussion on this observation, model M2 indicates that standard regression specifications are masking important heterogeneity with respect to the effect of economic prosperity as well. Specifically, the null effects that we obtained in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> and model M1 of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> are concealing an important divergence in how rising prosperity is affecting meritocracy beliefs, insofar as evidently positive effects of rising prosperity in the lowest quartile of meritocracy beliefs (at β=0.260, p&lt;0.05) are being offset by, tentatively, a negative effect in the upper half of the distribution (at β=-0.198, but p&gt;0.1). These results offer some indication of a 'tunnel effect' <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Hirschman and Rothschild, 1973)</ref> that might be at work, whereby rising prosperity fosters optimism about meritocracy, even amid increasing inequality.</p><p>To provide a graphical illustration of the effect of inequality, Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> contrasts two predicted outcome distributions, each based on the heterogeneous effects model M2 and each done separately for the ISSP and EVS/WVS response scales:</p><p>(1) a baseline distribution where all coefficients are set to zero (i.e. the centered mean) and (2) a counterfactual distribution that results from simulating the effect of a five-point increase in the Gini coefficient. Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> clearly visualizes that rising inequality leads to a polarisation of meritocratic beliefs from below. This dispersion effect is most clearly visible in the ISSP scale, which exhibits greater variance than the EVS/WVS one and which thus provided a somewhat more nuanced depiction of how rising inequality alters the shape of the distributionparticularly through a widening spread of the distribution in its lower half.<ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">3</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>[INSERT FIGURE 2 HERE]</head><p>As a final step of the analysis, we assess whether the polarisation of meritocratic beliefs that is evident in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> is being channelled via a socioeconomic polarisation of meritocratic beliefs. To this end, we run a final mscologit model that is incorporating effect heterogeneity and cross-level interactions between respondents' socio-economic positions, namely their social class and level of education, and our two macro covariates of inequality and economic prosperity.</p><p>According to Model M3 of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref>, we do find robust, albeit moderately-sized, evidence in favour of a cross-level interaction between inequality and respondents' social class, but we do not observe a similar pattern for respondents' education.</p><p>Accounting for these cross-level interactions is mediating the heterogeneous effect of inequality (i.e. lowering coefficient estimates) to some small extent, yet it seems evident that the channel via individuals' socioeconomically stratified responses to rising inequality is not the primary driver for the observed polarization of meritocratic beliefs.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusions</head><p>By leveraging three decades of comparative survey data from 39 advanced capitalist economies, we investigated how changes in income inequality influence citizens' beliefs about the role of merit in achievement and success in society. more ambiguity in beliefs as individuals can hold beliefs in both meritocratic and non-meritocratic forces of inequality at the same time. In the EVS/WVS, however, individuals are confronted with a trade-off between the significance of non-meritocratic and meritocratic elements, thereby compelling them to position themselves or at least to lean towards one direction. As we read our results, it appears that inequality is particularly unfolding a heterogeneous impact once individuals are facing such a trade-off as they seem more inclined to reassess and adjust their beliefs. We are grateful to one of the anonymous SER reviewers for suggesting this supplementary analysis.</p><p>Challenging the seminal finding of an apparent "paradox of inequality" from Mijs (2021), we do not find an effect of inequality at the between-country level in our data at all. Instead, our empirical analysis reveals robust evidence of a substantively moderate, but clearly negative effect from the within-country component of variation in economic inequality. That is, as inequality is rising within a country over time, citizens tend to lose faith in meritocracy to a certain degree, in fact independently of their personal socio-economic standing. As our multilevel regression models account for respondents' socio-demographic characteristics when estimating the association between macro level inequality and citizens' beliefs in meritocracy, our analyses confirm a sociotropic effect of changes in inequality on changing beliefs in meritocracy that cannot be reduced to an effect of individual socio-economic positions. In addition, we observe that this negative effect of changes in inequality is not uniform across the distribution of citizens' beliefs in meritocracy, but is occurring mainly in its lower part. Rising inequality in other words is contributing to an increasing polarisation in citizens' perceptions of meritocratic realities, because the proportion of citizens who hold deeply sceptical perceptions of meritocracy is growing at the same time while the share of citizens who are holding fundamentally positive views about the state of meritocracy in their society is essentially unaffected by changes in inequality.</p><p>With these empirical observations, our study ends up striking the middle ground between sharply opposing perspectives that have characterised the study of material inequality and meritocratic beliefs in recent years. As we fail to find evidence for a positive effect of inequality on citizens' belief in meritocracy, we cannot confirm any counterintuitive association that then would require new theoretical propositions to explain any apparent paradox in the next step. Without evidence for a positive association between inequality and belief in meritocracy, however, our analysis fails to support the segregation mechanism introduced by Mijs (2021) as well as the power resources model advanced by <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Solt et al. (2016)</ref>, which have both been put forward to account for "paradoxical" effects of inequality observed in their research.</p><p>Instead, our evidence that rising inequality is depressing citizens' belief in meritocracy principally aligns with sociology's traditional conflict theory perspective as well as with public discourse around contributions like those of <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Wilkinson and Pickett (2009)</ref> or <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Savage (2021)</ref> that identify rising economic inequality as a main cause of social ills. Relative to such generalist perspectives, however, our analysis sides with empirical studies like those of <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">McCall et al. (2017)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Kang and Park (2024)</ref> that find negative, but substantively moderate effects of inequality on citizens' belief in meritocracy. Rising inequality thus weakens belief in meritocracy, but equally clearly, even the significant increases in inequality as observed in many affluent economies over the past three decades have not fundamentally undermined citizens' convictions that individual skills and effort get rewarded in their societies.</p><p>One factor in this surely is that in response to rising inequality, we observe a polarisation of citizens' beliefs that is driven from below. Especially in the EVS/WVS surveys, where the question format forces respondents to place themselves on a unidimensional scale, we find that citizens' beliefs in the upper half of the distribution remain largely unaltered from changes in inequality, whereas rising inequality is having a more pronounced impact in the bottom part of the belief distribution. Rising inequality in other words tends to deepen meritocratic scepticism among those citizens who are already holding more structuralist beliefs than the average citizen.</p><p>This pattern principally accords with the predictions from a conflict perspective, but on a more critical note, we also need to acknowledge that the polarisation of meritocratic beliefs that we observe in the data does not appear to align particularly well with a conflict perspective insofar as attitudinal polarisation does not primarily seem to follow socio-economic fault lines. As one among several SES dimensions tested, respondents' social class position alone to some limited extent taps into the polarisation of meritocratic beliefs, but other measures entirely fail to yield evidence for a cross-level interaction effect with inequality. Judged from these empirical patterns, it seems doubtful that, as would be predicted from a conflict perspective, socioeconomic polarisation between privileged and disadvantaged members of society really is the major axis of attitudinal polarisation in the wake of rising inequality, at least as far as citizens' belief in meritocracy is being concerned.</p><p>As a matter of fact, understanding the precise nature of polarisation in meritocratic beliefs is certainly not the only aspect of the relationship between inequality and perceptions of meritocracy where further research seems required to disentangle alternative theoretical explanations, if not plain empirical facts. As one example, more detailed data are necessary to better capture relevant processes of belief formation, and to decide whether the root cause behind the negative effect of rising inequality on citizens' belief in meritocracy that we observe may be experiential in nature, i.e. may be reflecting the changing quality of citizens' social interactions and inferences in more or less stratified societies (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Mijs, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Mijs and Usmani, 2024)</ref>, or whether rising inequality may be activating citizens' class consciousness as argued by <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Newman et al. (2015)</ref>. Going beyond our specific findings, however, one cannot fail to notice that the whole area of research is characterised by rather wide variation in key findings, even across high-quality studies. To try and reconcile the discrepant results from the literature, one promising approach could be to explore systematic effect heterogeneity across time and place. If rising inequality may trigger not just one, but potentially several plausible and complementary processes of belief formationlike those described under the three theoretical perspectives we have been contrasting in the present papervariation in findings may result from variation in what may have been the dominant psychological or structural response to high levels of inequality under different institutional or historical settings. Our own study has reported empirical estimates of what clearly amounts to the average effect of inequality on meritocratic beliefs across a fairly broad sample of countries and across a fairly extensive observation window of more than three decades of historical data, and further insight might be generated by exploring more systematically whether and under what conditionse.g. in singlecountry studies based on U.S. data versus more comprehensive cross-country studiesone may observe sign reversals or changes in the magnitude of inequality effects relative to the results that we report. A second consideration to account for the variability of findings in the literature might be that different studies may (implicitly perhaps) be defining different target estimands (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Lundberg et al., 2021)</ref>, and that it is the variation in inferential targets rather than any technical or sample issues that is being reflected in the diversity of findings reported in the current literature. Along this train of thought, one could read some recent evidence (reference omitted during double-blind peer review) to suggest that the discrepancy of findings between the otherwise very similar studies of <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Mijs (2021)</ref> and our present work may be due to overcontrolling bias in <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Mijs (2021)</ref>, which results in <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Mijs (2021)</ref> focusing on the effect of inequality on beliefs while keeping individual mobility experiences constant, whereas we conceive of them as part of treatment. Likewise, the discrepancy between the findings from some U.S. and British research using local inequality measures and studies like ours that has relied on national inequality measures may reflect important substantive differences in the informational content of either type of experiential context, where local inequality may spur meritocratic beliefs because socioeconomically integrated environments are known to provide conditions to foster upward mobility, presumably via exposing lower-background individuals to local examples of socioeconomic success (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Chetty et al., 2022)</ref>, whereas nationallevel inequality may be more likely to capture a broader set of processes from the effects of factual residential segregation to the impact of socioeconomic reference standards conveyed through local observation as well as through exposure to national media sources that all may affect how citizens construe and perceive meritocratic realities.</p><p>All that being said, we also believe that a quite general caveat on our work is in order. Throughout this paper, we have deliberately and quite consciously utilized a terminology of effects of inequality on citizens' meritocracy beliefs. We have done so both because we are convinced that the terminologies that we employ as researchers need to conceptually correspond to the inferential goals that we pursue, and because we are convinced that our empirical approach is capable to at least suggest a causal reading of our evidence and to provide useful empirical estimates to approximate the likely magnitude and direction of the effect in question. Defending this reading of our study in principle should not be equated with the claim that all the well-known threats in inferring causality from non-experimental research designs could have been countered in our work. Among these, two concerns are likely to stand out: First, despite aiming to isolate the causal effect of inequality on citizens' meritocratic beliefs, our study had to rely on repeated cross-sectional data provided by the ISSP and WVS/EVS surveys. Our analysis does speak to attitudinal changes being associated with changes in inequality, but as we are unable to directly observe attitudinal changes at the individual level, we cannot with full certainty discriminate between actual changes in individual perceptions or group-level changese.g. generational replacementas the source of the empirical association we observe.</p><p>Likewise, while we think that a causal reading of our evidence is principally defensible, we readily acknowledge that inequality is a causally more opaque factor than the specific intervention at the heart of any randomized experiment. As a contextual condition at the macro level of whole societies, inequality clearly does not correspond to any singular and well-defined treatment, but is in fact the aggregate result of a multitude of processes in the labour market, within families, and in the political domain. Our own research as well as other studies in the area could definitely benefit from efforts to identify which particular sources of inequalityi.e. changes in labour markets, changes in the structure of families, or changes in public policies -may be responsible for changes in citizens' perceptions of meritocratic realities, and from additional attempts to ascertain the robustness of our findings against variations in our research design and modelling decisions. Once again, further research seems required.</p></div>

The results document that inequality affects both dimensions in the exact same direction; the effect is merely about twice as large in magnitude for believing in structural inequality, implying that rising inequality erodes meritocratic beliefs by diminishing the perceived role of individual achievements and effort and, even more importantly, by increasing the perceived importance of structural forces for success.</p></note>

This additional analysis indicates that our findings on attitudinal polarization are primarily driven by patterns in the EVS/WVS sample, whereas the effects of both economic inequality and GDP/capita appear largely homogeneous across the full outcome distribution in the ISSP data. In our view, these results suggest that effect heterogeneity is sensitive to the survey measurement. More specifically, the measurement in the ISSP data allows for</p></note>
