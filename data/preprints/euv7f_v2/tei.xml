<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In social science and epidemiological research, individual risk factors for mortality are often examined in isolation, while approaches that consider multiple risk factors simultaneously remain less common. Using the Health and Retirement Study in the US, the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe, and the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing in the UK, we explore the predictability of death with machine learning and explainable AI algorithms, which integrate explanation and prediction simultaneously. Specifically, we extract information from all datasets in seven health-related domains, including demographic, socioeconomic, psychology, social connections, childhood adversity, adulthood adversity, and health behaviours. Our self-devised algorithm reveals consistent domain-level patterns across datasets, with demography and socioeconomic factors being the most significant. However, at the individual risk-factor level, notable di!erences emerge, emphasising the context-specific nature of certain predictors.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>The contention that death is not merely biologically determined has increasingly been embraced by recent research <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. Specifically, social epidemiology emphasises the distribution of social determinants of health <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>. Manifold literature substantiates the significance of social determinants of health. Theoretically, studies such as Link and Phelan <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref> present the Fundamental Cause Theory, positing that health is associated with multiple social factors including wealth and education. Socioeconomic status, for example, influences health through various mechanisms such as access to nutritious food, adopting healthy lifestyles, and the availability of medical resources. This relationship is complicated and pervasive <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref>.</p><p>Lorant et al. <ref type="bibr">[5]</ref> conducted a meta-analysis to assess the magnitude, shape and modifiers of the association between socioeconomic status and depression, finding compelling evidence for socioeconomic inequality in depression. Sta!ord and Marmot <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> examined the impact of neighbourhood socioeconomic status on individual health outcomes, revealing that poorer individuals who live in deprived neighbourhoods experience the most significant negative health e!ects. Additional evidence has been accrued regarding other social factors such as social relationships <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, mental health <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, and childhood adversity <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</p><p>Nevertheless, social determinants of health are inherently multidisciplinary, necessitating a holistic study design. For example, the biopsychosocial model proposed by Engel <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> underscores the interplay among social, biological, and psychological factors, where all of these factors dynamically interact with each other and continuously a!ect health outcomes. Moreover, intersectionality theory specifically highlights that disadvantages a!ecting life outcomes (including health) accumulate from multiple sources that are not independent of each other <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Although the theory mainly focuses on interactions of individual identities, its emphasis on a holistic research framework facilitates understanding of the complicated, multidimensional nature of health inequalities.</p><p>While substantial evidence demonstrates the statistically significant association between theoretically proven risk factors and mortality, only a few studies have ventured beyond this explanatory framework to adopt an integrated approach alongside advanced methods. Puterman et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> compared the contribution of 57 economic, behavioural, social, and psychological factors in predicting death within the US context using multivariate Cox regressions, LASSO, and random forests. Similarly, Breen and Seltzer <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> applied machine learning algorithms to predict life expectancy based on early adulthood socioeconomic and demographic information using US administrative data. In a di!erent context, Vabalas et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> employed Finnish registry data to develop a deep-learning algorithm for modelling one-year mortality, incorporating over 8,000 features from the domains of medical care, socioeconomic status, and demography.</p><p>While these studies achieved varying levels of predictive performance, they are all limited to modelling within a single country's perspective.</p><p>Given that health outcomes reflect the e!ects of health policy, medical conditions and cultural di!erences <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, comparing the impact of established risk factors across di!erent countries can provide valuable insights for improving health inequalities regionally. For example, Raghupathi and Raghupathi <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> explored the association between adult education level-specifically upper secondary education-and cancer mortality in OECD countries by continent. While the association indicates that a higher proportion of upper secondary education correlates with fewer cancer deaths across all continents, the strength of this association varies, with North America exhibiting the strongest correlation.</p><p>Consequently, we propose a holistic approach to examine death, as one of the most definitive factors linked with health and its most notable downstream consequences. Here, 'holistic' refers to a comprehensive, multidisciplinary research framework that incorporates a wealth of health-related information. However, holism should not be misconstrued as focusing solely on the quantity of risk factors. Instead, it ought to be conceived in terms of the relevance and utility of information to the research topic <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. Therefore, in our research, we elect to re-examine the risk factors from the work of Puterman et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, which encompasses information from seven di!erent domains: demography, socioeconomics, psychology, social connections, childhood adversity, adulthood adversity, and health behaviours. This approach not only enhances the credibility of the results and potentially improves prediction accuracy, but also o!ers the opportunity to compare the relative contributions of factors from di!erent domains. To foster cross-country comparisons, we employ data from three di!erent data sources: the US Health and Retirement Study (HRS), the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA), and the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE). All of these are sampled from developed countries and are part of the Gateway to Global Ageing Data, which ensures a similar data structure, facilitating meaningful comparisons.</p><p>Methodologically, we adopt a predictive framework as most theories are developed based on internal processes, leaving their external predictive validity rarely tested. Additionally, considering the need to bridge explanation and prediction, we propose an innovative research paradigm to estimate the risk factors of death. This involves training a high-accuracy predictive model using advanced machine learning algorithms and deconstructing the results with explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods, such as Shapley Values <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, to present an explainable framework. This approach remains comparatively unexplored, and it helps to unpack predictability and expose inequalities and biases residing in social systems by revealing the impact and direction of predictors, allowing further investigation, scientific discovery, and improved policy-making.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data</head><p>The comprehensive design of the HRS, SHARE, and ELSA fosters a holistic investigation into risk factors influencing death probabilities. We have selected the HRS as the primary dataset for calibration. All risk factors are harmonised and comparable across di!erent datasets (See Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S1</ref> for details of the sampling procedure and data sources for all datasets and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S2</ref> for data description and risk factor availability). The study focuses on individuals aged over 50, with summary information for the three main datasets presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">S1</ref> for combined datasets). See Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">S2</ref> and S3 for the coverage of risk factors by dataset and domain.</p><p>In this study, we define the outcome variable death as a binary indicator, where 1 denotes death and 0 indicates survival until the end of the prediction window. We aim to predict the probability of death within a specified future time frame. Each dataset employs distinct sampling and prediction windows, as illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>. The 'Survey' windows correspond to the periods during which data collection was conducted, while the 'Death' windows represent the time frames over which mortality outcomes were recorded. For instance, in the HRS dataset, we utilise information collected between 1998 and 2008 to predict deaths occurring from 2008 to 2019. This framework reframes our research question as follows: Given an individual's previously collected data, what is the probability of death within the next X years (where X varies by dataset)?</p><p>We define death prevalence as the ratio death counts within observation window total observations within the sampling window . For all individuals included in the analysis, either the exact death or a confirmed alive status is available.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> presents the age distributions by death status across the three datasets (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">S3</ref> provides age and gender decomposed death prevalence). Among them, ELSA exhibits the lowest death prevalence, which can be attributed to its relatively shorter prediction window.   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical Analysis</head><p>We estimate the predictability of elderly mortality using each of the three datasets in- Since SHAP values can be both positive and negative, we primarily present the mean absolute SHAP for interpretation. Given the sensitivity involved in predicting subjective mortality, individual-level SHAP values will not be presented.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">dividually</formula><p>In addition to analysing single risk factors, we devise a new leave-one-domain-out algorithm to estimate the domain-level importance in prediction accuracy. This algorithm iterates through all possible domain combinations (127 combinations with seven domains) and calculates the marginal contribution of each specific domain to the evaluation metric. The final domain importance is the mean of all marginal contributions across every possible combination. This approach provides a comprehensive comparison of risk factors at an aggregate level.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Death Predictability   We find that death is generally highly predictable across all models and datasets, as the PR-AUC scores are more than double the in-sample prevalence, which represents the probability of random guessing and serves as the interpretation baseline of PR-AUC. Predictions made using HRS and combined datasets demonstrate better performance, as both dataset sizes and in-sample prevalence are significantly larger compared to SHARE and ELSA. Surprisingly, the ensemble learner SL performs worse than LightGBM in all scenarios, signalling that LightGBM achieves overwhelmingly strong predictive performance and thus is not suitable for averaging with other algorithms in this case. A consistent pattern emerges in all datasets, highlighting the demographic and socioeconomic domains as the most influential in enhancing the PR-AUC score, thereby improving the precision and accuracy of predictions. This finding aligns with the Fundamental Cause Theory proposed by Link and Phelan <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref>, which posits that socioeconomic status exerts a persistent influence on health through multiple mechanisms, playing a fundamental role in health disparities. The demographic domain, encompassing key variables such as age and gender, consistently exhibits a substantial contribution across all datasets. This demographicsocioeconomic pattern also exists in the combined datasets, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">S4</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cross Sectional Similarities: Domain Contribution</head><p>It is important to acknowledge that the model's predictive performance is inherently shaped by the amount of relevant information presented in the data. For instance, in the HRS dataset, the psychological domain includes the largest number of risk factors, which partially explains its substantial contribution to domain-level predictive performance. However, the number of predictors alone does not fully determine domain importance. For example, in SHARE, the demographic and psychological domains contain three and six factors, respectively, yet the demographic domain's contribution is more than twenty times greater than that of the psychological domain.</p><p>In ELSA, the absence of the childhood-adversity domain may result in an incomplete assessment of risk factor importance, particularly in capturing the marginal impact associated with the psychological and social connection domain. As demonstrated by Kessler et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, childhood adversities have a significant impact on adult mental disorders across 21 countries.</p><p>Additionally, the distinct pattern of domain importance observed in ELSA may, in part, be attributed to the short prediction window, which restricts the dataset's capacity to capture variable importance beyond the demographic domain.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cross Sectional Dissimilarities: Risk Factor Importance</head><p>Beyond assessing risk factor importance from a model performance perspective, we calculate SHAP values for a representative model from each dataset to decompose predicted death probabilities. Our objective is to provide insights into variable importance within robust predictive frameworks, aligning with the interpretative nature of SHAP values. Notably, SHAP values can accurately reflect factor importance only when the predictive algorithm is reliable.</p><p>To mitigate the risk of over-interpreting unstable results, we present only those risk factors with stable SHAP values (i.e. their mean |SHAP| → 0.1) that rank among the top tier in risk comparisons.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref> highlights the key di!erences among the datasets, which primarily stem from three aspects: the specific risk factors identified, their relative rankings, and their levels of In ELSA, income ranks as the forth most significant predictor, whereas its impact-along with wealth-is less pronounced in SHARE and HRS. Furthermore, even among common risk factors, their relative importance varies. For example, income is a stronger predictor in ELSA than in HRS, which may be attributed to ELSA's exclusive reliance on income rather than both income and wealth. Similarly, low/no vigorous activity plays a more significant role in ELSA compared to HRS, despite their similar mean values of approximately 0.7. In terms of smoking status, SHARE stands out by identifying only current smoking as a significant risk factor, whereas history of smoking is more relevant in the other datasets. This distinction is likely due to the substantially higher prevalence of current smokers in SHARE (mean value: 0.48) compared to HRS (0.12) and ELSA (0.18).</p><p>Given our focus on predicting mortality outcomes in the elderly population, we further stratify the mean absolute SHAP values (|SHAP|) by age groups within each dataset, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5</ref>. This stratification helps identify age-related gradients in feature importance and enables more nuanced cross-sectional comparisons across datasets.</p><p>Among the common predictors, age exhibits a consistent 'U-' or 'V-' shaped pattern in all three datasets. Notably, the lowest |SHAP| values occur within the 60-75 age range, which corresponds approximately to the mean age at death in each dataset. This indicates that age contributes less to mortality prediction near the average death age, and becomes  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>In this study, we first address the question of how well mortality can be predicted using social determinants by selecting the best-performing model among multiple machine learning algorithms. Utilising information from multiple domains, we achieve high predictive performance across all datasets: in HRS, SHARE, and ELSA, the highest ROC-AUC scores are 0.820, 0.815, and 0.832, respectively, while PR-AUC scores reach 0.698, 0.586, and 0.533, respectively. Notably, the predictive performance of ELSA improves significantly when integrated with other datasets, particularly in combination with HRS (PR-AUC = 0.650).</p><p>At the domain level, we develop a leave-one-out algorithm to assess the marginal contribution of each domain, averaging its predictive performance impact across all possible combinations. Despite variations in the number of risk factors across domains, consistent patterns emerge. In all datasets, demographic and socioeconomic factors are the most influential predictors. In HRS and SHARE, the child-adversity domain ranks third in importance. Health behaviours domain holds this position in ELSA. It also suggests that while key domains influencing mortality are relatively stable across countries, their relative importance may vary.</p><p>These findings align with previous research indicating that while individual domains may have limited predictive power in isolation, their combined e!ects are critical for capturing mortality risk <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</p><p>Dissimilarities are largely discovered in the decomposition of prediction using SHAP values. This decomposition enables us to identify the most influential individual risk factors for mortality prediction within each dataset, reflecting the unique characteristics and contextual influences of di!erent populations. Age and gender consistently emerge as critical predictors across all datasets, underscoring the foundational role of demographic factors in mortality modelling among ageing populations. This finding aligns with existing literature. For example, Aida et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> shows a large-scale change of survival days in both ELSA and the Japan Gerontological Evaluation Study (JAGES) with increasing age. Lantz et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> demonstrates significant survival di!erences between females and males among U.S. adults.</p><p>However, beyond these commonalities, di!erent datasets prioritise di!erent risk factors.</p><p>In HRS, the top-tier risk factors (mean |SHAP| &gt; 0.1) highlight the significance of socioeconomic status, health behaviours, and mental health within the U.S. context. In SHARE, socioeconomic conditions, health behaviours, and childhood adversity emerge as key predictors, aligning with domain-level analyses. ELSA exhibits the broadest set of high-importance risk factors, encompassing multiple domains, which may be attributable to its inferior model performance and incomplete coverage of risk factors at the domain level.</p><p>Notable regional variations exist. For instance, current smoking status is highly influential in SHARE but not in HRS. Conversely, factors such as history of smoking and low/no vigorous activity play a more prominent role in HRS but not in the European datasets. Moreover, while ELSA shares many high-importance risk factors with both HRS and SHARE, it uniquely emphasises lower occupational status and lower education as key predictors. These di!erences highlight the necessity of context-specific approaches to mortality risk assessment, reinforcing the importance of integrating both generalised and localised perspectives in demographic and health research. Despite the strengths of this study, several limitations must be acknowledged. First, discrepancies in data collection methodologies across datasets result in imperfect alignment of risk factors. This mismatch reduces the number of directly comparable variables when integrating datasets, thereby constraining cross-contextual comparisons (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S2</ref>). For instance, only 25 out of 61 risk factors in HRS have direct counterparts in SHARE.</p><p>Second, our analysis is limited to mortality prediction within high-income countries-the U.S., Europe, and the U.K. While prioritising variable consistency enables more robust modelling, the exclusion of datasets from low-and middle-income countries restricts the generalisability of our findings. Incorporating data from comparable large-scale studies, such as the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study and the Longitudinal Aging Study in India, would enable a more comprehensive examination of global health disparities.</p><p>Finally, the exclusion of biological and genetic variables due to data limitations constrains the comprehensiveness of our models. Integrating biomarkers and genetic data could enhance predictive accuracy and provide deeper insights into the complex interplay between biological and social determinants of health. As such data become increasingly available, future studies should seek to incorporate these dimensions to refine mortality prediction models further.</p><p>1 Methodology</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">Super Learner</head><p>Developed by Laan, Polley, and Hubbard <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>, a Super Learner (SL) is an ensemble algorithm that multiple di!erent machine learning models together to produce a prediction that performs better than a single model. Ensemble models have long been discussed and explored; normally scientists choose to ensemble models either by averaging or applying some pre-defined weights, usually generated from the model performance. However, Laan, Polley, and Hubbard <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref> has devised the SL, which aims to use a learning algorithm to cross-validate and find the optimal weights to combine a collection of predictive models.</p><p>To facilitate understanding, we divide the whole process into two parts: the cross-validation stage and the ensemble learning stage. We start illustrating by defining a set of m base predictive algorithms as g 1 , g 2 , g 3 , ..., g m , each representing a single candidate learner applied in the SL. In our case, as we aim to predict a binary outcome, we choose a set of classifiers including a stochastic gradient descent classifier, K-neighbors Classifier, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree classifier, Support Vector Machines, Gaussian Naive Bayesian, Adaptive Boosting Classifier, Bagging Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, Extra Trees Classifier, Light Gradient Boosting Machine Classifier, eXtreme Gradient Boosting Machine Classifier as the basic learners.</p><p>In the cross-validation stage, the ultimate goal is to construct and retrieve the performance of each learner in the training set. Specifically, the training set will be split into v mutual exclusive and nearly equal size sub-sets where candidate learners will be cross-validates on each of the v splits. In other words, further by splitting the original training set into v splits, selecting one of them v i as a sub-validation set and the rest as sub-training sets (v → 1 splits), every learner will be trained on the sub-training set and validated on the sub-validation set, generating a corresponding prediction of v i . Repeating this procedure v times (validation set v i , i = 1, ..., v) to generate a complete list of v predictions. Therefore, after v times of repeating validation on m single learners, we will generate a new space of possible outcomes Z, which has the same number of rows as the training set and m columns.</p><p>Then we move to the ensemble learning stage where the main goal is to train a user-defined learning algorithm " that minimises the squared error loss function. Specifically, " is designed to estimate the regression E(Y |Z), where Y is the real label of the training set. The " can also be defined as the minimum cross-validated risk predictor as it minimises the cross-validated risk generated in the last step. Lastly, the fitted " will be applied to the single learners that are trained on the whole training set. Based on the data P n and value X, the SL is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">" (P n ) (X) ↑ "→ (P n ) "j (P n ) (X), j = 1, . . . , m<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where " is the mapping function ensembles the m learners from their risks obtained from the cross-validate step and "→ (P n ) is the actual obtained predictor from the mapping function. In other words, in a SL, the Y for a value X is obtained by evaluating the predictor "→ (P n ) at the J predicted values at X of the m candidate learners. In our case, we select LightGBM as the ensemble mapping learner.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">LightGBM</head><p>As LightGBM is selected as a benchmark method, we briefly review its mechanism. Developed by et al. <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>, LightGBM is a cutting-edge variant of gradient boosting machine (GBM). In essence, it is a powerful ensemble learning method that aggregates multiple weak classifiers together to form a single learner in the manner of reducing errors along the gradient direction. It can be described with equations as follows: suppose we have T regressions trees f t (X) and the ultimate predicted value is generated through an integrated regression tree of the T regressions, i.e. F t (x i ) = T t=1 f t (X). The integration is conducted through minimising a specific loss function i l (ŷ i , y i ) where the y i is the true value of death occurrence and ŷi is the predicted value. We choose the log loss here as our outcome variable is binary. During integration at the t th step, the LightGBM method aims to minimise the value of following equation:</p><p>min</p><formula xml:id="formula_2"># (t) = min n i=1 l (y i , F t↑1 (x i ) + f t (x i ))<label>(2)</label></formula><p>The minimisation task is undertaken by Newton's method as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3"># t ↓ = n i=1 g i f t (x i ) + 1 2 h i f 2 t (x i )<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where again, g i = ω ŷi L (ŷ i , y i ) is the first-order gradient function of the loss function and</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">h i = ω 2</formula><p>ŷi L (ŷ i , y i ) is the second-order. Compared to other GBMs, Light GBM is novel in two unique techniques to tackle big data: Gradient-based One-Side Sampling (GOSS) and Exclusive Feature Bundling (EFB). With GOSS, it can reduce the sample size possessing small gradients as it is defined in information gains that only larger gradients contribute to higher information gain. EFB is designed to reduce the sparsity of the feature space through bundling features that are exclusive and rarely having non-zero values at the same time. Combining the two techniques together, the LightGBM has become one of the most e$cient and scaleable boosting decision tree methods.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3">Shapley Values</head><p>Shapley Values are designed to unravel the input variable importance within machine learning algorithms. For a single feature i, the classical Shapley Value is obtained through the following formula:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">ε i = S↓N \{i} |S|!(M → |S| → 1)! M ! [f x (S ↔ {i}) → f x (S)] (<label>4</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_6">)</formula><p>where S is a non-zero subset of the whole input features. M and N are the total number and the whole set of input features respectively (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> and Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">S1</ref> for the information for all datasets). f x (S) is the prediction function for feature in set S such as LightGBM. Under such a definition, the Shapley Value is a decomposition method that calculates the weighted di!erence between all possible subsets of the input features with and without the specific input feature i. Following the definition, Lundberg, Erion, and Lee <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref> proposed the following equation to calculate Shapley Values:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">f x (S) = f (h x (z ↔ )) = E[f (x)|x s ]<label>( 5 )</label></formula><p>where h x ↔ ) is a mapping function that maps between the original function and the left-out features (z ↔ , in a binary manner by setting z ↔ i = 1 or 0). E[f (x)|x s ] is the expected function value conditioned on the subset S. The resulting Shapley Value will be called SHAP hereafter. In our research, the SHAP value for a risk factor i stands for the log odds being predicted as dead, which is the marginal contribution of i on the death prediction. A positive SHAP indicates a higher possibility of being predicted as dead and a negative value indicates a higher possibility of being predicted as being alive. As SHAP can be both positive and negative, to interpret SHAP, we adopt the mean absolute SHAP. Note that, unlike conventional regressions where a feature will only have one uniform 'ϑ' presenting its contribution, SHAP is calculated at the individual level and therefore a distribution of i will be obtained. Appreciating the essence of predicting frailty in this research and to avoid interpretability at the single-factor level, the individual-level SHAP values will not be presented.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Evaluation Metrics</head><p>In this work, we will evaluate the out-of-sample predictive performance with two broad categories of evaluation metrics: conventional social science metrics and machine learning evaluation metrics. The Pseudo R 2 is calculated to provide conventional insights into the model goodness of fit, providing the following functions:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">Pseudo R 2 = 1 → (y i → ϖ i ) 2 (y i → ȳtest ) 2<label>(6)</label></formula><p>where y i stands for the real death situation of individual i (0 or 1) and ϖ i is the corresponding predicted death probability. ȳtest and ȳtrain are the death prevalence of the test set and train set.</p><p>We will then use the classic PR-AUC score and the innovative Inter-Model Vigorish (IMV) score as machine learning evaluation metrics. The PR-AUC score is the Area Under the Curve of Precision and Recall, which emphasises the harmonic mean of precision and recall. It takes precision ( TP TP+FP ) as the y-axis value, measuring the number of true positive observations against the total number of observations predicted as positive. In the x-axis, the recall rate ( TP TP+FN ) measures the proportion of true positive in the real positive observations. One of the benefits of PR-AUC is that it focuses on the positive labels (death in our study) and therefore avoids a high score if the sample is unevenly distributed. As most of our samples have a very small portion of death (True) labels, PR-AUC is a better choice than the more prevalent ROC-AUC score, as ROC-AUC can easily gain a higher score if we randomly assign a False label to all samples. Using the PR-AUC grants us a more comprehensive understanding of our models. A higher PR-AUC is preferred as a better performance of the prediction, whereas in-sample prevalence (IP, True label portion of the training set) is viewed as a benchmark to interpret the PR-AUC score, any value higher than the IP is a sign of a 'good score'.</p><p>The IMV is a portable metric designed by Domingue et al. <ref type="bibr">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr">5]</ref> to understand the goodness of fit in the case of a binary outcome. We use the score as it's a comparable score between models and datasets, where our analysis involves evaluating the performance of four di!erent datasets. To compute the IMV score, we start by establishing two binary predictive systems, one of which is the baseline and the other one is the enhanced system. The enhanced system 'additional' information that is blind to the baseline system. Recall that the entropy is defined as →1(w log w + (1 → w) log(1 → w)), to compute IMV, we aim to calculate the probability ϱ 0 and ϱ 1 that identifies the entropy of the baseline and enhanced system respectively that fulfils the following function:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">ϱ log(ϱ) + (1 → ϱ) log(1 → ϱ) = log(A) (<label>7</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_10">)</formula><p>where A is the geometric mean of the likelihood of the selected system, defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">A = n i=1 L i 1 n = n i=1 p y i i (1 → p i ) 1↑y i 1 n<label>(8)</label></formula><p>here p i is the predicted death probability of individual i and y i is the true death label of the corresponding individual. The ϱ 0 and ϱ 1 are calculated by minimising the di!erence between the entropy definition and log(A):</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">min ↗ log(ϱ)| + (1 → ϱ) ↗ log(1 → ϱ) → log(A)<label>( 9 )</label></formula><p>and the IMV score is simply the relative ratio of the two probabilities:</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">IMV = w 1 → w 0 w 0<label>(10)</label></formula><p>It reflects the extent the enhanced system (usually the fitted models) outperforms the benchmark system (usually a simple model). We select the in-sample prevalence as w 0 , corresponding to the PR-AUC score described above.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">SHAP Explanation of Age</head><p>To further interpret the 'V-' or 'U-' pattern of age, we note that age is the only feature whose mean SHAP values (not just absolute values) cross the zero line. As shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">S5</ref>, the original SHAP values for age exhibit a steadily increasing trend: younger participants have negative SHAP values, while older participants have positive ones. Since SHAP values represent the marginal contribution of a feature to the model output relative to the mean prediction, a negative SHAP value for age implies a lower predicted probability of death compared to the dataset average, and vice versa. Therefore, the observed 'U-' or 'V-' shaped pattern in |SHAP| values can be understood as reflecting the non-linear influence of age. Age becomes more important for individuals who deviate substantially from the mean age at death-either because they are significantly younger (indicating low risk) or significantly older (indicating high risk).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Model Performance of Combined Datasets</head><p>From the comparison of data performance, we can observe that combining a single dataset with another dataset that has better predictive performance improve the overall predictive capability. For example, any combination of ELSA with HRS and SHARE significantly enhances its performance. Specifically, the PR-AUC increases from 0.533 for ELSA alone to 0.650 for HRS+ELSA and 0.624 for HRS+SHARE+ELSA. For ELSA, primary contributors to this performance improvement are the in-sample prevalence (increasing from 0.169 to 0.259 and 0.239) and the sample size (increasing from 8,389 to 21,599 and 39,417). These two e!ects even outweigh the reduction in the number of risk factors in SHARE+ELSA, where the model still shows improvement despite a reduction of 13 risk factors. Using the combined dataset, we estimate the importance of exploring how variations in the scale of sample size and the number of risk factors a!ect model performance. A similar conclusion could be drawn from SHARE where combining a dataset with better performance could achieve higher scores: both SHARE+HRS and SHARE+HRS+ELSA have higher performance compared to the model trained on SHARE alone, where HRS+SHARE is better than the HRS+SHARE+ELSA model.</p><p>Conversely, combining a dataset with worse predictive performance slightly deteriorates the combined scores. For instance, the PR-AUC score of SHARE+ELSA is lower than that of SHARE alone. In this case, both the number of risk factors (decreasing from 25 to 13) and the in-sample prevalence (declining from 0.214 to 0.200) decrease, while only the sample size increases (from 17,818 to 26,207). Another example is the HRS dataset, which exhibits a slight overall negative impact due to the reduction in risk factors and in-sample prevalence, despite an increase in sample size.     There is a clear and continuous upward trend of mean SHAP values for age across the three datasets, from younger to older age groups. There is a distinct pattern in mean SHAP values across the three datasets, transitioning from negative to positive as age increases. Negative mean SHAP values indicate that younger ages reduce the predicted risk of death relative to the average age of the sample, while positive values show that older ages increase predicted risk. The magnitude of SHAP values on either side of zero reflects how strongly age influences predictions, with larger absolute values indicating stronger relative influence, whether protective (negative SHAP) or risk-enhancing (positive SHAP).</p></div>

This decline may be attributed to the overriding influence of age in latelife mortality risk or to physical limitations among the oldest-old, which may render certain health behaviours, such as vigorous physical activity, less relevant in distinguishing mortality risk within this group.</figDesc></figure>
