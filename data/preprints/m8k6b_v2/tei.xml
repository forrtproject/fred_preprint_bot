<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This paper uses original panel data from Senegal to evaluate the effect of elderly household members' deaths on the educational attainment of female children. Using a tripledifference strategy with child fixed-effects, I show that the death of a co-resident aged 60 or older is associated with 20% additional education completed over a period of 4 years by affected girls. I present evidence that changes in demand for informal caregiving among adolescent girls within the household are one of the mechanisms at play. These results highlight the central role of female teenagers in caregiving activities and suggest that policies that increase the availability of formal care for the elderly could reduce gender inequalities in education in contexts similar to Senegal.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>More and more Africans live long enough to experience the burden of chronic illness and physical impairment. The available projections suggest that the African population above working age will exceed 150 million by 2050, a three-fold increase compared to its 2020 level <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Duhon et al. 2023)</ref>. Few African countries are equipped with the health care and social protection system required to care for a large dependent population. In Senegal, the focus of this paper, there were only two retirement homes for a total population of 12 million in 2010 <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Hane 2011</ref>). As a result, most elderly people rely on their family network to care for them in their old days.</p><p>In a context where households are large and often include members of the extended family <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(De Vreyer and Nilsson 2019)</ref>, this means that children often end up residing with elderly relatives and attending to their needs <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Antoine and Gning 2014)</ref>.</p><p>There is evidence in the qualitative literature on Senegal that girls in particular are expected to help their dependent elders accomplish basic health and personal activities such as bathing, eating, dressing up, using the toilet or taking medications for instance <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Evans 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Evans et al. 2016)</ref>. This raises the question of how female children cope with the workload and with the constant attention required by such caregiving responsibilities. Indeed, if informal caregiving claims a significant share of the time of the girls who reside with young children, elderly adults or chronically ill relatives, it might displace other activities such as schooling. Even for those who dedicate small amounts of time to informal care, the surveillance required by dependent relatives might constrain the time spent outside of home and result in a higher rate of school absenteeism relative to children who are not involved in caregiving. The stress induced by such responsibilities, and the associated cognitive load, are another channel through which the school progression of young caregivers could be impacted <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Mani et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Lichand and Mani 2020)</ref>.</p><p>This paper evaluates the effect of elderly household members' deaths on the educational attainment of female children. To do so, I use longitudinal data on a sample of 1,005 children who were enrolled in school and resided with an elderly individual at the beginning of the study period. I exploit the deaths of elderly co-residents which occurred between the baseline survey conducted in 2006-2007 and a follow-up survey conducted approximately four years later. The assumption motivating this analysis is that old age individuals are net positive consumers of informal caregiving, i.e they consume on average more informal caregiving than they provide to their co-residents. I discuss the plausibility of this assumption later in the paper. As such, the death of an elderly household member should result in a negative shock of informal caregiving demand for the remaining members of the household. My testable prediction is that this shock will result in better educational attainment for treated children relative to other children with elderly co-residents. I expect this effect to exist mainly for girls since very few boys have caregiving responsibilities: 5% of them do any caregiving work in the baseline sample of interest.</p><p>21% of the Senegalese schoolgirls who resided with adults aged 60 or more in 2007 experienced the death of an elderly household member during the period under consideration. To evaluate the effects of this death shock (the treatment) I use a triple difference strategy (DDD) which compares treated and untreated children across time and gender. The econometric model includes individual fixed-effects which address potential sources of bias from unobserved timeinvariant differences between children who lost an elderly co-resident during the study period and children who were not exposed to the shock. I add boys to the analysis to account for differential trends along non-sex-specific time-varying variables between treated and untreated children. This approach follows <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Jayachandran and Lleras-Muney (2009)</ref> and relies on a specific form of the parallel trends assumption in which relative outcomes in the treatment and control groups are assumed to trend similarly in the pre-treatment period <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Olden and Møen 2022)</ref>. I provide evidence showing that this assumption is likely to be satisfied in the present study.</p><p>The results suggest that co-residing with an elderly relative significantly constrains the ability of young girls to maximize their educational attainment. I find that being exposed to the death of an elderly household member results in approximately 0.6 years of extra education completed by the treated girls during the study period, a 20% gain compared to the mean educational attainment in the control group at baseline. I also find a direct effect of death shocks on the intensive margin of caregiving work, and in particular on the probability of dedicating a very large number of hours (more than 15 hours per week) to caregiving activities.</p><p>I show that the effects of the treatment on both schooling and caregiving outcomes are concentrated among girls aged 12-17 at baseline. This points to the fact that female teenagers in particular are in charge of attending to the needs of their elders. This is in line with the literature on informal caregiving in sub-Saharan Africa <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Edmonds, Mammen, and Miller 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Evans et al. 2016</ref>) which highlights the role of female adolescents in caring for dependent relatives. I also present evidence that the effects on educational attainment are driven by girls whose co-residing elderly relative had a low level of economic productivity, a proxy variable used to account for the level of functional autonomy of deceased individuals.</p><p>The primary contribution of this paper is to provide novel evidence of the impact of grandparents and other old relatives' deaths on the educational attainment of female children in the African context. The analysis builds on a substantial body of literature examining the effects of death shocks on the well-being of children and women <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Ainsworth, Beegle, and Koda 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Beegle, De Weerdt, and Dercon 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Evans and Miguel 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">De Vreyer and Nilsson 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Villar 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Khanna and Pandey 2024)</ref>.

In addition to presenting empirical evidence on the impacts of elderly death shocks on the accumulation of human capital by girls, this article also extends the literature on caregiving and development by presenting some new evidence on the involvement of female teenagers in informal elderly care activities.</p><p>Second, the paper also contributes to the literature on the interaction between household investment decisions, gender norms, and inequalities in access to education <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">(Thomas 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Garg and Morduch 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Morduch 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Duflo 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Lundberg 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Qian 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Akresh, Walque, and Kazianga 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Benhassine et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Ringdal and Sjursen 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Dhar, Jain, and Jayachandran 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Dizon-Ross and Jayachandran 2023)</ref>. My results show that gender norms in domestic work have implications for gender inequalities in education.

It is one of the rare contributions to document the impacts of domestic work as opposed to market work on schooling outcomes<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">2</ref> , and it extends the literature on this specific topic by highlighting the impacts of caregiving as a particular type of domestic work.</p><p>The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Informal caregiving to elderly relatives and children's schooling</head><p>The literature on children caregivers in AIDS-affected households mainly documents their role in caring for prime-age adults. Unfortunately, much less has been published on children's involvement in caring for their aged relatives but the available evidence suggests that girls, and first-born daughters in particular, have a comparative advantage in caring for elderly family members in the context of sub-Saharan Africa <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Edmonds, Mammen, and Miller 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Evans et al. 2016)</ref>. Prior research suggests at least three potential pathways through which caregiving responsibilities may reduce educational attainment, particularly for female children.</p><p>First, demand for caregiving within the household could compete with school time and constrain children to drop out of school or miss school frequently as is the case for other types of child labor <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Ravallion and Wodon 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Assaad, Levison, and Zibani 2010)</ref>. Furthermore, the relationship between informal caregiving time and schooling hours may not be proportional.</p><p>The distribution of caregiving hours during the week or their low predictability could result in disproportionate impacts on school attendance. This would be the case if the time at which specific tasks need to be conducted is fixed and coincides with school hours, for example if a child was in charge of helping a grand-parent to bath, to dress up, to eat or to take a medication. In this type of situation, low intensity caregiving work could nevertheless lead to increased absenteeism and affect learning, exam performances and school progression in the medium term.</p><p>Second, even in situations where female children were able to conduct caregiving work without missing school, caregiving could still compete with time dedicated to homework and affect learning and educational attainment through this channel. There is evidence in the empirical literature that schoolchildren who work underperform in reading and mathematics tests, even when they mainly supply household work or only work on an occasional basis <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Gunnarsson, Orazem, and Sánchez 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Kassouf, Tiberti, and Garcias 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Third, the responsibility of caring for a dependent relative requires significant mental attention and can generate stress for a child who suddenly becomes in charge of the life of another person. This implies that caregiving responsibilities can be a source of cognitive load as defined by <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Mullainathan and Shafir (2013)</ref>: reduced available attention to matters other than caregiving work in our case. This cognitive load could affect learning and educational attainment through impaired cognitive function and reduced in-class attention among female child caregivers <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Mani et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Howard et al. 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Lichand and Mani 2020)</ref>. There are thus reasons to believe that learning can be negatively affected even in situations where children caregivers attend school as regularly as other children.  Measurement error is a well-known problem in self-reported time-use data. Common issues include recall bias, proxy reporting error, response fatigue, and social desirability bias. Except for social desirability bias, these sources of measurement error are likely to lead to loss of precision and attenuation bias rather than systematic over or under-reporting. Social desirability bias <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Nederhof 1985)</ref> is a greater source of concern because it could lead to systematic underreporting of some activities, with both its incidence and magnitude potentially differing between study groups. For instance, in the case of children reporting their hours of domestic work, male respondents might be tempted to under-report their time spent on activities which are more frequently ascribed to women while female respondents might be doing the opposite. Although this can be an issue when working with cross-sectional data, this paper uses longitudinal data and its main results are based on econometric models which incorporate individual fixed effects.</p><p>Assuming that an individual's sensitivity to social desirability is stable over time, the fixed effects should control for this unobservable characteristic.</p><p>Another issue with time use data is the fact that summing the time reported by an individual for all of her activities can result in totals which exceed the maximum number of hours available in a week (112 hours if one assumes 8 hours of sleep and leisure per day). This can be due to the fact that some activities can be conducted concomitantly but also reflects measurement error with individuals reporting an unrealistically high number of hours for some activities. To deal with this problem, I winsorize all time use variables, including informal caregiving time, at the 99th percentile 4 .</p><p>The analysis focuses on two main outcomes of interest: current school enrollment and educational attainment. School enrollment is measured by an indicator variable equal to one if a child is currently enrolled in school at the time of the survey and to zero otherwise 5 . Educational attainment or years of education is a variable equal to the number of years of formal education completed at the time of the survey. The variable ranges from 0 to 17 which reflects the fact that the Senegalese schooling system includes 6 years of primary school, 4 years of middle school, 3 years of high school, and that higher education is recorded up to 4 years after high school.</p><p>Finally, my treatment variable of interest is an indicator variable equal to one in wave 2 if the wave 1 household hosted an individual aged 60 or more who died between the two waves of the survey (and to zero otherwise The descriptive statistics on child labor also reflect important differences between genders.</p><p>In line with the qualitative literature on child labor in Senegal <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Evans et al. 2016</ref>) I find that girls tend to specialize in domestic work and caregiving work while boys are more likely to be doing market work. These differences increase as children grow older so that girls are 37 percentage points (0.82-0.45) more likely to report some domestic work and 21 percentage points (0.24-0.45) less likely to be doing market work at the end of the study period. Turning to caregiving 6. Among adults. 7. This difference is significant at the 1% level in unequal variance t-tests on the equality of means.</p><p>work in particular, it is striking that this is an almost exclusively feminine activity. Only 5.6% of boys were doing any caregiving work at all at baseline, while 21% of girls were caring for a relative. As a result, the average time spent on informal caregiving is close to zero for boys while girls dedicate 1.7 hours of their time to this activity every week on average (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, top panel). This corresponds to close to 8 hours of caregiving work per week for the subgroup of female caregivers (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, bottom panel).</p><p>Importantly, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>  </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Identification strategy and estimating equations</head><p>My empirical strategy uses the deaths of elderly resident household members which occurred between the two waves of PSF as a source of variation in demand for caregiving work. To exploit these death shocks, I restrict my sample of interest to the children who resided with an elderly adult at baseline. This ensures that all the children considered in the analysis had a  <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Hirano and Imbens 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Brunell and DiNardo 2004)</ref> for the control group. Differences between the treated and control means are presented in columns 3 and 6, using the unweighted control means (column 1 -column 2) and the inverse propensity score reweighted control means (column 1 -column 5) respectively. Missing observations are imputed using multivariate normal multiple imputation <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(Schafer 1997)</ref> for the variables years of education completed, completed primary school, and hours of domestic work per week. The standard errors on the differences are estimated from running the corresponding least squares regression allowing for the errors to be clustered by household. *** p&lt;0.01, ** p&lt;0.05, * p&lt;0.1</p><p>non-zero probability of being treated and share the unobservable characteristics associated with this type of co-residence. I further restrict the sample to the children who were in school at the time of the first survey for similar reasons, because children who had already dropped out of school at baseline had a much lower probability to see their educational attainment affected by the death or survival of an elderly co-resident. Appendix Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_16">C</ref>.2 shows that the resulting sample includes 1,005 school children of whom 217 (21.6%) were exposed to the death shock of interest between the two waves.</p><p>While this choice of inclusion criteria allows me to compare treated and control children who are relatively similar socio-economic characteristics and are likely to react to the treatment, the resulting analytical sample is selected and includes only 28.3% of all children in the age group of interest (1,005 out of 3,556). Appendix Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_16">C</ref>.3 shows that included children came from larger households, had more years of education and were less likely to be conducting market work at baseline. To ensure that the conclusions of the paper are not driven by selection bias, I also conduct my main analysis in two extended samples: the sample of children aged 6-17 who were co-residing with an elderly adult in wave 1 irrespective of their school enrollment status</p><p>(1,757 children), and the broadest possible sample including all panel children aged 6-17 in wave 1 (3,556 children). In the robustness checks section of the paper, I show that the results of the main analysis are qualitatively similar when considering these alternative samples instead of the main analytical sample. Another important feature of the analytical sample is that it is less affected by attrition than the overall sample: 90.5% (1,062 out of 1,173) of the children who were included in the wave 1 survey were tracked in wave 2 and 85,7% (1,005 out of 1,173) have sufficiently complete data for the outcomes and covariates of interest in the two survey waves to be included in the analysis 8 .</p><p>I estimate the impact of the death shocks on girls' schooling outcomes by comparing the girls who were exposed to the shock (treated girls) to those who did not lose an elderly household member between wave 1 and wave 2 (control girls). The second dimension of the comparison is over time. In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">1</ref>, I compare treated and control girls on their observables as a first check of the pre-treatment differences between the two groups. Column 3 of the table shows that treated girls had completed 0.5 less years of education at the beginning of the study period. They were 10 percentage points more likely to be conducting domestic work and 6 percentage points less likely to be involved in market work than the control group. As a result, they dedicated 1.5</p><p>8. A detailed analysis of attrition rates is presented in Appendix Figure B.4 and Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_16">C</ref>.17.</p><p>hours less of their time to market work. This is consistent with a situation in which the elderly individuals with whom treated girls were living at baseline were in worse physical condition and required more support than those who were living with the control girls, as illustrated by the large differences in the mean age and number of productive hours per week of elderly coresidents. Last, treated girls were significantly less likely to live in female headed households.</p><p>There are also some baseline differences between the two groups of boys.</p><p>These baseline differences on some of my key outcomes of interest represent a threat to identification in a standard difference-in-differences (DID) design. The differences in educational attainment between treated and control girls in particular could reflect pre-treatment differences in trends given that girls are of the same age on average in the two groups. An additional limitation is that it is difficult to test the parallel trends assumption directly through a standard test of pre-trends with the data at hand because PSF is a two-wave survey.</p><p>I address this issue in two ways. First, I estimate econometric models which include child fixed-effects so that comparisons are within child-period cells. The child fixed-effects are particularly useful in ensuring that the estimations are not confounded by differences on time-invariant variables such as early childhood human capital accumulated prior to the age of 6 or innate abilities between treated and control children. This assumption is easier to satisfy than the parallel trends assumption in standard DID designs because the addition of boys to the comparison differences out the bias from non-gender-specific unobservable differences between girls from treated households and comparison households (see Olden and Møen 2022, for a formal discussion). Put differently, if the parallel trends assumption is violated for both girls and boys and the resulting bias is not gender-specific, the addition of a third difference across genders can effectively remove this bias. Since the assumption of parallel trends cannot be tested in a standard way with the PSF data, I conduct a cross-sectional placebo test comparing the relative outcomes of girls and boys across age cohorts at baseline to provide support for a causal interpretation of the triple-difference coefficients.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.2">Testing for parallel trends</head><p>Olden and Møen (2022) show that the triple difference estimator can be written as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">δtriple = [( Ȳgirl,pre,treat -Ȳboy,pre,treat ) -( Ȳgirl,post,treat -Ȳboy,post,treat )] -[( Ȳgirl,pre,cont -Ȳboy,pre,cont ) -( Ȳgirl,post,cont -Ȳboy,post,cont )]<label>(2)</label></formula><p>The assumption of parallel trends on relative outcomes requires that δtriple = 0 in pre-treatment periods.

Because my sample is small, I use the first three cohorts, children aged between 6 and 8 at baseline, as the reference category.</p><p>Assuming that relative trends in education and domestic work are not cohort-specific, differential trends over time should also be captured by relative differences across cohorts. Thus, if the difference in educational gender gap which appears in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">1</ref> 10 is due to a different relative trend in educational attainment rather than to an age composition effect 11 , these differences should be detected by the proposed placebo tests.</p><p>I report the results of the tests in Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> for educational attainment, for the probability that a child reports being involved in caregiving activities and for the number of hours of caregiving generally conducted in a normal week of the month preceding the survey. Note that I cannot conduct the test for the probability of being enrolled in school because the analytical sample is restricted to children who were attending school at baseline. The placebo coefficients are generally small and statistically insignificant for each of the three outcomes, with only a handful of exceptions. Where the coefficients differ from zero, there is no particular pattern which would suggest that the relative outcomes were trending differently across cohorts at the beginning of the study period. These results are reassuring regarding the feasibility of estimating the effects of elderly death shocks using the proposed strategy.</p><p>Several limitations of these placebo tests are worth highlighting. First, they rely on the untestable assumption that pre-treatment relative trends in education and caregiving responsibilities were similar across age cohorts within the treated group on one hand and within the control group on the other, so that observed differences between cohorts can serve as proxies for the pre-treatment trends of the treated and control groups. Second, they only support a causal interpretation of the triple-difference coefficients under the additional assumption that age or cohort-related factors affect treated and control cohorts similarly. Third, they may be subject to sampling bias because the PSF survey was designed to be representative at the national level but not by age cohort. 10. +1.37 years of education for boys relative to girls in the treatment group, -0.02 years for boys relative to girls in the control group.</p><p>11. Boys in the treatment group are on average 1.4 years older than treated girls and 0.9 years older than control boys.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.3">Inverse propensity score reweighting</head><p>As an additional check of the robustness of the main results, I also estimate an inverse propensity score weighted (IPW) version of Equation 1 following the approach developed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Hirano and Imbens (2001)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Brunell and DiNardo (2004)</ref>. I obtain the propensity scores from a logit model in which I regress the treatment variable on a vector of baseline covariates X 12 . In order to recover an unbiased estimate of the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT), I then derive the weights ω T and ω c for the treatment and the control group respectively as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">ω T i = 1 and ω c i = P r(T = 1|X i ) 1 -P r(T = 1|X i ) × p c p T (4)</formula><p>where p c is the proportion of control observations and p T is the proportion of treated observations. The coefficients in column 6 of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">1</ref> and the p-values on the F-test of joint significance reported in the last row of each panel show that the IPW procedure successfully removes baseline differences on the outcomes of interest and on selected covariates in the female and in the male subsamples 13 . This suggests that including the inverse propensity weights in the estimation of the treatment effects is helpful to reduce bias from pre-treatment differences in trends and levels and provides more robust results. Nevertheless, I interpret my results with caution in what follows given my inability to conduct a conventional test of pre-trends.</p><p>12. The list of covariates includes: the household size, the number of elderly co-residents, the mean age of the elderly co-residents, the mean hours of productive work of elderly co-residents, the age of the household head, the household's per capita food and non-food expenditure, an index of asset ownership, the child's age, educational attainment, market work, domestic work and caregiving work, as well as dummy variables for male elderly coresidents, female headed households, polygamous household heads, first born household heads, urban households and households with access to electricity. Missing values on some of these outcomes are handled using stochastic imputation to compute a propensity score for each individual in the analytical sample.</p><p>13.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.1">Schooling outcomes</head><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">2</ref> reports results from triple difference estimations for the schooling outcomes of interest.</p><p>The first and second columns show the results for school enrollment. The unweighted coefficient on death shock x female in column 1 is positive as expected but statistically insignificant.</p><p>Column 2 presents the results estimated with inverse propensity weights. The coefficient on the interaction between death shock and female remains insignificant in this specification. Note that the Wald test of joint significance of the coefficients on death shock and death shock x female is significant at the 5% level (see last row of the table), suggesting that female children who were exposed to the death shock are more likely to still be enrolled in school than they would be in the absence of treatment when taking into account both the female-specific effect of the death shock (coefficient β 3 in Equation <ref type="formula">1</ref>) and the effect which is common to boys and girls (coefficient β 1 in Equation <ref type="formula">1</ref>). However, given the statistical insignificance of the coefficient on death shock x female, I cannot rule out that the effect for girls and boys is similar.</p><p>In column 3, I turn to the effect of the treatment on the educational attainment of female children. The coefficient of interest is positive and statistically significant. The estimate implies that the difference in years of education completed by treated girls relative to control girls represents approximately 0.6 years of extra education after adjusting for the same comparison among boys. To assess the relative magnitude of this effect, one can compare it to the average educational attainment in the reference group before treatment (boys in wave 1) which is captured by the constant term. This comparison shows that the effect of the death shock on girls represents a 20% increase in educational attainment. This result is robust to the inclusion of inverse propensity score weights and the magnitude of the effect is nearly unchanged in this case (column 4). The Wald test of joint significance of the coefficients on death shock and death shock x female is significant at the 5% level, which confirms that there is a gain in education accumulated during the study period for treated girls when both the female-specific effect and the non-gender-specific effect of the death shock are taken into account. Note that the small and statistically insignificant coefficients on death shock suggest that there is no treatment effect on schooling outcomes for boys.</p><p>Columns 5 and 6 of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">2</ref> estimate the effect of the death shock on the probability that children completed their primary school curriculum during the study period. The coefficient of interest is large in both specifications and statistically significant at the 10% level in column 6 when the IPW procedure is used. The latter coefficient suggests that the relative effect of the death shock on treated girls is a 17 percentage points increase in the probability to have completed primary school. This represents 85% of the baseline primary school completion rate among boys. I obtain very similar results when I exclude boys from the analysis and conduct a simple difference-in-differences analysis of the impacts of elderly death shocks in the sub-sample of girls as shown in columns 1 to 3 of Appendix Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_16">C</ref>.5.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.2">Mechanisms</head><p>To see if a reduction in caregiving responsibilities could be one of the channels through which elderly death shocks affect educational attainment, I next analyze the time use data collected in both waves of PSF. In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">3</ref>, I present results from running triple difference (DDD) estimations of the impact of the death shocks on caregiving work outcomes. Columns 1 and 2 show DDD results for the number of weekly caregiving work hours reported by the respondents. The coefficient of interest is negative and statistically significant at the 10% level in column 1.</p><p>When the inverse propensity weights are included in the estimation, the treatment effect is no longer precisely estimated although the sign on the coefficient of interest remains negative (column 2).</p><p>Columns 3 to 10 of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">3</ref> break down the analysis by intervals of the distribution of caregiving work hours. They report linear probability estimates of the relationship between elderly adult death shocks and the probability of falling into each interval. Columns 3 and 4 report coefficients for the probability of not having cared for anyone in the previous month.</p><p>They inform us on the effect of the death shock on the extensive margin of caring. The positive signs on the coefficients for death shock x female are consistent with a negative relationship between the death of an elderly household member and the probability of caring. However, the estimates are imprecise.</p><p>At the other end of the distribution, in columns 9 and 10, there is a negative effect of the death shocks on the probability that female children dedicate more than 15 hours per week to providing informal care to their relatives. This result is statistically significant at the 5% level in the IPW estimation and the effect size of 3.8 percentage points is large considering that the baseline probability of conducting any caregiving work was 0.23 among treated girls and 0.13 among control girls (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">1</ref>). Given that the coefficients corresponding to a moderate burden of caring are statistically insignificant and relatively small (columns 5 to 8), it appears that the main effect of elderly adult deaths on caregiving activities is a decrease in the proportion of girls who dedicate very large amounts of time to caring for their relatives. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.3">Heterogeneity analysis</head><p>Disaggregating the results by age group provides a more refined understanding of the treatment effects on schooling and caregiving outcomes. In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">4</ref>, I consider the effects of death shocks on younger and older children separately 15 . The coefficients of interest are statistically insignificant for all outcomes irrespective of the specification when looking at girls aged 6 to 11 in wave 1.</p><p>On the other hand, the analysis points to a significant positive effect of the death shocks on the intensive margin of schooling when considering the group of girls aged 12-17. This result is matched by large and significant coefficients on death shock x female for the caregiving outcomes.</p><p>The fact that the positive impact of elderly death shocks on schooling outcomes is paralleled by a negative effect on caregiving work and that these effects are concentrated in the same age group supports this paper's core hypothesis: namely, that elderly deaths have a positive</p><p>14. This index combines the three outcome variables studied in impact on girls' schooling because they result in a negative shock of demand for caregiving work.</p><p>Interestingly, the effects are observed among the girls who were already teenagers at the time of the first survey, showing that female teenagers and young adults play a specific role in terms of informal care provision in Senegalese households. This is in line with the available qualitative literature on this topic <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Evans 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Evans et al. 2016)</ref>.</p><p>To provide more evidence in support of these key findings, I also investigate the relationship between the effect of the death shock and the level of dependency of the deceased person at baseline. Unfortunately, the PSF questionnaire does not include a direct measure of a respondent's functional autonomy. As a proxy, I compute the total productivity of each respondent by summing their reported market and domestic work hours. I then assign elderly respondents to a highly productive group and a less productive group based on their total productive hours using mean productive hours in the group of respondents aged 60 or more at baseline as the cut-off point between the two groups. While the validity of such a proxy would be questionable in a country where a majority of workers are covered by a retirement pension scheme, leisure time is less likely to increase after retirement age in Senegal where pension coverage is very low. As a result, decreases in productivity at old age are more likely to be involuntary and to correspond to a decline in functional autonomy.</p><p>In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">5</ref>, I replicate my analysis with separate treatment variables for the death of an elderly individual who was highly productive at baseline and for the death of a person whose productive time was below the mean of 20 hours per week. I find clear evidence of treatment effects among the girls who were exposed to the death of a less productive elderly adult. The coefficients on death shock (low productivity) x female are significant for all schooling ouctomes in the IPW specification. The signs and magnitudes of the effects are very similar to what was found in the main analysis. On the other hand, the coefficients on death shock (high productivity) x female are generally smaller and are always statistically insignificant 16 . This tends to show that my main results are driven by the deaths of functionally dependent elderly individuals and constitutes additional suggestive evidence that changes in demand for informal caregiving might be behind the observed impacts of elderly death shocks on the outcomes of interest.</p><p>16. However, in Wald tests I cannot reject the null-hypothesis that the coefficients on these two terms are equivalent for any of the schooling or caregiving outcomes, potentially due to the small size of my sample. Last, the mechanisms underlying the treatment effects on girls' education could also pertain to the specific structure of households in Senegal where polygamy is common. Prior research on polygamous households has shown that children of co-wives of higher rank tend to receive less human capital investment than those of first wives <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">(Strauss 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Matz 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Mammen 2019)</ref>. Daughters of second or third wives may therefore bear a greater share of the burden of domestic tasks as a result, and they also have older fathers on average. The effect of the death shocks could thus be driven by polygamous households and, in particular, by daughters of women with higher spousal ranks. I test this hypothesis in Appendix Tables C.9 and C.10, first by estimating DDD results separately for the subsample of children who were living in households headed by polygamous and non-polygamous households at baseline, and second by comparing children living under the responsibility of a co-wife of higher rank to other children.</p><p>The first heterogeneity analysis shows no significant difference in treatment effects between girls living in polygamous households and other girls when children of first wives and higher ranked wives are considered together. On the other hand, the second heterogeneity analysis suggests that the impacts of the death shocks on educational attainment are particularly pronounced for girls placed under the responsibility of a co-wife of high rank. The estimated difference in educational attainment is 1.5 years for treated girls in this subsample (p-value = 0.053). This suggests that daughters of higher-ranked co-wives are a particularly vulnerable group and should be a key target for policy interventions seeking to mitigate the gendered consequences of old-age dependency. However, the analysis lacks power due to the small size of the sub-sample of children living with cell heads of higher spousal rank and I cannot reject that the effects of the death shocks are similar for girls living with a co-wife of higher rank and for other girls 17 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.4">Other outcomes</head><p>I move on to testing a range of potential alternative mechanisms which could also explain the effect of elderly death shocks on treated girls' schooling outcomes and thus confound my analysis. In columns 1 to 4 of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">6</ref>, I investigate the effect of the treatment on two other dimensions of children's time use, domestic work and market work, using the IPW specification.</p><p>The coefficients of interest are positive for the intensive and extensive margin of these two outcomes but they are very imprecisely estimated. Thus, the analysis does not provide clear evidence that the death shocks result in a change in the allocation of girls' time to market and non-market productive activities other than caregiving work 18 .</p><p>In columns 5 to 9 of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">6</ref>, I estimate the impact of the death of an elderly household member on a range of other outcomes including household size, total per capita household expenditure and per capita schooling expenditure in the household of residence, as well as whether the household of residence is female headed and whether the respondent reports being a foster child. The treatment effect on household size is of interest because if elderly adults tend to be negative net contributors to the budget of their household of residence, their death could result in a positive consumption shock for the remaining household members which could also positively affect children's ability to attend school and to accumulate human capital. I could thus be mistaking the effect of a negative shock of demand for informal care for that of a consumption shock. In this case, I would expect the coefficient of interest to be negative and significant in column 5 which reports estimates of the treatment effect on household size and positive and significant in column 6 which shows results for the impact on household per capita consumption. This is not what I find. The triple difference coefficient is positive and statistically significant when estimating the treatment effect on household size but the test of joint significance for the coefficients on death shock and death shock x female has a p-value of 0.67. Thus, there is no specific effect of the death shocks on household size when both the girl-specific effect and the effect which is common to treated girls and treated boys are taken into account. The lack of effect of the death shock on household size is somewhat surprising at first glance but can be explained by the fact that 15% of children in the analytical sample belonged to a different household in wave 1 and in wave 2 19 . The coefficients of interest for log per capita expenditure also suggest that there is no treatment effect for this outcome.</p><p>Column 7 looks at the effect of the death on the allocation of resources within the household and in particular on per capita schooling expenditure. The coefficient of interest is once again insignificant as is the test of joint significance for this outcome, suggesting that we can rule out direct investments in human capital as a potential channel for the effect of elderly death shocks on educational attainment. coefficient on death shock x female is small and insignificant. However, the coefficient on death shock alone equals 0.25 and has a p-value of less than 0.01. This coefficient indicates that there is a positive impact of the death shock on the probability of living in a female headed household for girls and boys alike. This could be a source of concern for my identification strategy if female household heads happen to be more prone to investing in their children's education than their male counterparts. To assess the extent of the problem, I re-estimate the regressions from Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">2</ref> after restricting my sample to the children who live in a male headed household in both waves of PSF. The results are displayed in Appendix Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_16">C</ref>.14. The effects observed in the main sample of interest are robust to this test and, if anything, statistically more significant. This rules out the possibility that the effect of elderly death shocks on girls' schooling are entirely driven by children who end up living in a female headed household after the death of an elderly relative.</p><p>Finally, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">6</ref> column 9 shows that exposure to the shock associated with the death of an old age household member does not increase the probability that the child was fostered out to a household other than his parents' household at the time of the wave 2 survey. A statistically significant effect of the treatment on this outcome would have questioned the role of changes in demand for informal caregiving as the main mechanism explaining my results</p><p>because previous research has shown that changes in household structure, and in particular the fostering of children out of their parents' household, could be associated with improvements in school enrollment and educational attainment in the context of West Africa <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Akresh 2004)</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Selection bias</head><p>To address potential concerns regarding sample selection, I estimate Equation 1 for the key ouctomes of interest after extending the analytical sample to the categories of children which were initially excluded from the analysis. First, I extend the sample to children who were not enrolled in school at baseline but were living with an elderly relative. The results presented in Appendix Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_16">C</ref>.15 are very similar to the main results with statistically significant effects on the main coefficient of interest for the number of years of education completed, for the number of hours of caregiving per week and for the probability to be conducting more than 15 hours of caregiving per week. The sign and magnitude of these effects are comparable to what I find in Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">2</ref> and<ref type="table" target="#tab_4">3</ref>. The conclusions of the analysis are therefore unchanged when the children whose relative's needs were important enough to prevent enrollment as of wave 1 are also considered.</p><p>In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_16">C</ref>.16, I further extend the sample to include all panel children aged 6-17 with complete data, including those who were not living with an elderly person at baseline. The results are again robust to this change of sample definition, which allows me to completely rule out the fact that the paper's main findings are driven by the choice to focus on a particular sub-sample of children.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Missing data</head><p>As previously mentioned, there is approximately 10% attrition in the analytical sample and a similar proportion of missing data for educational attainment. This could bias my results if missing educational attainment data are not random and happen to be correlated with unobserved predictors of education and with the death shocks. In Appendix Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_16">C</ref>.17, I show that the differential attrition rate between observations from households in which an elderly death occurred between waves and observations from control households is only 0.9%. Despite the absence of differential attrition, selection into attrition could nevertheless introduce bias in my analysis.</p><p>To assess the extent of this issue, I estimate a Heckman selection model which corrects for the potential bias from non-random missing values <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Heckman 1979</ref>). In the first step, I estimate the probability of attrition and missing data on the ouctome variables in any of the two survey waves using a probit. This probit model uses two sets of excluded variables. First, PSF data collection took place over relatively long time periods and data quality likely varied from month to month during each survey wave. Seasonal factors such as rainy seasons or summer vacation periods could have affected the data collection process for instance. So, I use a series of dummies for the month and year in which the household was interviewed as excluded variables. Second, I follow De <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Vreyer and Nilsson (2019)</ref> and also include a series of dummies indicating the identity of the supervisor in charge of the team which tracked and interviewed the household. This second set of excluded variables exploits idiosyncratic differences in skills between supervisors to account for missing values. Overall, both sets of excluded variables are likely to be good predictors of missing data while being uncorrelated with unobserved predictors of the outcome of interest.</p><p>The first stage results (not shown) suggest that the sets of excluded variables predict missing outcomes relatively well (χ 2 comprised between 50 and 80, p-values ranging from 0.0001 to 0.002). The second step of the model is estimated in first differences to remove the fixed effects as suggested in <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Wooldridge (2010)</ref>. The second step results are presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_16">C</ref>.18.</p><p>The coefficient on the inverse Mills ratio is statistically significant for school enrollment, the extensive margin of caregiving and the caregiving index, suggesting that missing values are indeed non-random. The corrected coefficients on death shock x female are generally similar to those presented in my main analysis, with statistically significant coefficients for educational attainment, the education index, high caregiving hours, and the caregiving index. Correcting for non-random missing data therefore leaves the initial findings essentially unchanged regarding the impact of elderly death shocks on girls educational attainment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Alternative treatment definitions</head><p>The somewhat arbitrary age limit used to define the elderly population category is another area of potential concern. Note that modifying this definition affects both the boundaries of the subsample of interest and the treatment itself. and the number of treated children by 7%. The results remain very similar to the main findings presented in Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">2</ref> and<ref type="table" target="#tab_4">3</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">Spillovers</head><p>Intra-household spillovers are a well-known threat to identification in the case of approaches which compare female and male children within the same households. In the present situation, the estimated coefficients for the impact of elderly deaths on girls' education could be biased upwards if the fact that girls tend to attend school more regularly leads boys to reduce their own school hours. From a theoretical perspective however, there are few reasons to think that such spillovers are at play.</p><p>First, human capital investment theory suggests that parents will tend to invest more in the education of the children with the highest returns to education in a context of resource and credit constraints. This is the sibling rivalry theory which predicts that male childrens education tends to get priority when there is pro-male bias in returns as is most likely the case in Senegal <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Garg and Morduch 1998)</ref>. It therefore seems unlikely that treated households would keep their daughters in school at the expense of their sons' education. The fact that the non-interacted coefficients on the death shock in my DDD specification in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">2</ref> are close to zero and statistically insignificant supports this line of thought 20 .</p><p>Second, considering that girls tend to specialize in domestic work, negative spillover effects on boys would most likely occur if the treatment led female children to reduce their domestic work hours in order to attend school. As mentioned before, the results presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">6</ref> for domestic work ouctomes do not point to a clear negative effect of elderly adult deaths on these outcomes among treated girls. This questions the plausibility of a negative spillover effect through that channel.</p><p>Finally, the existing empirical literature in the economics of education tends to point towards positive rather than negative spillovers on boys from interventions aimed at increasing girls' school attendance <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Kim, Alderman, and Orazem 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Kazianga, Walque, and Alderman 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Kazianga et al. 2013</ref>). If such positive spillovers were at play in the case of elderly death shocks, the above analysis would be underestimating the positive impact of the shocks on girls' school enrollment and educational attainment 21 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.5">Implications for literacy skills in adulthood</head><p>The findings of this paper suggest that informal caregiving displaces schooling for the most intensive caregivers and causes them to drop out of school, to attend school less frequently, or to learn less than they would have done in the absence of caregiving duties. This caregiving penalty seems to affect teenage girls in particular. Do the months of education lost by the girls who resided with an elderly adult throughout the study period make a difference in terms of actual skill retention in early adulthood? To provide suggestive evidence on this matter, I 20. In Appendix Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_16">C</ref>.6 I also estimate the treatment effects separately for the male sub-sample using a difference-in-difference specification with inverse propensity weights.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusion</head><p>In this article, I document the involvement of children, and especially girls, in the provision of informal caregiving to their relatives in the context of Senegal. I also evaluate the effect of co-residence with elderly individuals and the associated caregiving responsibilities on the educational attainment of female children. I find that more than one in five girls in the age range 6-17 had some caring responsibilities in 2006-2007. This burden did not account for a very large share of their time: young female caregivers dedicated 8 hours per week to this task on average. However, my results suggest that having an elderly co-resident affected the educational outcomes of these young caregiver significantly.</p><p>To identify this impact, I exploit the deaths of elderly co-residents which occur during my 22. Female respondents in the control group had 6 years of education on average when interviewed for PSF 2. 23. See Appendix D for a more detailed presentation of the procedure. 24. Assuming a linear relationship between educational attainment and literacy, the 0.6 years of extra education completed by bereaved schoolgirls in my sample of interest would increase the probability of being a fluent reader at adult age by 20 percentage points.</p><p>study period and find that the schoolgirls who were affected by the death of an elderly household member between 2007 and 2010 completed approximately 0.6 years of additional education compared to girls who still resided with an elderly adult at the end of this period. I also find a direct effect of elderly death shocks on the intensive margin of caregiving: the proportion of bereaved girls dedicating more than 15 hours per week to caregiving tasks decreased significantly relative to the control as a result of the shock. The effects on both schooling and caregiving outcomes are driven by adolescent girls, whose involvement in caregiving tasks is well-documented in the literature on informal caregiving arrangements in Senegal. I provide evidence that changes in demand for caregiving are likely to be one of the mechanisms through which elderly deaths impact education. In particular, I show that deaths of less productive -and therefore most likely less autonomous -individuals seem to be driving the effects on educational attainment.</p><p>These results need to be interpreted with caution given the self-reported nature of the timeuse variables and the fact that the main identifying assumption of difference-in-difference designs cannot be tested directly with the available data. Nevertheless, taken together, the descriptive and analytical results call for greater policy attention to gender inequalities in elderly care work, as well as in other forms of care work such as household childcare. In Senegal, and in many other sub-Saharan African countries, female children work significantly more than their male counterparts when all forms of labor are taken into account, including domestic work and informal caregiving. It will be difficult to close the gender gap in education if this imbalance is not addressed. In particular, it appears that the lack of formal caregiving services in many sub-Saharan African countries increases the demand for female child labor and pushes many girls to leave school prematurely. Investing in public and private forms of formal elderly care and childcare could reduce that burden, and, in doing so, would improve the long-term welfare of African populations. This study also shows that gender norms influencing the organization of home production activities within the household have implications for gender inequalities in education. Further research is needed to assess how interventions aimed at reshaping these norms affect women's education and job market outcomes in developing countries.   <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Hirano and Imbens 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Brunell and DiNardo 2004)</ref> for the control group.

Source: PSF Survey, waves 1 and 2. Sample: Children aged 6-17 in wave 1 who co-resided with an elderly individual and were enrolled in school at the time of survey (panel observations only). Notes: Marginal effects computed following first-differenced logit estimation in columns 1-4 and generalized ordered logit estimation in columns 5-8. In columns 1 and 2, the dependent variable is ∆yi+1, the 1st difference of children's school enrollment plus 1. This variable takes the value 0 for children who dropped out of school between PSF wave 1 and wave 2 (first difference of school enrollment status equal to -1) and 1 for children who were still enrolled in school in wave 2 (first difference of school enrollment status equal to 0). The coefficients on the independent variables can thus be interpreted as the variable's effect on the probability to be enrolled in school in wave 2. For generalized ordered logit models (columns 5-8), I report marginal effects of the independent variables on the probability that the first-difference of the binary outcome variable is equal to -1 ("reduced outcome"), 0 ("unchanged outcome"), or 1 ("increased outcome").   </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Time dedicated to caregiving and other domestic work by task</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>This paper uses data from the Poverty and Family Structure survey (in French Enquête pauvreté et structure familiale, henceforth PSF), a two-wave panel survey covering a nationally representative sample of 1,800 Senegalese households in the first wave (De Vreyer et al. 2008) 3 . The data were collected from April 2006 to July 2007 (wave 1) and between October 2010 and December 2012 (wave 2). 13,269 (82%) of the 16,210 individuals who were interviewed at baseline were tracked and re-interviewed in the second wave of the survey. Panel observations with complete data include 3,556 children who were aged 6 to 17 in the first wave of PSF and who are the focus of this paper. Six years of age is the lower age bound for which PSF collected domestic work information in both waves. It also corresponds to the age at which children are expected to start primary school in Senegal. I restrict my analysis to individuals aged less than 18 at baseline because I am interested in identifying the effect of conducting caregiving work during childhood and teenage years on educational outcomes. The PSF questionnaire collected the usual data on each individual's education and market work. It also contains a detailed domestic work module. The domestic tasks covered by the module include: purchasing food and cooking meals, collecting wood, fetching water, cleaning the house, washing clothes, doing home improvements, looking after cattle, as well as caring for children, elderly or sick individuals. For each of these tasks, self-reported weekly hours of unpaid work are recorded with the following question: During a normal week of the past month, how many hours (in the week) did you spend on [activity]?. This paper makes extensive use of the data on caregiving which is defined as time dedicated to children, elderly or sick people in the survey questionnaire. This definition is not specific enough to exclude the possibility that hours of work reported as caregiving work overlap with hours reported for other domestic activities such as cooking, cleaning or doing the laundry. To take this risk into account, I treat caregiving work separately from other domestic tasks in my analysis and therefore report descriptive statistics and regression results separately for caregiving work, domestic work other 3. A more detailed presentation of the design of PSF is included in Appendix A.than caregiving work, and market work in what follows.</figDesc></figure>

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_6"><head>Finally</head><label></label><figDesc>, in Appendix TableC.7, I conduct a multiple hypothesis test in which I estimate the effect of the death shocks on an index combining the probability of conducting any caregiving work, the number of hours of caregiving work per week and the probability of conducting more than 15 hours of caregiving work per week. The index is constructed following the standardized inverse-covariance weighted average of indicators method proposed in<ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Anderson (2008)</ref> which takes into account the correlation between the components of the index. The results of the test confirm that the death shocks caused a relative decrease in caregiving work among treated girls with a negative standardized effect of 0.39 which is significant at the 10% level in both the unweighted and IPW specifications. In addition, in order to account for simultaneous effects of death shocks on caregiving and schooling outcomes, I also compute an education index 14 and estimate stepdown adjusted Romano-Wolf p-values controlling for the familywise error rate in a joint test of the treatment effect on the two indices<ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Romano and Wolf 2016)</ref>. The Romano-Wolf p-values reject the null hypothesis of no treatment effect for both the education index (p-value = 0.009) and the caregiving index (p-value = 0.069).</figDesc></figure>

In panel A, the sample is further restricted to children placed under the responsibility of a woman married to a polygamous husband and of spousal rank greater than one. These children are identified by splitting polygamous households in cells so that the head of household and other unaccompanied dependent members are grouped in one cell while the head's wives and their co-residing children each constitute a distinct cell as detailed in De<ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Vreyer and Nilsson (2019)</ref>. In panel B, the analytical subsample includes children living in polygamous households but whose cell head is not a co-wife of rank &gt; 1 as well as children living in non-polygamous households. Notes: Results from first-differenced inverse propensity score weighted WLS regressions. Linear probability models are used in columns 1, 3, 4, and 6.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Appendix A -Design of the Poverty and Family Structure survey</head><p>The PSF survey uses a standard two-stage cluster sampling strategy: 150 districts were randomly drawn from the map of Senegals census districts and 12 households were then randomly selected in each district. A specific feature of this survey is that 220 secondary households were added to the baseline household. These are the households in which non-resident spouses of the 1,800 primary household heads happened to be living at the time of the survey. These households were included in the sample because one of the goals of the research team which designed the survey was to study the intra-household allocation of resources in Senegal, accounting for the complex structure of polygamous households (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">De Vreyer and Lambert 2021)</ref>. Although this paper has a different focus, my analysis includes the individuals who belong to these secondary households to ensure that children living in polygamous households are not underrepresented in the sample. All wave 1 household members were tracked individually at wave 2, including those who had migrated to a different region of Senegal. A tracking sheet was filled out for each individual. It included a question on the survival status of the participant. This question was answered either directly by the surviving individuals or indirectly by other wave 1 household members for deceased individuals.  .</p></div>
