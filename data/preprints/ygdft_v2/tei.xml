			<abstract>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The Reversed Congruency Effect (RCE) typically observed with gaze targets has been rarely demonstrated with non-social stimuli like arrows targets. In a novel approach, we conducted two pre-registered experiments to investigate whether the RCE can be elicited using non-social stimuli (arrows) when directional information is visually masked. Participants performed a spatial Stroop task with arrows varying in perceptual complexity due to overlapping visual masks. Direction and spatial location were either congruent or incongruent. Remarkably, highly masked arrows elicited an RCE, with faster responses on incongruent trials. Distributional analyses showed reduced interference among the fastest responses and larger RCE in middle quantiles. Additionally, increased errors for both congruent and incongruent conditions were observed in the fastest responses, with congruent trials showing higher error rates, as previously observed with gaze targets. These findings suggest that the RCE reflects a dynamic interplay between early response capture and inhibitory control, shaped by the visual features of masked stimuli. Critically, they raise the possibility that similar perceptual constraints contribute to the RCE observed with gaze targets, offering a potential non-social mechanism underlying this effect. Our results highlight how visual complexity can modulate automatic activation and control processes, underscoring the value of distributional methods for revealing the temporal dynamics of interference.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Research on social attention often investigates whether gaze-driven orienting relies on general mechanisms for processing directional cues or on specialized processes for interpreting others' intentions <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Apperly &amp; Butterfill, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Cole &amp; Millett, 2019)</ref>. However, standard cueing paradigms yield similar effects for arrows and gaze <ref type="bibr">(Chacón-Candia et al., 2023)</ref>, underscoring the need for more information methods. One possibility is the recently widely used spatial interference paradigm <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Lu &amp; Proctor, 1995)</ref>, typically implemented using the spatial Stroop task (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Cañadas &amp; Lupiáñez, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr">Marotta et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>In this task, participants are asked to respond to the direction (left or right) indicated by a lateralized target, such as an arrow or a gaze, while ignoring its spatial location (i.e., whether it appears to the left or right of fixation). Trials are considered congruent when the direction indicated by the stimulus matches its spatial location (e.g., a rightpointing arrow on the right side of fixation) and incongruent when it does not (e.g., a right-pointing arrow on the left side of fixation). Non-social stimuli, such as arrows, typically produce a standard congruency effect (SCE), characterized by faster responses on congruent than incongruent trials. In contrast, gaze stimuli often elicit a reversed congruency effect (RCE), with faster responses on incongruent trials (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Hemmerich et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Ishikawa et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>The SCE is typically attributed to the asymmetric relationship between different stimulus dimensions, specifically, the task-relevant direction and the task-irrelevant spatial location relative to lateralized motor responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Lu &amp; Proctor, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b105">Viviani et al., 2024)</ref>. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Kornblum's (1992)</ref> taxonomy, this setup constitutes a Type 8 ensemble, characterized by Stimulus-Stimulus (S-S) and Stimulus-Response (S-R) dimensional overlap. Even when participants are explicitly instructed to focus on the relevant dimension (i.e., direction), spatial location still influences response selection and motor execution. This overlapping-dimensional interference suggests that conflict must be resolved at multiple levels such as task, stimulus, and response <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">(Viviani et al., 2024)</ref>.</p><p>The specific dynamics underlying the SCE have been further explained within the dual-route processing framework (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Ponce et al., 2025a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Ponce et al., , 2025b;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Tanaka et al., 2024</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Tanaka et al., , 2025a))</ref>. Although this framework has been predominantly applied to explain the dynamics of Simon and Simon-like tasks (S-R overlap, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Luo &amp; Proctor, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Scerrati et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Torres-Quesada et al., 2022)</ref>, its assumptions extend to the spatial Stroop task.</p><p>According to the dual-route framework information is processed along two parallel routes <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Cohen et al., 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">De Jong et al., 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Luo &amp; Proctor, 2017</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Mittelstädt &amp; Miller, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr">Ridderinkhof, 2002a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Ridderinkhof, , 2002b;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Ulrich et al., 2015)</ref>: an automatic route that processes spatial information irrelevant to the task and a controlled route that processes task-relevant information (i.e., stimulus direction), based on the instructed S-R mapping (e.g., "Press the left-hand key if the stimulus is pointing or looking to the left"). On incongruent trials, these two routes activate competing responses. The automatic route may trigger a response based on where the stimulus appears (see automatic response capture, <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Torres-Quesada et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">van Campen et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">2018)</ref>, while the controlled route tries to guide the response based on its direction <ref type="bibr">(Ridderinkhof, 2002a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Ridderinkhof, , 2002b;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Ulrich et al., 2015)</ref>. This conflict typically results in slower reaction times (RTs) and increased error rates.</p><p>However, the mechanisms underlying the RCE observed with gaze targets remain under debate. Several theoretical accounts have been proposed over time, emphasizing either a social component <ref type="bibr">(Cañadas &amp; Lupiañez, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Edwards et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr">Marotta et al., 2018)</ref>, stimulus perceivability <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Chen et al., 2022)</ref>, or difficulties in accessing task-relevant information <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">(Tanaka et al., 2024</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">(Tanaka et al., , 2025a))</ref>. Other accounts have aimed to integrate both perspectives within a unified framework, proposing that gaze might trigger general mechanisms shared with arrows, and additional social-specific mechanisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Hemmerich et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Ponce et al., 2025a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Ponce et al., , 2025b;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Román-Caballero et al., 2021a</ref><ref type="bibr">, 2021b)</ref>. In other words, these accounts have proposed that social targets also trigger the cognitive mechanisms that lead to an SCE, but the final effect that is observed is reversed by the additional implication of social mechanisms.</p><p>Empirical research has explored the conditions under which the RCE emerges, providing important insights into the factors that shape this effect. It has been consistently observed with eyegaze stimuli, whether presented as isolated eyes <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Chacón-Candia et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Ishikawa et al., 2021)</ref> or full-face targets <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Cañadas &amp; Lupiáñez, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Hemmerich et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Román-Caballero et al., 2021a)</ref>. However, it does not appear with other directional stimuli like pointing hands or words <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bonventre &amp; Marotta, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr">Dalmaso et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Hemmerich et al., 2022)</ref>.</p><p>Interestingly, the RCE has also been observed with non-traditional cues, such as tongues <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">(Tanaka et al., 2024)</ref>, some animal faces <ref type="bibr">(Ishikawa et al., 2024)</ref>, inverted faces <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">(Tanaka et al., 2023)</ref>, and to a lesser extent with non-social targets <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Román-Caballero et al., 2021a)</ref>. These findings suggest that social meaning or stimulus familiarity may contribute to the effect but are not the only determining factors.</p><p>Developmental evidence supports the view that whereas the SCE is already shown by 4-year-old children the RCE emerges gradually with age. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Aranda-Martín et al. (2022)</ref> found that, contrary to the effect observed in adult samples, gaze stimuli elicited an SCE in children under 12 years, whereas adolescents (12-17 years) already exhibited the usual reversed effect measured commonly in adults. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Hemmerich et al. (2022)</ref> observed the usual SCE for non-social stimuli, either arrows or words, and the opposite RCE for social stimuli, i.e., gaze (either cropped eyes or full faces). However, by analyzing the congruency sequence effect, they showed that both social and non-social stimuli induced the same effect in the following trial. Thus, after both incongruent arrow trials and incongruent gaze trials, the same reduced standard congruency influence was observed, which manifested as an increase in the RCE for social stimuli, and a reduction in the SCE for non-social stimuli. Similarly, after both congruent arrow trials and congruent gaze trials, there was an increase in the standard congruency influence, manifested as a reduction in the RCE for social stimuli, and an increase in the SCE for nonsocial stimuli. Notably, this differential pattern emerged even when social and non-social stimuli were intermixed within the same experimental block. <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Román-Caballero et al. (2021a</ref><ref type="bibr">, 2021b)</ref> showed that increasing the perceptual background complexity produced a similar effect, reducing the SCE for arrows and enhancing the RCE for gaze targets. In their study, arrows were presented against complex backgrounds to simulate the perceptual complexity of social stimuli, specifically eyes embedded in faces. They argued that the need to segregate the target from its background introduces a temporal delay in extracting taskrelevant information. This delay allows the irrelevant spatial code to decay (temporal-delay hypothesis; Hommel, 1993), thereby reducing spatial conflict. When the perceptual salience of the directional information was increased by presenting the target alone after the background a larger SCE (and a reduced RCE) was observed. However, for eyes alone or embedded in faces, the RCE remained robust across experiments.</p><p>Neurophysiological findings further support the distinction between non-social and social mechanisms underlying the effect observed for social targets. <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Marotta et al. (2019)</ref> found that both social and non-social stimuli elicited similar early event-related potential components (P1 and N1) but diverged at later stages (N2 and P3), suggesting commonalities and differences in conflict resolution processes. Complementary functional magnetic resonance results showed overlapping activation in right parieto-temporo-occipital regions for both arrow and gaze stimuli during conflict resolution, along with distinct activation patterns in the frontal eye field and occipital regions <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Narganes-Pineda et al., 2023)</ref>.</p><p>Thus, whereas a general spatial conflict mechanism might be common for social and nonsocial targets, an additional social mechanism may be induced by social targets, with socially oriented hypotheses proposing these two mechanisms to be distinct. The eye-contact hypothesis proposes that incongruent gaze stimuli (e.g., a left looking gaze presented at the right) are perceived as "looking at" the participants, thereby facilitating responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Cañadas &amp; Lupiáñez, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr">Marotta et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Ponce et al., 2025a)</ref>. The joint attention hypothesis posits that incongruent trials align participants' attention with the stimulus direction (joining attention at fixation), thus enhancing response speed <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Edwards et al., 2020)</ref>. Conversely, the joint distraction hypothesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Hemmerich et al., 2022)</ref> suggests that congruent gaze cues (e.g., a left looking gaze presented at the right) may automatically divert attention away from the task space, making it necessary to reorient attention back to the relevant task area, thus slowing RTs.</p><p>Support for the social nature of the additional mechanism triggered by social targets includes findings that the RCE is modulated by facial emotion <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Jones, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Marotta et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Torres-Marín et al., 2017)</ref>, it is negatively correlated with social anxiety scores for gaze targets but not arrows or words <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Ishikawa et al., 2021)</ref>, and it is influenced by stimulus familiarity <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Ishikawa et al., 2024)</ref>. However, these interpretations have been challenged. <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Narganes-Pineda et al. (2022)</ref> showed that explicit processing of stimulus direction was necessary to elicit the RCE, contradicting the automaticity assumed by the eye-contact hypothesis. The developmental results from <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Aranda-Martín et al. (2022)</ref> also raise questions about the sufficiency of joint attention mechanisms in explaining the RCE, since such mechanisms emerge before age four <ref type="bibr">(Mundy et al., 2007)</ref>. Additionally, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Aranda-Martín et al. (2023)</ref> found that adding external objects or frames to reduce distraction in congruent trials did not diminish the RCE, challenging the joint distraction account.</p><p>This has led some authors to question the social nature of the additional mechanisms reversing the SCE, by arguing that the RCE might not require any social processing and could rather be explained by perceptual or task-related dynamics alone. For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Chen et al. (2022)</ref> found that stimuli with similar perceptual features elicited comparable congruency effects regardless of their social nature. When perceptually simplified, both gaze and arrow stimuli produced an SCE (Experiment 3), whereas more complex stimuli (Experiment 2) showed no significant difference between social and non-social targets, suggesting that stimulus perceivability plays a key role (although see <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Cañadas &amp; Lupiáñez, 2012)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Tanaka et al. (2024)</ref> observed an RCE using tongues as directional stimuli and proposed the dual-stage hypothesis, based on the activationsuppression framework <ref type="bibr">(Ridderinkhof, 2002a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Ridderinkhof, , 2002b))</ref>. According to this model, in the first stage, background segregation delays access to taskrelevant information, allowing irrelevant spatial codes to decay <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Román-Caballero et al., 2021a;</ref><ref type="bibr">2021b)</ref>. In the second stage, selective inhibition acts on the remaining spatial code. If the spatial and directional codes are congruent, inhibition may suppress the correct response, delaying it. In contrast, during incongruent trials, inhibition suppresses the incorrect response code, facilitating the correct response. With simple stimuli like arrows, this mechanism may not engage quickly enough, resulting in the typical SCE. However, if directional information is sufficiently delayed or inhibition strongly activated, even arrows might elicit an RCE.</p><p>Nevertheless, it remains unclear whether perceptual difficulty alone is sufficient to produce the RCE. While some studies have shown the RCE with non-social stimuli, its magnitude tends to be smaller and less consistent than the RCE observed with gaze <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Román-Caballero et al., 2021a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Tanaka et al., 2025a)</ref>. In addition, some of those studies used mosaic patterns derived from faces, which might still trigger face-specific processing. As such, the role of perceptual complexity alone in generating the RCE has not been directly tested.</p><p>Interestingly, the RCEs elicited by non-social stimuli appear to differ in important ways from those elicited by social stimuli. This difference can be seen from a detailed examination of the temporal dynamics underlying location-based conflict effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Ponce et al., 2025a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Ponce et al., , 2025b;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Tanaka et al., 2025a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Tanaka et al., , 2025b))</ref>. Using the conditional accuracy function (CAF), a method that links accuracy to response speed <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Heitz, 2014)</ref>, recent studies have shown that among the fastest responses social stimuli not only lead to lower accuracy for both congruent and incongruent trials, but also elicit a reversal pattern, with more errors on congruent than incongruent trials <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Ponce et al., 2025a)</ref>. This effect was especially pronounced for full-face and emotional face stimuli, suggesting that beyond the typical response capture driven by taskirrelevant spatial location (as seen with non-social stimuli; <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Torres-Quesada et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr">Ridderinkhof, 2002a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Ridderinkhof, , 2002b;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">van Campen et al., 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">van Campen et al., , 2018))</ref>, social targets may activate distinct cognitive mechanisms that modulate early processing stages. Delta function analyses, which assess how the spatial Stroop effect varies across response latencies <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(De Jong et al., 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Pratte et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Speckman et al., 2008)</ref>, have also shown a distinctive pattern of RCE dynamics in response to social stimuli. The RCE remains consistent from the second quantile onward in a five-point delta function <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Ponce et al., 2025b)</ref>, and across the entire distribution in a four-point delta function <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">(Tanaka et al., 2025a)</ref>. In contrast, for non-social targets embedded in complex backgrounds, the reversal tends to emerge only in the slower portions of the distribution and with a smaller magnitude <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">(Tanaka et al., 2025a)</ref>. These findings suggest that gaze stimuli, whether isolated eyes or full-face images, may elicit specific patterns either due to their social nature or their perceptual complexity and configuration.</p><p>The present pre-registered study investigated whether the RCE is primarily driven by domain-specific social mechanisms or can also arise from task-related factors, such as difficulty in accessing task-relevant information due to increased visual complexity. Previous research has shown that non-social stimuli can occasionally elicit small RCEs, though typically with weaker and less consistent patterns than those found with social stimuli. Building on these findings, we pre-registered the hypothesis that greater difficulty would weaken the SCE, while additional social features are necessary to fully reverse it (see Section 2.1.5.).</p><p>To test this hypothesis, we first examined whether a reversal of the spatial Stroop effect could be elicited by perceptual complexity alone, in the absence of social content. Building on <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Román-Caballero et al. (2021a</ref><ref type="bibr">, 2021b)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Tanaka et al. (2024</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Tanaka et al. ( , 2025a))</ref>, we manipulated the ease of processing directional information in non-social stimuli (arrows) by overlaying them with different levels of visual noise using overlapping oblique lines acting as a mask, creating three degrees of difficulty (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). This masking manipulation, conceptually related to techniques used in masked priming studies that often yield the negative compatibility effect (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Eimer &amp; Schlaghecken, 2002)</ref>, was intended to hinder access to directional information without introducing social features.</p><p>We predicted that increasing perceptual difficulty would lead to a gradual reduction in the SCE. However, a full reversal (i.e., an RCE) would only occur with social stimuli. In contrast, if a clear RCE were to be observed with increased perceptual difficulty for non-social stimuli, the social nature of the mechanism producing the RCE observed with gaze would be called into question.</p><p>In addition, we examined the temporal dynamics of interference using two distributional analyses: CAF and delta plots. Prior research has shown that increasing perceptual demands, such as through reduced visibility <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Mittelstädt &amp; Miller, 2020)</ref>, added conflicting layers <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Scerrati et al., 2017)</ref>, or decreased discriminability <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Ellinghaus et al., 2024)</ref>, can modulate interference in location-based conflict tasks. Accordingly, we expected to observe changes in conflict dynamics, but not the early accuracy reversal or full RCE typically associated with social stimuli.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Experiment 1</head><p>In Experiment 1, we aimed to investigate whether hindering access to task-relevant directional information is sufficient to reduce or eliminate spatial interference, even when using only non-social stimuli (i.e., arrows). To do so, we manipulated perceptual difficulty by masking arrow stimuli with several oblique lines (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>), creating three levels of difficulty. This masking technique was intended to impede the extraction of arrow direction, without introducing background complexity or social content.</p><p>For level-1 stimuli, we expected to observe the SCE, as the irrelevant information still impacts on the processing of the relevant directional information. For level-2 stimuli, we predicted a reduction in the SCE compared to level-1, as increased visual noise would hinder directional processing and allow spatial codes to decay or be inhibited. Finally, for level-3 arrows, we expected that spatial interference would be eliminated as taskirrelevant spatial codes should decay or be fully inhibited before response selection.</p><p>In the CAF analysis, we expected the typical pattern for level-1 arrows: lower accuracy rates for incongruent trials in the fastest responses, and stable accuracy for congruent trials across the distribution. For level-2 and level-3 arrows, we anticipated an overall reduction in accuracy, particularly in the fastest responses, and no congruency difference in accuracy reflecting increased difficulty in extracting relevant directional information.</p><p>In the delta plots analysis, we expected a stronger SCE in the fastest responses, reflecting early interference from irrelevant information that gradually decays or is inhibited over time. For level-2 and level-3 arrows, we expected a similar pattern, larger SCE in the fastest responses, followed by a reduction approaching zero at slower RTs.</p></div>

Participants first completed 15 practice trials, followed by two experimental blocks of 192 trials each. All three levels of target difficulty were randomly intermixed within each block. Each block included 64 congruent and 64 incongruent trials per target type, yielding a total of 384 experimental trials.</p><p>Participants performed a spatial Stroop task in which they were instructed to respond as quickly and accurately as possible to the direction of the arrow (left or right) while ignoring its spatial location. Each trial began with a central fixation cross (1000 ms), followed by the lateralized arrow target (pointing left or right), which remained onscreen until a response was made or for a maximum of 2000 ms (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). Incorrect responses were followed by auditory feedback lasting 1500 ms. Participants were instructed to fixate on the central cross and to respond using the "C" key for left-pointing arrows and the "M" key for rightpointing arrows, regardless of the stimulus location.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.4.">Design and Statistical Analysis</head><p>The study employed a 3 × 2 within-subjects design with two factors: target type (level-1, level-2, level-3 arrows) and congruency (congruent vs. incongruent). Repeated-measures ANOVAs tested the two main effects and their interaction for both RT and accuracy. Given a significant interaction, we conducted paired two-tailed t-tests comparing congruent and incongruent trials within each target type (Bonferroni-corrected). As preregistered, we also computed spatial interference effects (incongruent minus congruent RTs), which were tested against zero and compared across target types.</p><p>Conditional Accuracy Function (CAF) analyses were conducted to explore temporal dynamics in performance. RTs were sorted from fastest to slowest and divided into five equal-sized bins (20% each), following procedures from previous studies (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Hübner &amp; Töbel, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Ponce et al., 2025a)</ref>. Accuracy was calculated per participant within each combination of target type, congruency, and bin, yielding a 3 × 2 × 5 repeated-measures design. Delta function analyses were performed on correct responses using quantile averaging <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Ratcliff, 1979)</ref>. RT quantiles were estimated using R's quantile function with the type 8 estimator <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Hyndman &amp; Fan, 1996)</ref> at the following probabilities: .1, . <ref type="bibr">3, .5, .7, and .9 (e.g., Grange, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Ponce et al., 2025b)</ref>. Delta values were calculated as the difference between RTs on incongruent and congruent trials at each quantile. This yielded a 3 × 5 design (target type × quantile). For both CAF and delta function analyses, repeated-measures ANOVAs tested for main effects and interactions. Additional paired t-tests (Bonferroni-corrected) compared congruency levels within each CAF bin by target type and assessed differences in delta values across target types and quantiles. One-sample t-tests were also used to determine whether delta values at each quantile significantly differed from zero.</p></div>

Critically, there was a significant interaction between target type and congruency, F(2, 66) = 22.23, p &lt; .001, η 2 p = .40. Follow-up analyses revealed an SCE for level-1 arrows, t(33) = -3.84, p &lt; .001, dz = -0.66, with faster responses in congruent than incongruent trials, and an RCE for both level-2, t(33) = 2.47, p = .019, dz = 0.42, and level-3 arrows, t(33) = 2.53, p = .016, dz = 0.43, with faster responses for incongruent than congruent trials (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>).

For the fastest RT bin, only level-1 arrows showed a congruency effect, t(33) = 2.97, p = .006, dz = 0.51, with more errors on incongruent than congruent trials. Additionally, for level-1 arrows, accuracy in the first bin was lower than in bins two and three. Although the differences between congruent and incongruent trials reversed in sign (i.e., more errors for congruent than incongruent trials) for level-2 and level-3 arrows, these differences were not significant. However, both the level-2 and level-3 conditions showed reduced accuracy in the first bin, regardless of congruency, compared to later bins (Figure <ref type="figure">4A</ref>). Delta function analysis revealed a main effect of target type, F(2.00, 66.0) = 20.15, p &lt; .001, η 2 p = .38. Planned one-sample t-tests against zero showed that level-1 arrows exhibited an SCE across the RT distribution, with the exception of the fifth quantile (p = 0.058). In contrast, the RCE for level-2 and level-3 arrows emerged primarily in the midrange quantiles: the third and fourth quantiles for level-2 arrows and the second and third quantiles for level-3 arrows (Figure <ref type="figure">4B</ref>). The remaining quantiles did not significantly differ from zero. Additionally, the RCE increased across quantiles only for level-2 arrows, peaking at the third quantile (i.e., larger effect at the third compared to the first quantile); no other quantile-related effects were observed for the remaining target types.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.4.">Discussion</head><p>Experiment 1 investigated whether increased perceptual difficulty in non-social stimuli (i.e., arrows) could modulate or reverse the spatial congruency effect (SCE), commonly observed in location-based conflict tasks. The results provide compelling evidence that, contrary to our hypotheses, the perceptual manipulation alonewithout social content-can significantly alter the direction of congruency effects, including the emergence of a reversed congruency effect (RCE). As predicted, level-1 arrows elicited a robust SCE, with faster and more accurate responses in congruent compared to incongruent trials. This pattern replicates the classical Stroop effect generally observed in spatial interference tasks. In contrast, level-2 and level-3 arrows revealed a significant RCE with participants responding faster to incongruent than congruent trials. This finding challenges our initial hypothesis that a social component is necessary to elicit the RCE and supports the view that hindering the processing of task-relevant information can be enough to produce the effect.</p><p>Distributional analyses further confirmed this interpretation. CAF plots revealed that the SCE in level-1 arrows was strongest among the fastest responses, consistent with early response capture by irrelevant spatial information. For level-2 and level-3 arrows, the CAF analyses showed reduced accuracy in the fastest bin for both congruent and incongruent trials, consistent with prior findings with social stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Ponce et al., 2025a)</ref>. However, in contrast to what usually happens with gaze targets, no clear reversal in accuracy was observed within the first bins. Overall, the pattern suggests that increased perceptual complexity interferes with early information extraction.</p><p>Delta function analyses reinforce this interpretation: while level-1 arrows exhibited a SCE across most of the RT distribution, levels 2 and 3 showed an RCE that peaked in the mid-range quantiles. Notably, no SCE appeared for levels 2 and 3 at any point across the distribution, contrasting with previous studies using complex backgrounds to induce RCEs in non-social targets <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">(Tanaka et al., 2025a)</ref>. These results suggest that the RCE observed with masked arrows might be more robust than that induced by background complexity.</p><p>Overall, our findings show that while social targets may modulate the magnitude and pattern of the RCE <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Ponce et al., 2025b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Tanaka et al., 2025a)</ref>, they are not essential for its emergence. Simply increasing perceptual noise that impairs access to directional information seems sufficient to produce an RCE, supporting non-social accounts <ref type="bibr">(Tanaka et al., 2024</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">(Tanaka et al., , 2025a))</ref>. However, the conflict effects and dynamics of the RCE may differ between social and non-social targets. We directly compared these in the next experiment.</p><p>An alternative possibility is that the RCE elicited by masked arrows may reflect not just perceptual difficulty, but a global strategic adjustment adopted by participants in response to how the task was structured <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Ellinghaus et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Hübner &amp; Mishra, 2013)</ref>. Prior research has shown that people can adapt their cognitive control depending on task demands and expectations <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Banich, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Braver, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Spinelli et al., 2022)</ref>. For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Hübner and Mishra (2013)</ref> proposed that participants modulated the suppression of taskirrelevant information (i.e., location of the stimuli) depending on predictability. When task conditions varied unpredictably (i.e., randomized blocks), stronger suppression is required to maintain performance, resulting in smaller interference effects. In contrast, under more predictable conditions (i.e., blocked designs), less suppression is sufficient to achieve comparable performance.</p><p>In Experiment 1, all levels of stimulus perceptual difficulty were randomly intermixed within the same block. This unpredictability may have encouraged participants to adopt a global suppression strategy, reducing the influence of irrelevant location information. Such a strategy could have contributed to the RCE, alongside the effects of perceptual masking. Notably, strategic adaptation and perceptual complexity explanations are not mutually exclusive. However, to better understand the role of perceptual complexity, it is necessary to test whether it alone can produce the RCE, independent of strategic factors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Experiment 2</head><p>The goal of Experiment 2, also preregistered (see Section 3.1.5.), was to test the robustness of the results from Experiment 1 and to directly compare spatial interference effects elicited by arrow and gaze stimuli.

Building on this prior work, our results suggest that when processing of directional information is hindered, the RCE is more likely to emerge.</p><p>Nonetheless, not all forms of perceptual interference reliably produce a robust RCE. For example, background segregation manipulations, such as embedding arrows in complex backgrounds, have yielded mixed results. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Román-Caballero et al. (2021a)</ref>, an RCE was observed when arrows were presented directly on a complex background. However, in their second experiment, the addition of white ovals around the arrows (while keeping the same background) likely made the directional information easier to extract and therefore produced no reversal of the congruency effect. Similarly, no RCE was observed in <ref type="bibr">Román-Caballero et al. (2021b)</ref> or <ref type="bibr">Tanaka et al. (2024, Experiment 3)</ref>, where arrows were embedded in pixeled or mosaic textures. From a distributional perspective, <ref type="bibr">Tanaka et al.

Thus, several findings aligned with our expectations. For level-1 arrows, the within-block group showed a reduced SCE, evident in both the overall Stroop effect and the earliest parts of the distribution (i.e., first CAF bin and delta quantile). Follow-up comparisons confirmed that this grouprelated modulation was specific to level-1 arrows, with no significant differences observed for other non-social targets (see Supplemental Material). These findings are consistent with prior work showing reduced interference for easy-todiscriminate stimuli in trialwise (i.e., within-block) designs <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Ellinghaus et al., 2024)</ref>.</p><p>For social targets, gaze stimuli elicited an RCE, as expected, and did not significantly differ from other targets in overall Stroop interference. However, a group-level analysis revealed that the RCE was reduced, and not significantly different from zero, in the between-block group (see Supplemental Material).</p><p>Distributional analyses further highlighted differences in conflict dynamics. A significant target type × quantile interaction emerged when gaze stimuli were included-unlike in Experiment 1-suggesting different temporal dynamics of conflict processing for social targets. The main difference observed was the SCE at the first quantile in the delta plot, resembling early effects seen with arrows in complex backgrounds <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">(Tanaka et al., 2025a)</ref>. Nevertheless, this early SCE was specific to the between-block group, whereas the withinblock group showed no such effect (see Supplemental Material), replicating prior findings with social stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Ponce et al., 2025b)</ref>. CAF analyses revealed a complementary dissociation: only the within-block group showed an RCE, although limited to a single bin, replicating patterns previously observed with cropped eyes rather than full-face stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Ponce et al., 2025a)</ref>. In contrast, the between-block group showed no reversal of the congruent effect.</p><p>Interestingly, these group-related differences seem limited to level-1 arrows and gaze targets. One possible explanation is that gaze stimuli used here (cropped faces within a rectangular frame) fall somewhere between level-1 and level-2 arrows in terms of the ease of extracting relevant information, aligning with findings from <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Ellinghaus et al. (2024)</ref> involving easy-to-discriminate stimuli. Supporting this idea, both level-1 arrows and gaze showed lower error rates than the other targets. In both cases, an SCE was observed in terms of accuracy, with gaze marginally reaching a significant result. Furthermore, contrast analyses on the significant three-way interaction between group, target type, and bin (see Supplemental Material, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>) revealed the same accuracy hierarchy in the fastest responses: highest for level-1 arrows, followed by gaze, then level-2 and level-3 arrows.</p><p>Taken together, these findings suggest that stimuli offering clearer access to task-relevant information (i.e., level-1 arrows and gaze) may be more sensitive to the demands of trial structure, particularly when target type varies unpredictably <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Ellinghaus et al., 2024)</ref>. In line with <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Hübner and Mishra's (2013)</ref> proposal, our results imply that trialwise presentation (within-block) requires greater suppression of irrelevant information to maintain performance, whereas blocked conditions may allow for more selective preparatory control.

Future research will be needed to determine which aspects of these effects reflect mechanisms specific to gaze processing or to masking effects. Such investigations could help position social stimuli along a continuum of taskrelevant feature accessibility, with full faces potentially representing the most perceptually complex, and thus eliciting the largest RCEs in both CAF and delta function analyses. In this manner, future studies on this nature would clarify the specific contribution of gaze-related dynamics within the spatial Stroop paradigm.</p></div>

However, much like findings from masked priming studies, several authors have also proposed a close link between spatial processing and motor mechanisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Burle et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Miller &amp; Roüast, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Scorolli et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Treccani et al., 2018)</ref>, suggesting that spatial location information may compete with directional information not only during response selection but also at the motor execution level <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Mittelstädt et al., 2023b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Servant et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Stürmer et al., 2002)</ref>. This dynamic is often described in terms of automatic response capture, where task-irrelevant features involuntarily trigger a response based on stimulus location <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Burle et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Salzer et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">van Campen et al., 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">van Campen et al., , 2018;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">van Maanen et al., 2018)</ref>. For example, a rightward stimulus may automatically activate both the selection of a rightward response and the associated right-hand motor activation, even when the correct response is on the left. In our study, such response capture may have been modulated not only by spatial location but also by features embedded in the mask, thereby increasing early response activation and the need for adequate inhibitory control.</p><p>CAF analyses have provided a useful behavioral tool for exploring these dynamics. In location-based tasks, incongruent trials typically produce a higher proportion of errors among the fastest responses, with accuracy converging across conditions in later bins <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">(Torres-Quesada et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Ulrich et al.,</ref> This pattern is thought to reflect the initial influence of irrelevant spatial information, before inhibition takes effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Salzer et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">van Campen et al., 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">van Campen et al., , 2018;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">van Maanen et al., 2018)</ref> and/or before the spatial code passively decays. This would explain the standard CAF observed with the level-1 arrows.</p><p>However, complex stimuli-such as faces, cropped eyes, and the level-2 and level-3 arrows used here-show notable deviations from this typical pattern. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Ponce et al. (2025a)</ref>, it was emphasized that such stimuli may convey additional information beyond spatial location, processed within the automatic route. While initially, this additional information was attributed to socially specific features <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Ponce et al., 2025a)</ref>, the present findings suggest that a similar effect may arise from more general, mask-related dynamics. In the case of social stimuli, this may reflect shared visual properties, such as overlapping oval contours (e.g., pupils, eyes, or facial outlines), which could function as task-relevant mask elements embedded within the visual input, similar to the overlapping oblique lines used here. Although further research is needed to clarify how visual similarity and mask geometry influence interference in the spatial Stroop task, we suspect that these masking effects may have modulated early response capture, leading to reduced accuracy in both congruency conditions, with congruent trials showing even higher error rates than incongruent ones, at specific points in the distribution.</p><p>Crucially, this deviation may not reflect enhanced response capture alone but could also indicate additional conflict arising at the level of stimulus identification. The spatial Stroop task is also thought to generate such conflict through S-S overlap (Type-8 ensemble; <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Kornblum, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b105">Viviani et al., 2024)</ref>, which may facilitate early processing of mask-related elements. Supporting this view, research on Stroop-like paradigms has shown distinct patterns for S-R and S-S types of conflict <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Li et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Luo &amp; Proctor, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Scerrati et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Torres-Quesada et al., 2022)</ref>, suggesting that different congruency effects may emerge depending on the source of conflict. Additionally, when the mask contains arrow-like features, it may elicit a form of directionally primed response, similar to those proposed in mask-induced priming accounts <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">(Verleger et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Lleras &amp; Enns, 2004)</ref>, within the automatic route processing stream. This may disrupt the processing of the target's direction and increase congruent-trial errors in the fastest responses, consistent with evidence that automatic activation can briefly spill over into the decision process overseen by the controlled route <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Servant et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Ülrich et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>At a subsequent stage, following the logic of the dual-route framework, automatic activation is held in check by an inhibitory mechanism that receives input from both the automatic and controlled routes <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(De Jong et al., 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr">Ridderinkhof, 2002a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Ridderinkhof, , 2002b;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">van Campen et al., 2014)</ref>. This inhibitory mechanism is typically conceptualized as a top-down, feed-forward process <ref type="bibr">(Burle et al., 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Burle et al., , 2016;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Meynier et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr">Ridderinkhof, 2002a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Ridderinkhof, , 2002b))</ref>, and converging evidence describes it as an active process that may complement, rather than rely solely on, the passive dissipation of spatial codes <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Burle et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Mittelstädt et al., 2023a)</ref>. Although models vary in how and when the automatic and controlled routes interact, with each other and with inhibition (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">De Jong et al., 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Lu &amp; Proctor, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Kornblum, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Schwarz &amp; Miller, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Ulrich et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b106">White et al., 2012)</ref>, they generally agree that the system must dynamically adapt to context and task demands <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Burle et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Ellinghaus, et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Torres-Quesada et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Ulrich et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>From this perspective, variations in automatic activation, such as earlier onset or increased strength, should be matched by corresponding adjustments in inhibition. If activation rises sooner or more strongly, as our findings suggest, inhibition must also be initiated earlier and build more rapidly to preserve performance. Indeed, controlled inhibition has been described as a flexible mechanism, adaptable in strength, onset, and buildup rate <ref type="bibr">(Ridderinkhof et al., 2002a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Ridderinkhof et al., , 2002b))</ref>, and capable of online, reactive adjustment during execution <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Burle et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Scorolli et al., 2015)</ref>. These properties offer a plausible account of our results and have previously been associated with RCE patterns observed for social targets <ref type="bibr">(Tanaka et al., 2024</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">(Tanaka et al., , 2025a))</ref>.</p><p>In our study, masked arrows may have amplified early response capture while simultaneously triggering earlier and stronger inhibition, an interpretation supported by the delta plot findings, which showed spatial interference to be markedly reduced among the fastest responses, with the RCE emerging more clearly in the middle range. As noted in the introduction, delta functions represent the time course of congruency effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(De Jong et al., 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Pratte et al., 2010)</ref>. Thus, this early reduction suggests that spatial interference was initially very low, potentially due to the early increase in inhibition, rather than a background segregation mechanism <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">(Tanaka et al., 2024)</ref>, contrasting with the typical patterns observed for unmasked arrows <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Castel et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Ponce et al., 2025b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Tanaka et al., 2025a)</ref>, arrows embedded in complex backgrounds <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">(Tanaka et al., 2025a)</ref>, and, more broadly, in location-based tasks involving simpler stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Luo &amp; Proctor, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Mittelstädt &amp; Miller, 2020)</ref>.</p><p>This initial suppression may have created conditions for an interaction between additional automatic information, delayed processing of directional relevant information due to the masking effect, and inhibitory mechanisms, ultimately facilitating the RCE. As proposed in prior work <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Ponce et al., 2025b)</ref>, following the second stage of the dualstage hypothesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">(Tanaka et al., 2024</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">(Tanaka et al., , 2025b))</ref>, one possible scenario is that on incongruent trials, the incorrect response (based on spatial information) is inhibited very early, as reflected in the delta function, so that when the relevant directional code becomes available, the correct response can proceed quickly and accurately as the only remaining, uninhibited option. In contrast, on congruent trials, the inhibitory mechanism suppresses the correct response initially activated by spatial information. Once the relevant directional code is processed, the system must first release this inhibition before executing the response, resulting in slower RTs and, if not resolved in time, increased early errors, consistent with our CAF findings.</p><p>A similar mechanism may underlie gazerelated RCEs. Like masked arrows, gaze can function as a perceptually complex stimulus from which directional information must be extracted amid competing features <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Román-Caballero et al., 2021a</ref><ref type="bibr">, 2021b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Tanaka et al., 2024)</ref>. This complexity may delay access to the relevant signal and recruit inhibition to filter out irrelevant information, effectively making gaze operate as if it were a masked stimulus. Further supporting this view, reducing the complexity of eye stimuli (e.g., using clearly visible schematic eyes) to facilitate access to relevant information results in the SCE <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Chen et al., 2022)</ref>.</p><p>Although faces are generally thought to be processed holistically <ref type="bibr">(Hadders-Algra, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Rossion, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Tanaka &amp; Gordon, 2011)</ref>, with the eyes serving as an anchor point <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Itier et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Itier &amp; Preston, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Nemrodov et al., 2014)</ref>, explicit task instructions to attend to gaze direction may disrupt this holistic processing. If this is the case, the face would be treated part by part, with irrelevant features acting like a mask and engaging inhibitory mechanisms to facilitate extraction of gaze direction. This account is consistent with the RCE observed for inverted faces <ref type="bibr">(Marotta &amp; Lupiáñez, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Tanaka et al., 2023)</ref>, where holistic processing is impaired and feature-based processing predominates <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Rossion, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Tanaka &amp; Farah, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Tanaka &amp; Gordon, 2011)</ref>. It also might underlie the findings of <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Narganes-Pineda et al. (2022)</ref>, who observed the RCE only when participants were explicitly instructed to process gaze direction.</p><p>At the same time, we cannot exclude the possibility that gaze engages additional mechanisms tied to its social nature <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Hemmerich et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Marotta et al., 2019)</ref>, as suggested by further distinctions observed in distributional analyses <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Ponce et al., 2025b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Tanaka et al., 2025a)</ref>. In addition, prior work has demonstrated that the RCE can be modulated by facial emotion <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Jones, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Marotta et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Torres-Marín et al., 2017)</ref>, stimulus familiarity <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Ishikawa et al., 2024)</ref>, and individual social anxiety <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Ishikawa et al., 2021)</ref>. Thus, the RCE for gaze may reflect a combination of general inhibitory dynamics linked to perceptual complexity and uniquely social processes.</p><p>Critically, this mechanism does not require additional stages beyond those described in the dual-route framework, and a top-down inhibitory mechanism. Rather, it suggests that the RCE may result from adaptive modulations of core parameters within the same architecture, shaped by specific stimulus properties and task demands. Nonetheless, this interpretation does not exclude alternative explanations of the RCE, which future research should continue to examine.</p><p>For instance, some findings suggest that target onset may automatically engage inhibitory motor-related processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">(Treccani et al., 2018)</ref>, paralleling the dynamics suggested in some masked priming accounts (e.g., self-inhibition hypothesis; <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Schlaghecken et al., 2008)</ref>. In this view, bottom-up mechanisms contribute an additional layer of control, whereby activating one response automatically inhibits its alternative, and vice versa. This has been used to explain the negative compatibility effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Eimer &amp; Schlaghecken, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Schlaghecken et al., 2008)</ref>, and could provide a comparable account for the RCE, where inhibition of one response alternative leads to disinhibition of the opposite response.</p><p>Additionally, as discussed earlier, participants appeared to adopt a global strategy based on target predictability (see Experiment 2), which modulated the interference effect to some extent. In this context, cognitive control strategies are often conceptualized as either sustained (global) or reactive (trial-by-trial) responses to conflict <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">(Torres-Quesada et al., 2022)</ref>. However, the RCE persisted for the most complex targets regardless of presentation format, and the direction of Stroop interference remained stable across blocks (see Supplemental Material). These patterns suggest that, despite global adjustments, the RCE may be driven by trial-level mechanisms. This view is supported by the dual-route framework and accumulation models, which emphasize single-trial adjustments in conflict resolution via dynamic tuning of key parameters <ref type="bibr">(Lee &amp; Sewell, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr">Ridderinkhof, 2002a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Ridderinkhof, , 2002b;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Ulrich et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Overall, these findings suggest that the emergence and magnitude of the RCE are shaped by perceptual complexity, control mechanisms and task-related dynamics. By examining accuracy and interference across the RT distribution, we revealed patterns that would be missed by mean-based analyses.</p><p>This approach supports prior recommendations to use distributional methods to capture the temporal profile of conflict <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Balota &amp; Yap, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Ellinghaus et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Mittelstädt &amp; Miller, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Pratte et al., 2010)</ref>. Moreover, our results align with those of <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Román-Caballero et al. (2021a</ref><ref type="bibr">, 2021b)</ref>, who found that reductions in the SCE often co-occur with increases in the RCE, suggesting a functional link between them. Although a full examination of this relationship was not the focus of the present study, our findings underscore the need for future research to clarify when the RCE is enhanced or suppressed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusions</head><p>This study reveals that the RCE, typically observed with social targets, can also be elicited with non-social stimuli when directional information is masked by overlapping features. This supports the view that the RCE is not exclusive to social processing but can arise from general constraints on information accessibility and cognitive control. By integrating insights from the dual-route framework and masked priming literature, we suggest that early response activation, inhibitory mechanisms, and visual complexity interact to shape spatial interference patterns. Distributional analyses revealed that the RCE unfolds over time, with minimal interference in early responses and stronger reversal at mid-range latencies. Importantly, the comparison between masked arrows and gaze highlights a potential bridge between social and nonsocial accounts: whereas arrows require an explicit masking manipulation, gaze may spontaneously engage inhibitory mechanisms due to its perceptually complex configuration. Taken together, these results suggest that the RCE reflects adaptive control processes that flexibly adjust to perceptual complexity and task context. Further research is needed to clarify how these factors interact to enhance or suppress this effect.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.</figDesc><graphic coords="7,93.98,341.52,109.50,74.20" type="bitmap" /></figure>
